INVESTORS ARE BETTING THAT WILL BE THE NEXT GROUP TO TONIGHT. THE TECH TRADE REMAINS WEAK AND DOWNSIDE HEDGING A. INNING GEOPOLITICAL RISKS. THE MIDDLE EAST, THE UNREST IN GOVERNMENT IN FRANCE, AND SOUTH EYEBROWS, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ON ITS WAY TO NOTCHING ANOTHER HIGH. ALIX: MIGHT SEEK MORE MONEY IN THE TODAY. THE BANK OF AMERICA, GLOBAL TO BACK UP HIS CLAIM THAT TECH IT IDENTIFIES THE MOST CROWDED THE DOLLAR COMES IN THIRD. IN NOVEMBER 2024 VERSUS THE WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT THE AMERICA SAYS SHE IS READY FOR A PUTTING A TARGET OF 6666 FOR IT WILL BE THE CYCLICAL TRADE WEIGHTING IN TECH THAT WILL ALRIGHT, I WILL BE KEEPING AN OUR GUEST JOINS US NOW IN THE SINEAD COLTON GRANT. AND THERE IS A REASON WHY BIG BUT A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PARTICULARLY IN 2025 AND OF THE SMALLER MID-CAP NAMES, IN THAT THAN BIG TECH AND THE SINEAD: FIRST OF ALL, AI IS A HAVE TO REMEMBER HOW THAT WILL BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TECH HIGH, BUT WHEN YOU SEE THE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS, THE VAST TECH SECTOR. THAT HELPS A LOT. SOME ROTATION. WE LIKE MID-CAPS. HOSTAGE TO INTEREST RATES AS AND WE THINK INDUSTRIALS AND THIS ENVIRONMENT. ROMAINE: THAT, OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE HAVE TO GO STOCK BY STOCK OR RATHER THAN A BROAD MOVE HIGHER IT'S A LIVE INDIVIDUAL LOOK, STOCKS COME BACK TO THE INTEREST RATES. NAMES. THE BOARD. TAKE IT BACK TO THE U.S. BELIEFS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS ECONOMY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOPED ECONOMY. ENOUGH IS THE FACT THAT WHEN PANDEMIC, END OF 2019, SINCE U.S. HAS BEEN 11.4%. MARKET IS THE E.U. THAT IS A HUGE TAILWIND FOR U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM CONTINUES IN WE WOULD CALL IT AMERICAN DOES IT STAY WITH TECH OR CAN LEADERSHIP IF WE BROADEN OUT, WEIGHTED TOWARD TECH? SINEAD: WE WILL SEE BENEFITS FROM AI TO HEALTH CARE LOOKS INTERESTING. FIRST SIGNS OF POTENTIALLY THE SECTOR TOO. AI IMPLICATIONS ARE BROADER. WHAT WOULD BE THE THESIS THAT SINEAD: SECTOR, AND MORE ABOUT BROADER YOU MENTIONED A FEW MOMENTS AGO OUT THERE. OUTSTANDING LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT IT IS VERY HIGH. THE U.S. IS VERY MUCH A BENEFICIARY OF HIGH-YIELD OR IN THE CONTEXT OF THERE IS A HUGE APPETITE. HIGH. COSTS NOW THAN WE SPEND ON THE THAT'S A CHALLENGE. THINKING ABOUT CHANGES WITH ADMINISTRATION, HOW THEY WANT HAVE A DIFFERENT ABILITY TO 20 AND 2017 WHEN THE LEVEL OF LOWER. ROMAINE: THE FIXED INCOME SPACE. MARKET, HEALTHY GAINS IN FIXED -- WITH YIELDS GOING EITHER UP PEOPLE ARE ANTICIPATING, IS NEW POSITIONS, OR DO YOU JUST HAVE NOW AND MAYBE TRIM? SINEAD: MIND HERE. YIELDS HAVE NORMALIZED RELATIVE THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE YIELD DETERMENT OF WHAT YOU WILL LONG-TERM. SO YIELDS LOOK GOOD. WE THINK CORPORATE SPONSOR LOOK WE ARE ALSO STARTING TO LIKE EDGES BECAUSE WITHIN ECONOMIC STRONG, AND DEFAULT LEVELS WILL BUT IF YOU ARE A TAXABLE ABOUT A TAXABLE EQUIVALENT THAT IS WHERE MUNICIPALS COME IF YOU START LOOKING BEYOND THE HIGH-QUALITY NAMES, YOU CAN GET ARE NORTH OF 7%. JUDICIOUS, THAT IS WHERE BUT YOU DON'T SEE THAT VERY IN THE FINAL THING IS, BE READY WILL CONTINUE TO BE VOLATILE. FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR NEXT YEAR THE BIG RANGE. THINK WILL CAUSE THAT THIS YEAR, AND THAT IS A HUGE MANAGER. ROMAINE: QUESTIONS FROM CLIENTS ABOUT INTO THE MARKET RISKS AND TO, I GUESS, MAKE SURE THEIR THE POLITICAL CHANGES OUT THERE? IT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE, HAVE BEEN TALKING A LOT WITH POLITICS, BUT YOU KNOW THE &quot;DON'T INVEST WITH YOUR BECAUSE MARKETS CAN GO UP AND ADMINISTRATIONS. KNOW, THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE WHAT EVENTUALLY IS IMPLEMENTED. BE ALLOCATED IN LINE WITH YOUR MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS YOU SEE SOUNDS LIKE SAGE ADVICE TO ME. CONVERSATION, THE AT BNI WHEN WE COME BACK, A FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP AND HIS OPPOSITION TO NIPPON STEEL'S STEEL. WILL KEEP THE AMERICAN STEEL STEELMAKER HERE. ALIX: DELIVER VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS. LOOMING OVER THE DELIVERY GIANT. AND IT MIGHT BE THE BREAD AND FOR INTO THE FOOD SERVICES WE SIT DOWN WITH THE JERSEY ABOUT HIS BUSINESS ARE ABOUT MORE COMING UP IN JUST A BIT ALIX: SHARES OF U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP BUYOUT BY NIPPON STEEL, SAY HE INCENTIVES TO REVIVE THE JOINING US TO DISCUSS IS AN RATING ON THE STOCK. IN U.S. &gt;&gt; 100%. CLEARER EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THEY SHEETS OF THE COVERS WE HAVE, DURING COVID. THEY HAVE A NICE, TIDY BUSINESS. ALIX: IT SO MUCH WHENEVER WE GET THE BIDEN OR PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT &gt;&gt; I THINK THE DUST WILL SETTLE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND WE START STEEL MARKET FUNDAMENTALS. DO YOU THINK YOU'LL EVER SEE STEEL INDUSTRY OVERALL? &gt;&gt; BROADER COMPETITION IN WHAT BASICALLY MORE THAN JUST ONE OR &gt;&gt; YES. YOU HAVE ON THE REVERSE SIDE, THAT IS NOT A BAD NUMBER, I AM EVEN MORE CONCENTRATION. ACTUALLY YOU ARE SEEING MORE TARIFFS PROBABLY ON THE HORIZON YOU HAVE A STABLE, DECENT PRICE ROMAINE: GOT INVOLVED AND WHY THERE WAS U.S. BIG CHUNK OF THE U.S. STEEL IS KIND OF SCENE OF THE IS THERE A CASE WHERE WE COULD MATTER, ANY OTHER FOREIGN IT? TIMNA: POLITICIZED BECAUSE OF THE YEAR IF IT HAD BEEN CLEAN AND TIDY NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IN FACT, A DECADE AGO, MORE INDUSTRY WAS OWNED BY RUSSIANS. I THINK THE IMPETUS OF THIS WAS THE U.S. NEEDED HELP AS MUCH OF THE HELP. TO CHINA AND THEY HAVE A SO THEY SAW THE U.S. ALL THE AUTOMAKERS HAD MOVED TO AND JAPAN IS ARRESTING THE BELIEVE, SO HE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IN THE ELECTION. ALIX: TAX INCENTIVES FROM WILL THE STEEL INDUSTRY HERE TIMNA: HAS PRICES BELOW THE LEVELS PROFITS. WOULD BE ABLE TO CHARGE A WOULD BE BROADER IMPLICATIONS INDUSTRIES LIKE THE AUTO SECTOR OR THE APPLIANCE SECTOR. YOU WOULD HAVE TO PUT EVEN MORE IF WE WIND UP GETTING MORE CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA, WE METALS FROM CHINA, WHAT DO YOU COMPANIES WILL DO WITH THAT? TIMNA: I THINK THE U.S. PRODUCE MORE AND THERE IS MARK ABOUT 5 MILLION TONS WE HAVE DISPLACE THOSE IMPORTED TONS OF HE WOULD HAVE MORE DOMESTICALLY NECESSARILY HIGHER PRICES. SLOPE OF TARIFF EVERYTHING. INFLATIONARY CONSEQUENCES. RESPONSE, RIGHT, OF ADDITIONAL OVERLY BEARISH ON COPPER AND SOME OF THE METALS REPORTED AT THE NAMES OF SOME OF ARE THOSE REAL THINGS? [LAUGHTER] APPARENTLY THEY ARE. SOMETHING LIKE STEEL AND TARIFFS OR WALLS COMING DOWN IN ALTERNATIVES. THERE AREN'T A LOT OF PLACES THAT AREN'T UNDER THE CONTROL YEAH, WE CAN FOLLOW THE OBSCURE HAVE THE WHOLE PERIODIC TABLE. CHINA DOMINATES THAT BY 90%. EVOLVING IN THE U.S. THE DESIGN HAD BEEN TO DEPLOY RAMPED TO REPLACE IMPORTS WITH BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T HAVE IT. THAT IS ON THE GROUND. ROMAINE: BUT OF COURSE ENVIRONMENTAL DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT GIVEN RHETORIC WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATION, THAT THAT COULD EXPLORATION OF THESE BROADER MINERALS? TIMNA: LOOK AT THE COPPER MINORS AND THEY HAVE BEEN BEMOANING FOR TO OPERATING AND HOW WE HAVE MINING OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.. OF RESOURCES ON THE GROUND HERE I THING THAT IS GOING TO BE AN ADMINISTRATION, AS WELL. TIMNA TANNERS, ANALYST AT WOLFE POTENTIAL SALVO TO THE TARIFF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT THAT HE IS STEEL.

ROMAINE: YOU TALK ABOUT THE RATE HIKING YEAR SINCE THEY STARTED TO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TIMES TO CHANGES. AMOUNT OF DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY EXPERIENCE IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF EXCEPTIONALISM AND FINANCIAL THE FEDERAL RESERVE CUT RATES LOWERED THEM A LITTLE BIT TO THE SOFT LANDING. PICTURE, THERE WAS A SUPPLY OUTMIGRATION AND PRODUCTIVITY INFLATION DOWN. U.S. EXCEPTIONALISM IN THE FACT ROMAINE: DOES JAY POWELL IN THE FED I THINK THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE MENTIONED EXPLICITLY IN HIS BEST THIS YEAR TO GET A HANDLE ECONOMY IS THE ONLY ECONOMY RATES THAT DID NOT SEE A LOWER GDP GROWTH. IF YOU CAN ANSWER WHY WE WHAT 2025 WILL BRING IN TERMS THE ONE WILDCARD YOU MENTIONED IF WE END UP CRACKING DOWN HARD ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, DOES THAT THROW A WRENCH IN THIS? JOE: DISRUPTION BECAUSE IMMIGRATION SAME TIME. YOU HAVE TO SEE MATERIAL WE ASSUME SOME MODERATION IN IF WE ARE ALONG THE BASELINE AS TALKING ABOUT A MODESTLY TIGHT FAIRLY TIGHT IN THE 4% MANAGEABLE ALONG WITH INFLATION. INNOCENCE GROWTH HAS HELD UP IS DO YOU FEEL THE FISCAL PICTURE IN THINK WE WILL SEE AN THIS RETRACTION IN THE TAX CUTS IT'S NOT TREMENDOUSLY I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A PUSH THE TERROR OF HEADWINDS WOULD INFLATION SIDE.

I AM SAYING THE MARKET HAS TWO FINANCIALLY THIS YEAR, POWERFUL EQUITIES, VALUATIONS ARE ANYTHING MORE GEOPOLITICAL RISK LAST YEAR IT WAS A POSITIVE ONE. CASE BUT THE MARKETS ARE I'M NOT NECESSARILY BEARISH BUT VALUATIONS THIS STRETCHED IT'S WAY OUT TO THE HORIZON. ROMAINE: JOE DAVIS, ONE OF THE SMARTEST THE VANGUARD GROUP. SITUATION IN SOUTH KOREA AND WE HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY WILD DAY IN SEOUL RIGHT NOW AND HE WAS INVESTORS HAVE REACTED, IT IS HOUR RIGHT HERE ON BLOOMBERG. ROMAINE: KOREA.

A LOT OF INTERESTING REACTIONS THAT TRACKS SOUTH KOREAN STOCKS THE BOND VERSUS THE DOLLAR. THIS IS A CLASSIC HEADLINE RISK WE HAD HEADLINES EARLIER THAT WITH INSTALLING MARTIAL LAW, WILL IMPINGE ON HIS CALLING IT ANTIDEMOCRATIC AND DICTATORSHIP LIKE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WE SAW A MASSIVE SELLOFF. WORST DAY SINCE 2020. ONE THING I WOULD SAY IS WHEN LIKE THIS TYPICALLY WHAT HAD AND THE INITIAL KNEE-JERK THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING TO EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE PANDEMIC, HERE IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE THOUGH TENSIONS COULD RATCHET THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING THE SOMEHOW ALIGNED WITH NORTH WE HAVE OTHERS AT SEEING THIS LIKE. YOU WERE TALKING WITH YOUR LAST IMPLICATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. WE DON'T KNOW, BUT ELECTRONICS, ROMAINE: MUSIC. ABIGAIL: MUSIC? I WAS UNAWARE OF THAT. ALIX: IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE A LOT FACE IMPEACHMENT SO IT'S NOT INTERESTING WE ARE OFF THE LOWS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ONE WE FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS ELEVATED BUT STAY ELEVATED. ABIGAIL: CHART IT STAYS ELEVATED A THE TREND LAST YEAR IS STRAIGHT WHAT MAY HAPPEN, A LITTLE RESTORED, PARLIAMENT DID VOTE AND THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE IS UNCERTAINTY AHEAD WILL MEAN A LOT OF GEOPOLITICAL RIGHT NOW AND CLEARLY THAT'S THIS IS ONE MORE PIECE AND A WE SHOULD POINT OUT, THE OPPOSITION PARTY IS CALLING ON ALIX: SIGNS OF IMPEACHMENT AS WELL. ABIGAIL DOOLITTLE TAKING A LOOK STILL LOWER ON THE DAY. CLOSING BELL. NEXT, LEO KELLY. WILL WE STILL SEE TECH CONTINUE DOING NEED TO LOOK AT &gt;&gt; WHEN WE THINK ABOUT TECH THE MULTIPLES ARE HIGH, BUT EXPANSION IN THE S&amp;P OVER MOST MAJORITY HAS COME FROM THE TECH THAT HELPS A LOT BUT WE THINK ROTATION. ROMAINE: OUR GUEST KICKING US OFF TO THE MODEST GAINS IN THE MARKET AND INDICES, PRIMARILY THE NASDAQ. I THINK WE WILL CLOSE AT A HIGH. TO THE UPSIDE SO WE COULD EEK UNDER THE HOOD IS THE REAL GETTING HURT. REALLY TECH, THE MAG SEVEN. I WAS LOOKING EARLIER, META-AT AMAZON NOT QUITE HANGING ON THE QUESTION IF PEOPLE ARE PILING THEY GENERATE CASH FLOW OR ARE GAINS BECAUSE THEY ARE FEARFUL THE SAFETY TRADE? ALIX: SAFETY TRADE OR ARE WE BOOK YEAR? ROMAINE: NEXT GUEST. CLOSING BELL ABOUT LEO KELLY IS THE FOUNDER AND ADVISORS. DISCUSSION BUT I WONDER ON DAYS SEVEN, BIG TECH KIND OF BECOME THAT'S A SIGN OF BULLISHNESS OR I THINK THE REAL SIGN OF BROADENING OF THE MARKET OVER ELECTION. OBVIOUSLY. WE SAW THE EQUAL WEIGHT TO VERY SMALL CAPS HAD A GREAT RALLY IN I THINK TODAY'S TRADING ASIDE, MORE BULLISH. HAVE SUCH A SPECTACULAR RUN WHEN THEY START MOVING ON THEIR MEANS THE MARKET IS GRASPING I'M MORE OPTIMISTIC GIVEN THE TO TODAY. ROMAINE: AGGREGATE, LET'S TAKE THE S&amp;P SITTING AT RECORD HIGHS, AND THE QUESTION AS TO HOW MUCH I'VE SEEN BULLISH ESTIMATES FOR GAINS AGAIN, PERCENTAGE GAINS I START GETTING NERVOUS WHEN INTO ONE CAMP AND WE ARE SUPER BULLISH, WHO CAN SET THE IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE ANALYST THE LOW SIDE. GETTING A LITTLE OVEROPTIMISTIC. YEAR. A REALLY GOOD NOVEMBER. WAY WE SHOULD. MORE STRETCHED OUT VALUATIONS WHICH THE FIRST YEAR OF A USUALLY NOT THE BEST OF THE THERE'S SOME SEASONALITY. VOLATILITY.

ALIX: ABOUT THE 1990'S AND HOW THIS HAVE VALUATIONS AND MARKETS GO INFLATION IN A FED HOLDING EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE DOES THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS I'M THE SAME THING EARLIER TODAY? I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE LESS AND BOND CASE. WONDERFUL JOB OF DANCING A FINE EASING THE RATE SITUATION AND THEY HAVE A TENUOUS JOB. GREW BY 40% IN TWO YEARS. THAT'S THIRD WORLD COUNTRY WHEN THE FED EASES OFF THE INFLATION COME BACK VERY WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SOME HOT I DON'T THINK -- ANYONE WAITING RATES AND WE WILL HAVE THIS THAT'S NOT GONNA PLAY OUT. INFLATION IT WILL PUSH THEM I THINK YOU NEED TO BE ACTIVE I DON'T THINK EASY TRADE, JUST THEY GO UP INDEFINITELY WORKS THAT'S WHERE WE LOOK AT THE THE PERCENTAGE OF THE S&amp;P THE VALUATIONS, THE TRADE. DIFFERENT THIS TIME BECAUSE AI COMPANIES BUT SO IS CISCO AND I'M NOT SEEING DON'T OWN THEM, BROUGHT IN THE PORTFOLIO TO THAT'S JUST SMART INVESTING. BROADENING OUT IN WE'VE SEEN MORE IN YOUR CAMP AND THEY WANT ACTION DOESN'T LIE. CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE DOING IT. GET HELP FROM THE FED AND STAY MORE OR LESS WHERE THEY STRONG CASE FOR SOME OF THE ON THE BACK FOOT BECAUSE OF CASH FLOW AND THINGS LIKE THAT, I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BE ADDRESSED.
