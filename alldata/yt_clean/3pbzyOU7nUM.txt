Being Mormon indirectly contributed to your You wouldn't be here as a Mormon. I was so bored at church that I would just It was the most entertaining thing in the No, it was-- that at school in your video rather than just I was like that much of, &quot;I don't want to You're more comfortable talking about religion On your channel, yes.

It was just what I expected. Mormon s have a very strong community and I didn't have a bad childhood or anything. My parents loved me. It was just this strong community. This is just what we did. Then I just had to grow up and figure out Did you ever feel like you needed to de-convert you grew away from it? Looking back on my childhood, I think it totally Ever since I was 12-years-old, I wasn't paying I also just hated going to church. When the church was over, I would be the one I'd be like, &quot;Let's go. Let's go.

You've been viewed over 3.6 billion times. You must get recognized out in public a lot. Yes. What's that experience like? At first, it would make my day. Someone out there on the Internet recognized I'm still thankful that people do it. Maybe I'm just getting older and less excited Now I'm expecting it. I'm just lying that I cannot do it. Someone goes, &quot;Are you, James?&quot; It's just a guttural noise that I make. I just go, &quot;Whooooooooooo?&quot; [laughter] My girlfriend knows that when I make that She goes, &quot;Whooooooooooo?&quot; When an Uber driver asks you what you do for I tell them I'm a storyboarder at Nickelodeon. Don't they ask more questions?

Here's your house.&quot; I go, &quot;That doesn't that doesn't seem like What's been your most bizarre fan experience? I've only had one person show up to my house. They walk floof in my neighborhood. I've had kids on their bikes go, &quot;James.&quot; I'm like, &quot;How did you find?&quot; They're like, &quot;We saw you walking floof.&quot; I'm like, &quot;That's normal.

We recognized you from the blue car in your I was like, &quot;Oh.&quot; I said, &quot;I don't feel comfortable with you They were like, &quot;Oh, we're so sorry.&quot; I've also dealt with people who have driven Then I'm like, &quot;Oh, I don't think this is Then I've had people be like, &quot;But we drove It's like I'm not enabling this. It's so hard. You want to do it for them because you want I always thought that like, &quot;If this ever [laughter] it's this little girl.&quot; You see these little guys. Moral of the story, &quot;Don't show up to people's Anyone's house, regardless of their Internet That includes you missionaries. [laughter] part of your brand, do you feel the need to you feel like you're running out of stories When I'm making the videos, I try and think There's definitely some parts that I'm learning intricate detail about my life. That's why I haven't said the identity of Especially that because it's like, &quot;Oh you Internet to put their thoughts and opinions Then you accidentally see that, and then it this thing where they're judging your relationship else. Exactly. I would not want the Internet in that aspect I've shared other things about my lives. I've shared that I've wet the bed when I was Wow, disgusting. Get the fuck out of my house. Was there a first moment when you realized Maybe it was just growing up. I started to not care about Internet drama. If that makes sense or not care about other &quot;Oh, this is super public.&quot; This is shining a spotlight on my life. I have to choose what spotlights I want to People have incessantly shipped you with Jaden Before we continue learning about the world the most controversial topic that we have Are you actually afraid?

They want you to have kids together. They want you to grow old and die together. Well, now you know why I'm hesitant about It's because the people will make a relationship I knew that once I made a video saying that I knew there is going to be people that are But I really--&quot; I already knew ahead of time that's not good. That's not like so cry about it.&quot; It is pretty much how I felt. Did any of that contribute to you making the I'm being shipped with someone else. I'm in a relationship.&quot; For a long time, me and Jaiden's philosophy Don't address it. If you address it, then the people-- It draws more attention to it and stuff. I don't think there's ever like, &quot;Oh, this It was just like, &quot;Hey, I'm going to make Obviously you've to do it. I have to address, I cannot-- I feel everyone has done something that offends Anyone who's in the public eye, they're held Are you down to talk about your experience the history and context of the jokes that Yes, because I think this will be a good way We can turn this horrible experience into A learning lesson. Honestly, it was a learning moment, for me, tone indicators. People would be, they would write out a comment comment to show that they're being sarcastic. I thought it was like, &quot;This is a little strange being sarcastic.&quot; It's like, &quot;Do people not know when a joke I did tweet that said, &quot;I think /S is an important By using it that way- -then you were saying that it wasn't helpful. Now this is something that I didn't know. It's used for neurodivergent people who have texts. I just thought it was people being like, &quot;Oh, I realized, &quot;Oh, I didn't know that.&quot; A lot of people sent messages to my business I saw one person saying, &quot;You ableist F-word, Ableist F-slur. I was like, &quot;Hmm. don't need to tweet everything.&quot; In that case, your intention was to not hurt Exactly. You were ignorant about it. Sure, yes. It's okay to be ignorant. Everyone has been ignorant at some point. I had other people reach out to me going like, I was like, &quot;Me neither.&quot; In retrospect, you could you could almost in offending some people,- -you taught many people what it means. That's why I'm saying that's why I'm open I will be honest that I didn't know what tone I actually only found out about it when you In many ways, apologizing for something brings Sometimes it's negative because people will He did something wrong. -That means that they did something wrong. That means I should hate him.&quot; Then also I learned through you. Anytime I bring that story up to people, they're The consensus of Twitter is not the consensus I feel like we must confront the most controversial Oh, what's that? Are you actually a furry? At this point, it's just easier if I say, [laughter] Is it complicated? It's okay. [laughter] in possession of a $2,000 furry head. I did this series where I read fables, and Then I got associated with it. I was like, &quot;Haha, that's funny.&quot; For VidCon in 2017, I was like, &quot;I want to I had this furry thing in one of the fables I was like &quot;That's going to be my disguise Because no one will know that it's you. No one will know. VidCon was very big on security and they're onto the public. Are you stupid?&quot; Now, I just had this furry head. That you never even wore. Yes, not for VidCon, but then it's like, &quot;Of I'm going to make a post on Instagram, a picture head and stuff.&quot; [laughter] Then she wants to go to a furry convention.
