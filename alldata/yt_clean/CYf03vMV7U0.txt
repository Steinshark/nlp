At first glance, a missile silo might seem to house and launch missiles. But what if I carefully engineered to endure anything from enemy they're a world of their own, guarded by and breathe this responsibility. So, what of power that can protect nations, or, in To understand the full scope of these silos, it is broader U.S defense system. With massive resources the world has ever seen, America has ensured none. Scattered across the northern plains of the most strategically placed silos in the world. countryside to you, but they conceal a network form the backbone of America's nuclear deterrent. these Minuteman III missile silos, each one The utter size and scope of the network is is that the general locations aren't a secret. searching for an ice cream shop, and they'll Well, just because these missile silos are easy remotely possible. Imagine trying to break into right? The same goes for these silos. forget about it. Each facility is protected by high-tech surveillance, and sensors so the wind itself. It's the kind of fortress even Now, think about the tension inside. How do where a single wrong move could trigger global aren't your everyday officers. The men and professionals, prepared for situations most of us knowing that the flip of a switch could wipe out But that raises an even bigger question--what launch? How does that even work in today's world, relic than a 21st-century reality? Beneath the when the signal comes, you press the single action? Unimaginable. If pressing stopping any random John Smith with dreams Well fortunately for all of us it really isn't silo, you'd first need to pass through is the above ground support building that the MAF looks pretty basic. It's a small, a regular office building. But beneath the boring First, let's start with the silo itself, which Minuteman silo is a launch facility that descends steel reinforced walls. But even if we look silo is just as impressive. As you descend into the sense of isolation hits hard. You're entering weighing 8 tons, are the first hint of the silo's doors can withstand the unimaginable force of a world falls apart above, down here, we remain." steel and concrete, and houses all with the higher chain of command and other missile always on alert and always prepared for the in what can only be described as a high-pressure beep is a reminder that they are controlling And let's not forget the missile itself, missile stands ready, locked inside its launch and a daunting reminder of the world's security at it waits. Silent, lethal, and capable of But while the structure is formidable, what about unlike anything most of us will ever experience. They live there. Missile officers typically work for 96 hours straight. This is an environment the pressure? Well, the officers undergo rigorous of their jobs. Imagine being one of the few nuclear button, a button in which you hope to can weigh heavily, and as such, they are trained with holding the fate of millions in their hands. small comforts like ping-pong tables, gyms, but when you've been underground for 24-hour for maintaining mental balance. Yet, despite the question. Can this Cold-War era technology truly today is way different from the one these When the Minuteman silos were first built, they technology, ensuring that even in the event with overwhelming force. But decades later, the warfare. Today's intercontinental ballistic Russia and China are far more advanced, with anything from the 1970s. These modern weapons have to withstand the threats of their time, could While these silos are spread out across of reaction time advantage, the reality is that point where no defense can be considered Today's threats aren't just coming from rival cyber warfare and drone technology introduces silos could have never predicted. Like what system? What if drones are deployed to strike that the U.S military is now grappling what is being done to address these concerns? And in the face of adversity? answer to this, we must take a closer look no matter how well-defended the silos are, they The Minuteman III missile has been the backbone of If you take a look here, the missile sits on to absorb shock waves and vibrations in case of an even if an explosion happens close by.
