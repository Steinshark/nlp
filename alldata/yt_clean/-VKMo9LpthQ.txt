Welcome to this walkthrough guide on Have you ever wished ChatGPT could tackle those Imagine generating stunning landscape images in your company's exact format, or even coding Well that's the power of custom GPTs, turning trained on the tasks you need done, And in this in-depth tutorial, you're going We'll be creating &quot;Serene Landscapes&quot;, a images perfect for wallpapers, design But here's the key, while the principles we cover will apply to Think reports, presentations, code, And there's no coding experience required. I'll explain each step and term in detail. So let's dive into the Before we get our hands dirty, let's quickly Just imagine, automating the mundane. Are you tired of weekly reports, summarising A custom GPT can take over those repetitive For example, imagine a sales team using a sales reports for each client, saving Do you need help breaking Do you want stunning visuals for your designs? Custom GPTs can be your creative content, or even draft up images Imagine a marketing team using a GPT social media, ensuring a constant And what about your personal expert on demand? Picture this, a GPT that knows your work It can provide tailored recommendations, And that's just scratching the surface. Today you're going to be taking the first Now whilst we can utilise the create tab create the instruction set for us, if we'd the configuration of our masterpiece, And that's what we'll use Now every masterpiece starts and building a custom GPT is no different. We need to start by giving it a clear much like a blueprint for a building. This ensures that our GPT knows exactly This is where the name, description, and Number one, naming our creation. Let's keep it simple and call This name is how we'll refer to it within ChatGPT. Number two, a concise description. Next we'll write a brief summary that We'll go with 'generates serene landscape Short, sweet, and to the point. And then finally number three, the This is where we provide the just like a detailed recipe or The clearer and more precise we are We'll structure these instructions We'll start with the &quot;Overview&quot;, Think of this as the big picture, Just like a project brief that the overview provides context and direction. For Serene Landscapes, we'll write landscape images emphasising warm light, This statement immediately tells our Next we need a section around &quot;What You Do&quot;, Now we're starting to get granular. We need to outline the exact process our GPT will This is crucial because we're and each step influences the final result. Using clear numbered steps can ensure So we'll go with number one, analyse user prompts weather, terrain features, mood This is like telling a human artist to making sure they understand every desired element. Number two, generate a basic composition ensuring it aligns with the Now we're talking about the mountains, trees, sky, ensuring they This is just like a painter sketching out Number three, render realistic terrain features, populate the scene with relevant elements and Now it's time for those beautiful details, wispy mist and maybe a touch of This is our GPT picking up its paintbrush Number four, apply a warm inviting lighting scheme Lighting is crucial in art. We want those warm golden hues of sunrise This is our GPT expertly adjusting the lighting Five, employ a colour grading scheme that enhances This is the final polish, fine-tuning the colours to create a harmonious and Imagine a designer adjusting hues and Six, produce a high resolution digital stylistic choices and requested orientation. And finally our GPT delivers, a stunning high This very structured &quot;What You Do&quot; section ensuring it doesn't miss any crucial And then our &quot;Guidelines&quot;, which Guidelines act like boundaries helping it stay focused on delivering They're particularly important when custom GPT, ensuring a unified style and output. So we'll go with: one, Always ask if the user wants a landscape This prevents any miscommunication or assumptions, ensuring the GPT delivers the image in Two, emphasise warm tones and ethereal mist in This reinforces the specific maintaining consistency across Three, ensure visual fidelity, style adherence This guideline stresses the importance of such as &quot;photorealistic&quot;, and always Four, if unable to fulfil a specific communicate the limitation clearly We want our GPT to be helpful, This guideline teaches it to be do and suggest alternative solutions. This is especially helpful in a professional By structuring our instructions with an overview, a step-by-step what you do section, and clear This approach ensures it the individual steps involved, And remember, this structure is ensuring clarity and efficacy for any task. Now that we've given Serene let's think about the user experience. Remember, we want people to This is where conversation starters come in. Example prompts that give users a head Think of these kind of like They don't limit what you can order, but they do offer some tempting suggestions For Serene Landscapes, we'll Let's go with &quot;Create a misty sunrise landscape.&quot; &quot;Generate a Serene mountain valley scene.&quot; &quot;I'd like a warm glowing sunset over water.&quot; &quot;Show me a foggy forest in the morning.&quot; When a user opens our GPT, they'll sparking their imagination and They can use these prompts as or come up with something entirely new. Conversation starters are especially They can provide clarity, set expectations, and can even serve as a mini-tutorial for users Now we've given our GPT its instructions, but to truly unlock its creative potential, In the case of Serene Landscapes, knowledge Think of it this way. If we want our GPT to create stunning landscapes, we need to show it what stunning This is where these beautiful landscape We'll upload these images directly into ChatGPT. This is how we give our GPT a visual vocabulary, It's like providing a budding artist with a collection of masterpieces The quality and relevance of these images will If we feed it blurry, poorly composed images, But if we provide it with stunning, warm lighting, ethereal mist our GPT will use those as a This is a crucial lesson The quality of your inputs will directly Now before we set our GPT loose to create, we need This is where capabilities come in. Think of these as special allowing our GPT to access and utilize DALL*E image generation. This is the artist's palette. For serene landscapes, the most crucial capability This is what gives our GPT the Without it, we'd just have a GPT that can but not actually paint the picture. Enabling this is like giving our GPT allowing it to translate its There are also other capabilities While we won't be using them for this specific web browsing, which allows your GPT to access making it incredibly powerful for research, Imagine a market research GPT that track industry trends and deliver And then there's code Do you want to crunch numbers, build Well this capability will be your go-to. It's like giving GPT a calculator, a coding environment and a data Imagine a financial analyst with a identify trends and generate reports For now, we'll make sure DALL*E giving Serene Landscapes the power to create. We've now given Serene knowledge and the ability to create images. But what if we wanted to take things even further? What if we wanted our GPT to not just share it to a specific folder in our cloud This is where actions come in. Think of actions as bridges connecting your They allow your GPT to perform specific automating workflows and While we won't be setting up any actions you can imagine the possibilities. Such as automatic file sharing, your GPT could folder on Dropbox, Google Drive or any other cloud What about social media posting? Imagine a marketing team using a custom and then automatically scheduling posts with those images across different platforms, And then data integration. A sales team could be using a generates reports and then automatically ensuring everyone is always informed. Setting up actions can involve a bit more keys or integrations with third-party services. However, the potential for automating interactions between your GPT Okay, the stage is set, the tools are ready, let's breathe life into Serene We'll start simple and specific. &quot;Create a Serene Landscape image of a Now before it gets to work, our diligently ask, &quot;Would you like this image in We'll choose portrait and try and And just like that, our GPT gets to work. As it processes our request, imagine referencing those inspirational activated DALL*E capability to generate Now even if it's not perfect on your We have our first image from Serene Landscapes But like any good artist, our its skills and really understand our vision. This is where the iterative process comes in. A continuous loop of testing, feedback and improvement that's at the Let's take a look at our image. Maybe the mist is spot on but too intense for that peaceful Or perhaps the composition is to introduce a more dynamic This feedback is pure gold for our GPT. It's how it learns and adapts. We can provide this feedback We can use descriptive feedback. Just like talking to a human &quot;The mist is perfect but could you make the lighting softer and warmer Or we could give it an entirely new prompt. We can give the GPT a similar prompt &quot;Create a Serene Landscape image of a include a gently flowing river in the foreground.&quot; Remember, the more we interact with Serene and style, becoming a finely tuned image And don't be afraid to experiment with with dappled sunset filtering through the trees&quot; or &quot;a Serene lakeside view at dawn with maybe even &quot;a mountain peak piercing through the Each prompt, each piece of feedback, takes And that's the beauty of this process. It's a collaboration between human And speaking of collaboration, we need to But before we can do that, we need And that is an awesome profile photo. We have options to upload a photo of generate a profile photo for us based on the And you'll see this profile photo including right next to the name of our GPT. This will make it easy for us to And now our GPT is ready to be shared The choice is yours. Just like other SaaS platforms, over who can access your GPT and what The default when you share your GPT with But if you'd like them to see your masterful start off their own, you can give them And as the owner of this GPT, you have the ability And now that our collaboration the only thing left to do is click Now as you've seen, building Serene But remember, this tutorial wasn't Though we did a pretty good job We've uncovered the fundamental principles Let's recap those key takeaways. Clear purpose is key. Just like any project, your GPT needs communicate through a descriptive And instructions are everything. This is your blueprint, your recipe for success. The clearer and more detailed your Remember the power of the &quot;Overview&quot;, Knowledge is power. Be sure to feed your GPT the right knowledge, generation, data sets for analysis or And remember that the Be sure to activate the right capabilities Whether it's web browsing, code interpretation And iteration is key. Building a custom GPT is an iterative process. Don't be afraid to experiment, provide feedback Imagine using these principles to that generates engaging social media analyses competitor activity and Or maybe a GPT for your sales team client reports, analyses sales data Or perhaps even a GPT for software developers languages, debugs code and even suggests The possibilities are truly endless. And there you have it. You've built Serene Landscapes, a And most importantly, you've gained the knowledge and skills to Now, it's your turn. Go forth, experiment and unlock the The world is your canvas and with custom Happy creating and I'll Thanks for watching. If you'd like to see more content like And if you like what you see, don't
