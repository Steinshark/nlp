(ghostly wind) - Howdy. - If you grew up with shows like &quot;Arthur,&quot; &quot;Sesame Street,&quot; or you probably know they have plenty of room for creative, spine-chilling tales. But instead today, let's of true literary trainwrecks, to bad creepypastas, we where they're gonna go next. So let's check out 10 truly And of course, if I'm talking I'm not inviting one of and an old friend of mine: - [Dennis] Glad to be back, Strider. Creepypastas are like second nature to me, so as always, I'm happy to help. And in case any of the authors of these stories come across this video, please do not take it to heart. We are only criticizing these - Absolutely right, Dennis. These authors' stories have helped entertain a lot of people now, and for that, you have our thanks. Also, all links to the are in the description below. And with that, let's begin. Hey, Boo. - You ever heard of Ghost Hole Mine? - Yeah. Is it haunted? Oh. Well, yeah. Well, that makes logical sense. I should've known. Anyway, let's check it out anyway. &quot;Thomas: All Aboard the Dead Team.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;I will never the same again after what I have seen. I was in a Goodwill, and I found this 'Steamies That's a lucky find! Very convenient for the story as well. &quot;There was no spine or so I just thought, 'Whatever.'&quot; Fair enough. Whatever, man. Whatever floats your boat. - &quot;Once I came home, I shoved my tape into The 'Thomas' intro was in reverse, and the sky was red I didn't take much notice, The episode 'Thomas to the and it skipped to the part where Diesel was boasting Thomas had an evil grin on his face.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Instead of he exploded! So did Mavis. I saw blood!&quot; Ding! Oh. I guess we're not doing &quot;And leftover parts from the diesel's left and smoke was everywhere.&quot; I mean, I knew trains were unreliable, but this is ridiculous. Here I was, thinking a train arriving 20 minutes late was bad, but look at this. Now they're exploding left and right! You gotta be careful out there. - &quot;It ended right after with (Strider cackling) I wanted to throw up, but instead, I grabbed the tape and I don't know if I could ever look at Thomas the Tank Engine Oh, and that's the end, apparently. I don't know. Uh, this episode still managed than the &quot;Thomas&quot; episode &quot;Wonky Whistle.&quot; That episode's the real kind of garbage. - I am a very silly engine. - Look out! Oh, don't be silly, Boo. That's just boxing kangaroos. Yeah. You know, Boo, sometimes - [Boo] Yeah. - &quot;Barney: The Lost Episode.&quot; &quot;Yesterday, I was looking at my TV guide, and I saw something that caught my eye. 'Tonight only! A lost episode First and only chance to see it! Airs at 7:00!'&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Naturally, I asked my kids if they wanted to see it. Obviously, they said yes. I got the popcorn ready. They love to eat popcorn Only the most essential &quot;When the time finally arrived, they ran into the living and sat down on the couch with me. It started, the theme music playing. However, something wasn't right.&quot; When is it ever right in these stories? - &quot;For starters, I could during the music, and it sounded creepy. But I shrugged it off, assuring myself that it Anyway, the episode began with the kids talking about something while holding a doll version of Barney. Then, poof! He comes to He started speaking, and I turned it up slightly Very important information there. Barney sounded slightly weird, as if two people were talking at once: one with his normal voice and another that sounded demonic. I tried to ignore it,&quot; as &quot;That's when I heard Barney Today, I'm gonna teach you about death.'&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;I nearly fell out I wanted to turn it off, but for some reason, I-I couldn't. The show kept going. Child 1: What's death, Barney?&quot; - [Strider] &quot;'This is.' His face suddenly turns He laughs evilly, and he - [Dennis] &quot;For some reason, not affected by the obviously These are some tough-as-nails kids. &quot;Barney then proceeded to kill each time roaring. The children at this point screaming and crying for - [Strider] &quot;Barney '(chortling) Mommy and - [Dennis] &quot;And he aite the chuldron. Then the green girl dinosaur and the yellow dinosaur came in, apparently not noticing 'Well, Barney,' the green one said. 'What did we learn today?' Barney grinned an evil grin and said directly to the camera...&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;'Remember, kiddies, don't bother locking your doors and hiding under your bed, I will find you and kill you all!'&quot; (man cackling) - [Dennis] &quot;The rest of the damn episode showed a distorted picture of Barney with a bloodcurdling scream.&quot; Did Shadow the Hedgehog write this story? Where's that damn fourth Chaos Emerald? &quot;That was the last straw. I reached for the remote I looked to my left, and I realized that my children were nowhere to be seen. Thinking that they I went in there. However, I didn't find them.&quot; - &quot;That's when a voice behind me said, 'It's too late, Steven! I've already killed them, and now, I'm gonna kill you. (chortling)' I turned around to see a demonic, blood-covered Barney Even when he killed me, he I love you You love me We're a happy family (Strider chortling) - [Dennis] Well, I don't know about you, but I will never sleep - Yeah! What if random guys in Barney costumes try to break into my house, too? I originally thought the chances of that were about 1 in 600 million, but this story changed my mind. - [Dennis] Stay vigilant, people. It is a dangerous - I guess it's kinda spooky, eh? - Yeah. - [Dennis] &quot;Arthur's That's a concerning title. I'm not too hopeful about - [Strider] &quot;One day when I there was a special episode of 'Arthur' called 'Arthur's Noightmur.' I was really excited about this, so I got this remote, It started with the intro, Then, when Arthur waved to D.W., D.W. grabbed a gun and Then, D.W. shot the TV with her I thought, 'Hmm. I really thought that episode What? What, what are you &quot;The episode started with Arthur said to the Who doesn't love video games? I do. So every time you see a you get excited about that.' I was relly starting to get hapy. Then, D.W. came to the door and said, 'Arthur, I shot your TV.' Arthur screamed and said, 'I don't know, maybe this The title card appeared.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Then, when he's dreaming of boats with a lo-fi beat.&quot; To study to? &quot;Then, when the lo-fi Arthur got really scared. His face was purple. His teeth were pointy and I said, 'I am relly scared! My mom watc it with me.'&quot; (chuckles) That's actually really sweet. &quot;Then, when Arthur killed everyone, Arthur stared at the viewer and said, 'I need to kill you.' And he did his Falcon Punch. Arthur: FALCON PUUUUNCH!!! Then, the end credits rolled. I started to crie relly loudly. Remember, if you see that episode, Arthur will come kill you at 3:00 a.m. The end.&quot; Well, that was weird. I guess it was just Very short, too. - Yeah, that was way too short. Personally, I'd like a bit so here's another quick story of &quot;Arthur.&quot; &quot;ARTHUR TV.&quot; &quot;The episode starts. It shows Arthur reading a comic. There was a scream on the background, and a picture shows here are, and D.W. says 'will you' and distorted it's cut to static and it shows D.W. running and it's cut a black background and says 'A week of crying later.' It shows Arthur holding A popcorn of bowl. That's quite hard to picture, really. &quot;And D.W. says, 'It's It cuts to static, and and Arthur running and take so long. It shows a black background - [Dennis] &quot;It shows and a scream on the and D.W. running. It cuts to black background ands a picture shows D.W. eyes are white and her face were red.&quot; Hey, Strider? Did you - No. No, Dennis, I didn't I think maybe that was meant of the opening title sequence? Either way, I can't say I was blown away by the effort that went into this one, but I hope you keep writing, author. - Hey, Josh. (whispering indistinctly) - No, I didn't bring a ouija board. Number eight: &quot;Kaillou Died.&quot; They couldn't even manage to We're in for some serious schlock here. &quot;I used to watch 'Caillou' when I was two, and what I think of him now, he is a whiny, spoiled brat. There is one episode that Teletoon, Treehouse season 5, episode 79. So I was playing 'Gacha and then I heard a knock on my door. I got an episode of 'Caillou.' I thought I got tricked.&quot; That is a dirty trick. Giving someone an episode of &quot;Caillou&quot;? What if they accidentally watch it? &quot;So I put the disk in, and the It went off-key at parts. Caillou was frowning the whole theme song. It flashed weird images and instead of 'Each it said 'Each day I'm sad some more.' Then it started with a title card. It said, 'The Death of Caillou.' It started at Caillou's house and with loud crying in the background. It then cut to Caillou's room, and he was crying, hugging Gilbert.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;He said to Gilbert, Gilbert re... Gilbert re... (laughing) Gilbert replied, 'Meow.' Caillou went to his mom and Caillou's mom then told Caillou crying, 'Caillou, sweetie, you're still alive, but we're going to have Caillou then screams, 'No! That can't be!' Caillou's mom said, 'I'm sorry, Caillou, but it's how life works.' Caillou cried so loud and Because of bad writing, I guess? This is extremely dramatic. - &quot;Caillou's mom said, 'Sorry I was shocked when I because it didn't say I'm sorry, what does that Caillou's just been told and you're commenting on his weight? I don't even get this sentence. Was Caillou's mom still talking, or was the author commenting It's just... (sighs) Moving on. &quot;I continued watching. There was a time card It was back to Caillou's room again. It showed Caillou with a shotgun.&quot; What? Where, where did that come from? Why does Caillou... Where'd he even get that? &quot;Then it cut to black. Then the credits played, and there was no music. I got in contact with the creator, and he or she said, 'So sorry about that. We took the episode off the We won't show that episode again. Signed, the creator of &quot;Caillou.&quot;'&quot; The creator of &quot;Caillou&quot;? You couldn't even be of the author in a It's Christine, by the way. - [Dennis] &quot;Three years later.&quot; Wow, time certainly does fly. &quot;I showed my friend the disk, So that is how the episode never showed. Do not watch this episode unless you want to risk your childhood. Caillou.&quot; Wait, so Caillou This is really confusing. - &quot;Caillou is now removed from Teletoon, Treehouse TV, PBS Kids, and So goodbye.&quot; What? Goodbye? What an odd way to end it. Okay, so &quot;Caillou&quot; was because of this episode? And here I thought it was canceled because it was boring, bratty garbage fished out of the bilest depths of the Canadian sewerage system. - [Dennis] So as I understand it, Caillou was actually bald because - [Strider] Well, not according to Wikipedia or &quot;Family Guy.&quot; Apparently, it was just a - [Narrator] But Caillou The show's creators just - Well, it looks kinda spooky, I guess. Do you feel anything, Boo? - Yeah. What do you feel? - Hungry. Well, that makes sense. Here, I brought your favorite. - [Strider] &quot;Sesame Street &quot;It's no shock that many situations that both to deal with, such as death But what many people don't know is that there was one that was too scary to broadcast. The episode was filmed in 1994 and titled 'Big Bird Goes to Jail.'&quot; (snorts) That sounds Let's read on. - [Dennis] &quot;I found out while working at the PBS Network. I had worked there since 1984, and let's just say that I The boss was a jerk, and many of my coworkers were no better. I almost got fired after Josh, in a blind rage as he snitched on me for something I didn't do.&quot; - Well, I'm sorry, but There was no milk left in the fridge for my morning cup of tea. I know you like it long black, but some people like flavor in our tea. Anyway. - [Dennis] I'll get you yet, Josh. I can't believe you've done this. &quot;My punishment instead of getting fired was cleaning out the archives. I thought that this would I wasn't expecting what would come later.&quot; I mean, hey, credit where it's due. It's kinda cool that the of a justification for upon a lost episode. Instead of just finding it randomly on the Internet or on they find it while of where they work. It's at least something. - &quot;As I was cleaning the shelves, I discovered an old tape, well from 1994. It was labeled 'Sesame written in messy Sharpie writing. I set up the conveniently and pushed the tape through the tray. The funky '90s remix of the and when the official episode began, Gordon was the one to 'Hi, there. Welcome to Sesame Street. Big Bird is very excited because today is his birthday party.' Birthday party? What does that have to I thought it was just a mistake - [Dennis] &quot;Big Bird claiming that he was really Typical Big Bird style. I thought this was any but what came next was so shocking that it still haunts my nightmares.&quot; - &quot;Two cops come by, but when they get out of the and put two pistols at him. 'What on earth is Big Bird tried to say something, but just as he was about to and pepper sprayed and Then he pinned him down and cuffed him. Gordon tried to tell the but he received no reply. 'Big Bird, you're under and attempted murder You have the right to remain She dragged the bird to the patrol car. Gordon asked if he can accompany Big Bird. 'If you want to, say the female cop taunted, snickering. The car drove away.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Obviously this a one-off prank on the PBS staff. I continued watching to It then cut to outside the jail. It stated that Big Bird has been charged with theft and attempted murder.&quot; Ah, I see. We have turned on the gritty It is quite the sight. - &quot;'Gordon,' weeped Big Bird. 'I'm gonna miss you.' Gordon tried to hold back. 'I'm gonna miss you too, buddy. Don't worry. You'll only That's not so long.'&quot; Gordon, you're one of I've ever seen, but I don't know if that was your crowning moment in terms of comforting Big Bird. - [Dennis] &quot;Big Bird, broke down realistically and soon after, Gordon shed some tears. The cops dragged Big Bird into the prison, or the Sesame Street County and one led Gordon to the exit.&quot; - &quot;This is when the episode You would expect for that the prison would be fake and the inmates would be But hell, no! The prison was real, and the inmates were just as When Big Bird and the they automatically started jumping around and punching the cell Have you ever realistically I've been to Wacol many times, and none of the prisoners trying to grab at felt puppets. &quot;He was then led into his 'Officer, I'm scared.' 'Oh, you're scared, are you? Well, you asked for it. Get him, boys!' The officers ran towards Big Bird and started beating him with nightsticks. The credits then roll over the scene, and the tape popped out Oh. Then I guess that's Honestly, Dennis, are prisons - [Dennis] Well, this was that I've ever seen. - Yeah, and I've never like this, either. As I said, prisons in to what was described here. But I guess our two countries tend to be more about rehabilitation when possible, anyway. - It's all right, it's all right. - No, it's not. - You're right. You're right, Big Bird. It's not all right. But it will be all right. (Strider slurping) - Peaceful, isn't it, Boo? - Number six. &quot;Teletubbies: The Truth.&quot; Okay, Dennis, I know we're about the most vomit-inducing, stupid show in the history of humanity, but apparently this - [Dennis] It is? Well, okay. Let's get started, then. &quot;In the years since I I've never forgotten the Teletubbies. Something there hung with with me.&quot; - Was it vomit? Apparently, &quot;A foreboding. Something that the lilty childlike music, and fluffy, impish dancing Something dark, darker than most expect. What was it that resonated about Tinky-Winky, (alarm clock beeping) - &quot;I woke up one night in a sweat. The revelation came to me, It is so much more complex I really wish it was. &quot;So thick is the subtext that it could be easily misinterpreted or missed completely by the This show is simply a warning. 'Teletubbies' is,&quot; you're &quot;a dark, Orwellian nightmare about a genetically engineered being systematically trained - [Dennis] I, what is, I... I guess I'll keep going? &quot;In order for you to see what I mean, you need to TiVo or tape an episode. Just check the listings Just watch one, and you will see exactly Then, perhaps the words that follow and the evidence I provide as they do in me.&quot; - &quot;While no backstory by the show on where one thing is for certain. They are not in control Okay, do tell. &quot;Three things control First, there is The Voice.&quot; (speaker buzzing) - [Voice] Where have the Teletubbies gone? - &quot;A tinny female voice when to sleep, and when to say goodbye.&quot; Um, I could be wrong, as mercifully, I have not watched the show in 17 years and I hope to break that record, but I'm pretty sure that's a man echoing that syrupy garbage onto their creepy dump pile of a planet. - [Dennis] &quot;The robotic, from a speaker impaled in the ground, hinting that something and is constantly vigilant. The second is Noo-Noo, a harmless-looking anthropomorphic who wanders after them, cleaning up their messes that they made and passively scolding - [Strider] &quot;Noo-Noo is the of the powers that have The third in the triumvirate is the iconic, menacing Pinwheel. The Pinwheel is the a mystical godhead that the When the Pinwheel spins, the Tubbies stop whatever they're doing and run to the top of the hill. Here, they perform a ritual trying to curry favor. They gestate and roll around like puppies having their bellies rubbed. But only one can be chosen. When that one is chosen, the genetically implanted in their abdomen activated. The Tubby is rewarded, not only by being the Pinwheel's messenger to the other Tubbies, but also apparently by a physical blare-gasm of joy at the activation of the screen.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;And what does the screen show? It shows an indoctrination film. 'Here is the world of man Learn, for you will soon join us, live among us, (chuckles) and serve us.'&quot; Among us! &quot;A message from the Pinwheel God. I call it Revnoku, just (chuckles) Fair enough, dude. It's your story, man. You do whatever you want. &quot;When the ritual of the the Tubbies return to their - And by that, he means the creepiest, most revolting things to ever &quot;Finally, watching over Oh, geez, are we really gonna go there? &quot;The innocent, benevolent hangs over it all, Kids can be jerks. I don't know what it's talking about. &quot;It is a form that the childlike and not fear, a form used totalitarian eyes that I beg you to watch and It's all there on the screen, and finally, for me, all the pieces fit. The Tubbies are alerting us to a future where genetically crafted, androgynous worker beings will serve us, slaves who will stumble and babble our way through their world, pleasing us, for we are Revnoku! (cackles) We are the soulless, immoral - [Dennis] &quot;'Teletubbies' about the encroaching darkness, the decay of the human spirit. 'Teletubbies' is about Is it, though? Is it really? - Honestly, if any of that I'd probably like the show better. But the unfortunate reality is, vomit-Tubbies is simply the and being revoltingly - [Dennis] To be honest, though, that story had some that wasn't half bad. If it was a joke story, then I think it succeeded at turning the Teletubbies on their head. It was really funny and well-done. I like how dramatic it was, and I think it was really funny. If it was not meant to be funny, it is still very entertaining, so either way, it is a win-win. Good stuff. I kinda like that. - Yeah, I agree. There was a lot of Props to the author. I'm sorry, Boo. It looks like you're - Aw. You can hang out with - [Boo] Yay! - &quot;Sesame Street Series Finale.&quot; Okay, this story's a bit I think it's awesome Let's dive right in. &quot;I'm pretty sure you've all heard of the popular TV kids' Yes, I suspect people on &quot;I is about a bunch of muppets named Elmo, Grover, Big Bird, Oscar Abby Cadabby, Zoe, Rosita, Snuffy, and the other Well, if you're sure we know about it, why did you list off, You could've just said Elmo and we would've all known &quot;I went to a garage sale I found one that said I bought it and I paid for it.&quot; Isn't that the exact same thing? &quot;Then the manager said the muppets will come She said it in a scared voice. It looked like she was scared What'd she see? Did the employee bathroom flood again? You never specified. - [Dennis] &quot;I then went home and slammed the tape I love random acts of &quot;The tape began with the but something wasn't right. The theme song had low quality, and the theme song sounded It sounded like if the tape was beaten. The episode starts with Elmo - &quot;It then shows Rosita sitting down.&quot; Very important information right there. &quot;Everyone was depressed It then shows Big Bird jumping and singing and also laughing. Nothing too disturbing so often. It then cuts to Grover flying But however, he then crashes into a plane and dies a horrible death. I almost cried. Grover was one of my favorite characters. It then cuts to Cookie and are the other cookies. But the cookies are made of real people. I almost puked. A cookie with organs? Yuck. Also, I realized that Cookie Monster had bloodshot eyes and red pupils. This freaked me out. Poor creature. I then tried to change the I then hid under my blanket.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;It then showed with pitched black eyes with red pupils. He said, 'Elmo knows where you live.' He then said, 'Elmo knows I gasped. How did he know Question mark, question &quot;I then turned it down, It then cuts to a picture appeared for five minutes.&quot; And you kept watching through all of that? I mean, I would personally get bored around the three-minute mark. - &quot;It then became static for 15 seconds. It then shows Elmo the same again. He said, 'We will learn about death.' I was shocked at first. How did Elmo know a This was insane. An image flashed on the screen. I played it back, and I then played it back and but instead my cat Chocolate. I almost cried at first.&quot; You almost cry a lot, main character. Maybe you should just, you know, let it out and have a good cry. &quot;I felt sad and hugged my,&quot; and ran out the room and turned I then called 911, but then I accidentally dropped What... How do you even manage that? How do you drop your phone into the sink? &quot;I then kept watching. It showed Kermit yelling Cookie Monster was now crying &quot;Cookie Monster had had He then grabbed him by the neck I then got worried at this point.&quot; Really? At this point in Mutated kittens, organ cookies, and Grover dying horribly - [Dennis] &quot;I saw there were characters abusing each other in a kids' show?&quot; Question mark, question &quot;That would never happen It then shows a nuclear bomb (laughing) hitting Sesame Street, and everyone died in a horrible, painful,&quot; dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, &quot;death.&quot; What just happened? - &quot;I got horrified at this moment. It showed their dead puppet bodies. Cookie Monster has rotting into flesh and organs with stuffing.&quot; He's made of felt. How does he suddenly have organs, anyway? &quot;And the others are even worser The episode then ended The credit rolled, but it was silent. I then took out the tape and Wow. No creepypasta has ever done that. Why does it seem like every just seems to have this at their disposal? Maybe they're all part of Anyway. &quot;I then threw the I then contacted Jim Henson, the creator of 'Sesame Street.'&quot; Uh, I'm sorry, how? How did you contact Jim Henson? He's been dead for 33 years. Surely being dead gives you by random creepypasta protagonists. - [Dennis] &quot;I then told him He got confused and he said that we would never put But he found out that it was who made this episode and got fired.&quot; Now, that sounds familiar. &quot;Then the police came (sighs) This grammar, man. Why are the police telling - &quot;I said I watched a list They said, 'Where did the tape go?' I told them I smashed it and threw it. They said, 'Keep it a &quot;I then watched kid-friendly I couldn't sleep for days and I had nightmares from this episode. I then looked at my window that looked simular. It was Elmo, that same look. And I saw the other I then ran away from my house So you ran away from your and then hid under your - [Dennis] &quot;I then looked, and and they sang the theme They sang it in raspy voices. I then cried out for help and and the muppets were taking over my house! I then jumped out the window, and I almost died, but I survived.&quot; (chuckling) Lucky. &quot;I then noticed a person dressed up as a bloodstained pink elephant. He said his name was who worked on 'Penguins of - And that's where it ends. I guess the author just realizing the true horror was their punctuation What do you think, Dennis? Personally, I found that story really fun. - [Dennis] I have to agree. That was an absolute and I will never forget it. - I spy with my little eye - Tree? I spy with my little eye - [Boo] Bark? - You just know me too well, Boo. Am I that predictable? &quot;The Death of Brother and Sister: A Lost Episode of Berenstain Bears.&quot; Huh, I actually still remember from where I was young. Yes, and I'm one of those people who remembers it as Barenstein, though from what I've seen, the actual title is Berenstain. Anyway, onto the story. - [Dennis] &quot;On September 10th, 2005, the 'Berenstain Bears' This was because there that was never supposed to be aired. The episode was so disturbing One day, I was at a pawn While looking, I found It was a 'Berenstain Bears' VHS. It said 'beREnsTaiN bEarS fINal ePiSoDe,' written with a blue Sharpie. So I took the tape home.&quot; - &quot;The episode started off sitting on the couch, The animation looks more more like the show's normal culolurs, although the audio was still backwards.&quot; (Brother warbling) (Sister warbling) (both warbling) So it's normally backwards? I haven't watched the in a long time, but I don't remember the audio being backwards. &quot;The newspaper says, 'New Papa Bear said, 'Brother, Sister, we are going a plane trip.' When Brother and Sister they looked upset. The screen fades out with the Bear family going on the plane. As the plane was in the air, Brother and Sister ran to escape. Mama yelled, 'Brother and You both come back here right now.' They didn't reply. Instead, they opened a - [Dennis] &quot;They began to fall and started to scream and died. Then, it showed a hyperrealistic drawing of Brother and Sister Bear's dead bodies.&quot; And for once, the author actually But be warned, it is very, very realistic. Strider, are you ready for this image? - (exhales) Okay, I Let's see it. - [Dennis] Okay, here it goes. (grunts) - Oh, jeezeebus, that's eerily realistic. - [Dennis] Yeah, I think this screenshot for minutes. - &quot;Then it cuts to Mama and Okay. &quot;The crying didn't It was realistic crying in pain. There is a slight static sound and it cuts to Brother Everything is black and Everyone has grim expressions as they stared at Brother - [Dennis] &quot;The camera cuts to with a black screen of text saying, 'The Berenstain Bears are died. The series is over. Have a nice life, kids! Goodbye.&quot; (laughing) Damn. Swift and &quot;Then the credits roll, for 'Writer: Stan and Jan Berenstain, the creators of 'The Berenstain Bears.' Then, the tape ended. I was too scared. I threw the tape in the trash can. I wish I never seen this - &quot;If you see a 'Berenstain Bears' episode that has blood and gore don't watch it.&quot; Well, author, if they've and the scary images, they - [Dennis] Well, at least to say &quot;Have a nice life&quot; and Many cartoon series are ended suddenly with no notice of their - Yeah, I mean, maybe there's about the dangers of compulsive or not making your plane's Ah, well. What've we got next? - [Dennis] Number three: &quot;The Brake Van, A Lost Thomas the Tank Thank you for including what your story is in the title, author. Makes it much easier to find. &quot;I am an avid lover of So you can only imagine my excitement when I found a DVD of the at a rare DVD and VHS store. It was simply entitled 'The Brake Van.' Naturally, I picked it up. When the man at the checkout counter saw what I had picked up, his mouth fell open. 'Wh-why are you getting that - &quot;'I am an avid lover 'Very well,' said the man. Well, clearly, with an he really wants his customers to return. &quot;I arrived home and popped There was no menu. It cut straight to the episode. The normal opening segment started, but everything seemed tinted red and there was no sign of the and there was a bit of static. Chalking it up to nothing I kept watching. Then, it cut to the episode. The narrator was like none Was that a German accent?&quot; Oh, cursed be. Not a German accent! Ooh. Seriously, what is wrong with the narrator having a German accent? - [Dennis] Maybe the author of German streudel. - Well, I kinda get that. I was never much of a &quot;Anyways, the episode started 'It was like a normal day Everything seemed normal.' According to the narrator, Percy was to take a load of rocks from Knatford Station to Brendam Docks, but there was no more usable brake vans. As Percy explained this dilemma to Thomas, all color drained from his face. 'Well, there is one 'The old brake van that as far as any of us know.' 'All right, then,' said Percy.&quot; - [Narrator] &quot;There was that had taken a dislike to Percy.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;The audio then cut out, but from what the scenes showed us, Percy was collecting his As Percy was leaving the docks, static like I'd never seen It continued this way What do you mean by static I wish you would elaborate on that. &quot;Then it cut to the top of Gordon's Hill. Percy was attempting but the trucks were starting - I wanna stop! I wanna stop! - &quot;Percy tried with all his but to no avail. This is where things get very scary. The next shot is the brake van with cuts all over his face and Music is playing in reverse and static is flashing in three-second increments. The next shot is of Percy still applying his brakes Then he came off the rails, and thanks to sparks from his funnel, his wooden brakes and the with Percy screaming in Like maybe the hyperrealistic &quot;Then the brake van told him, 'There's no hope for you in hell.' The last shot of the episode is Percy's blackened body for 10 seconds and then Percy's sad The end?&quot; Well, I don't know. That's for you to decide, author. You set Percy ablaze, so Repellent with DEET is the best stuff. Humans have been using it for 78 years and it's completely nontoxic to us. Works like a charm. - &quot;Thomas and the Children.&quot; &quot;Have you ever heard of 'Thomas Yeah, author, we all have. Yes. &quot;My son adored 'Thomas' so much that he could name every single train. He knew what colors they were and the number they had painted on them. The show started in 1984 and - [Dennis] &quot;I was glad when I heard that he was coming to but I had a ton of work to do, so I bought him a 'Thomas' DVD. The cover looked innocent enough. What was also interesting and little wooden children out of the windows in his coaches. The DVD was called 'Thomas - &quot;He was so excited to see he pleaded with me to pop I went to work while he watched it. After a few hours, he came into my office, looking pale as he spoke. 'Daddy?' His voice seemed weak. 'Are you okay?' I said. I touched his head and noticed - [Dennis] &quot;'Why did My heart sank like a stone, 'I'm sure Thomas didn't hurt 'Now, you need your I gently pushed him toward - &quot;After putting him to bed, I got curious as to what he'd seen. I popped in the DVD and began It seemed normal enough. Thomas was told to take a group by the instructions of Sir Topham Hatt.&quot; You know, the fat controller. &quot;I noticed something odd, though. There was no narrator in this episode.&quot; No Michael Angelis? Travesty! He was such a deep part of Deepest respects. &quot;It then showed Thomas picking and showed every single Then there was a scene of like he always did, and But then there was trouble, Bertie the Bus was stuck - [Dennis] &quot;This is when Ugh, buckle up, everybody. &quot;Bertie stared at Thomas in fear, but Thomas just smiled and sped up. He maniacally laughed, with little tears coming down - &quot;Thomas gleefully crashed into Bertie, causing pieces of them Usually by now, the narrator would say, 'Luckily, no one was hurt,' but there was no reassurance for the kids. The episode then showed what Wooden limbs had been broken off, and what looked like actual blood had been splattered everywhere. And what was worse, the painted on their faces. It then cut to static,&quot; as it always does. &quot;After that, I found myself What sicko would create for little kids?&quot; I then paused the static. Messages started to appear on the screen like kill, obey, multiply, and die. I watched the static and saw flash on the screen.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;I threw the after breaking it in half. I would not expose my child Before going to bed myself, He was happily asleep and - &quot;I had a nightmares from this, one where the children came into my room but they were lifelike and Their twisted forms grabbed all while I heard that Now I have woken up. I heard the doorbell ring. I found a Trackmaster Thomas toy that had children painted on him.&quot; Oh, the humanity? The poor plastic train? I don't know about this one, Dennis. Did you find that at all scary? - [Dennis] Well, I personally But I at least liked the main character in the story, the dad. He was really cool, actually. - Yeah, me, too. A lot of creepypasta but this guy seemed like a He was just trying to be a good dad. What have we got next? Ah, and for number one, &quot;Sesame Street VHS.&quot; Props to the author, by the way, for including screenshots of the show. After seeing this, how can we &quot;I was at the Family Video store and found an old 'Sesame Street' VHS tape. I bought it, but a big mistake I've never heard that - I've made a huge mistake. - &quot;I should've bought a DVD instead, as VHS tapes were obsolete, but I bought it anyway because why not.&quot; I'll say, in 2022, I honestly have no idea how you even have a VHS recorder. &quot;It basically was a combination of skits that they had a terrifying twist from an early 'Sesame Street' episode. The cover had a picture of Big Bird. However, I didn't pay attention to the 'Not Suitable for as I thought some stupid as a freaking joke.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Introduction. In the beginning, Elmo but the background is red. Big Bird, missing a eye, runs across a bridge I saw his eye in the water, and a slower, demonic version of the 'Sesame Street' Elmo eats the organs laughing while he's eating it.&quot; I knew there was something His true colors have - &quot;The next scene shows Cookie Monster in a cookie facility where Didn't we hear that before? I guess many creepypasta Cookie Monster making cookie people is just a really creepy idea. I don't know. - Cookie! (gobbling) - [Strider] &quot;After that, it shows Ernie squeezing his rubber ducky so Ernie then eats it. Afterwards, the theme and the red background disappears. But when Grover starts he crashed into the airplane The music becomes slower and more demonic, and the background is red again.&quot; Can I just say I really So far, most of it sounds kinda hilarious. &quot;This is the author's list of the episode's skits and twists. Kermit's B Lecture: It's the same, but after the screen turns white, the white fades into the causing the B to melt. Beautiful Day's Monster mouth is an eye. One of his eyes are black, and Beautiful Day's And also, the skit plays in reverse. Cracks: The Crack Master bleeds, and he rips the heads of the Bob, Luis, and the Train: When it becomes covered in organs. A bloodcurdling scream is heard, as if someone is being murdered. Pattern Completion: The makes a sound of a demonic laugh.&quot; - [Dennis] &quot;Wet Paint: Everyone sings in a rather depressing way, and the paint doesn't It resembles blood. Fat Cat Sat Mat: The three muppets force in a wood chipper. The Mystery Box: The Cookie Monster finds Count to 10 with Nobody: but when Nobody gets to and the screen cuts to static, Nobody then says, 'I'm coming I'm coming for you,' in In the Box: The monster in the box, Fred, bites Grover's head off, and Fred eats it. But Grover is somehow - &quot;Elmo sits on the step of a sunny day with a sad look on his face. Mr. Hooper comes up to Elmo yells, 'Leave Elmo alone!' Mr. Hooper leaves, and Elmo picks up a gn after 30 seconds of ooter silence. Everyone tells Elmo not to do it. They take his gn, but Elmo Elmo dies, but he dies and He then whispers, 'I'm coming.' Scene 2. After the skits, it cuts by a nuclear bomb. After that violent explosion, it cuts to a horrifying Why is it horrifying? He doesn't say. Did they all just have bad hair days? &quot;And it went to black for 20 Oh. Well, I guess that's Well, I can say with certainty this sounds like a pretty If it somehow ever did exist and was ever leaked on YouTube, I would definitely give it a look. - Greetings, little one! (laughs) - And with that, we've reached the end of the PBS creepypasta vault. I hope you enjoyed the journey, and thank you, Dennis, check out some - [Dennis] It's my pleasure, Strider. We go way back, and I always It's always a blast and Ladies, gentlemen, and all else, thank you for your time, Goodbye. - Take care, Dennis. Stay safe. And I hope you do the same. Please look after yourself and each other. And as always, thanks for watching, and I'll see you next time. (playful music)
