HI, I'M BILL PULLMAN. WHEN I FIRST CAME TO MONTANA I DIDN'T REALIZE FROM THIS PLACE WOLVES WERE GONE, AND GRIZZLY BEARS WERE BUT ALL THAT WAS YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK FOR A GROUNDBREAKING COMEBACK-- THE RETURN OF THESE BUT WHILE WE IMAGINE THEM YOU ARE ABOUT TO SEE THAT THEIR A GRIZZLY MOM RAISING CUBS AND A WOLF WITHOUT A PACK DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE THIS IS THE STORY OF YELLOWSTONE. IT BEGAN WITH AN IDEA, TO PROTECT THE WONDERS BUT FOR NEARLY A CENTURY ICONS, HUNTED AND FEARED. FOR ALL ITS BEAUTY, A LAND OUT OF BALANCE. UNTIL THE RETURN [ROARING] THE GRAY WOLF HAS RECLAIMED GRIZZLIES ARE TAKING BACK IN THE STRUGGLE OF THE CHASE AND THE TIRELESS BATTLE LIFE FOR A HUNTER IS NEVER EASY. A LEGENDARY MOTHER AND A LONE WOLF SEARCHES [BARKING] [HOWLING] THIS IS YELLOWSTONE REBORN. THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA [GROWL] [THUNDER] [GROWLING] [BIRDS SQUAWKING] [CHIRPING] MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRDS HERALD IN YELLOWSTONE. BUT NOTHING ANNOUNCES THE SEASON LIKE A MIGHTY GRIZZLY HUNGER DRIVES HIM GUIDED BY A FAMILIAR SCENT. HIS NOSE, SEVEN TIMES STRONGER BRINGS HIM STRAIGHT A WINTER-KILL BISON CARCASS. [GRUNTS] A RICH SOURCE OF PROTEIN UNLOCKED BY FAST-MELTING BUT IT'S ALSO ATTRACTED ANOTHER. A LONE WOLF. A CURIOUS ADOLESCENT LIKE MANY YOUNG MALES, HE'S LEFT TO STRIKE OUT ON HIS OWN. BUT BLACKTAIL IS ALREADY IT'S A RARE ENCOUNTER: TWO TOP PREDATORS THE OLD BOAR HOLDS HIS GROUND. POSITION IS EVERYTHING. BUT WHAT BLACKTAIL HE MAKES UP FOR WITH BRAVADO. HE TAUNTS THE BOAR HE'S HUNGRY, AND A SINGLE SWIPE COULD KILL. [ROARING] BLACKTAIL COULD OUTRUN THE BEAR, BUT HE STAYS CLOSE, [ROARING] LURING HIM FARTHER AND FARTHER [ROAR] THE BOAR HAS HAD ENOUGH. BLACKTAIL IS PLAYING BUT THIS TIME THOUGH HE MAY NOT KEEP [HOWLING] [BARKING] COYOTES. THREE OF THEM. SEEING THAT BLACKTAIL'S ALONE, THEY FORM AN ALLIANCE [GROWLING] WOLVES ARE USUALLY TOP DOG, BUT THE COYOTES COME AT HIM [GROWLING] HE'S NEVER FACED A GANG [YIPPING] [GROWL] RELENTLESS, ORGANIZED, THE COYOTES CHASE HIM OFF, AND SWIFTLY TAKE POSSESSION. BLACKTAIL WILL GO HUNGRY. [HOOVES RUMBLING] OUT HERE, A LONE WOLF EVERY MOMENT WITHOUT ALLIES, BLACKTAIL'S AT RISK. [GRUNTING] [BISON BELLOWS] LIFE ON HIS OWN IT MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE. HE MUST FIND A PACK BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. SPRING CRESTS THAT RISES UP AND RUSHES ACROSS THE PLATEAU. YELLOWSTONE'S GREAT HERDS TO ONE OF THE LAST OPEN RANGES BISON, ELK AND PRONGHORN MIGRATE IN PURSUIT OF THESE HERDS ONCE BECAME THEY OVERGRAZED LEAVING THEM DAMAGED BUT NOW, IN SPRING'S FERVOR, A RESURGENT FORCE WORKS THE WOLF PACK. THIS IS THE WAPITI PACK. THE LARGEST IN YELLOWSTONE. A FAMILY IN ITS PRIME. 20 MEMBERS STRONG... AND STILL GROWING. [BARKING] THEY ROAM THE VAST INTERIOR A TERRITORY OF 200 SQUARE MILES. PERFECT WOLF HABITAT. BUT UNTIL RECENTLY, GRAY WOLVES A CENTURY AGO, PREDATORS WERE ELIMINATED FROM NEARLY ALL SCIENTISTS HAD NOT THAT AN ECOSYSTEM CANNOT THRIVE IN 1926, PARK RANGERS SHOT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD BUT 70 YEARS LATER, TWO HORSE-DRAWN SLEIGHS CAPTURED IN CANADA AND RELEASED THEM IN IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS NO ONE KNEW IF IF THEY COULD THRIVE OR WHAT THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS TO THE YELLOWSTONE ECOSYSTEM. BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE WOLVES TO MAKE [BARKING] THE REVIVAL OF THE HUNT RETURNED THE MOST PRIMARY A PREDATOR PURSUING ITS PREY. [BARKING] THANKS TO THE RETURN THE WORLD'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK AS ONE OF THE ONLY INTACT [HOWLING] TODAY, MORE THAN 100 DESCENDANTS ROAM YELLOWSTONE. THE THRIVING WOLF PACKS KEEP BUT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY FORCE HIGH IN THE ALPINE, ANOTHER AND BEGINNING A RITE OF SPRING. A BOAR GRIZZLY, RACING TOWARDS A FEMALE. [GROWL] THE MARATHON OF GRIZZLY IS A TEST OF WILLS THE RELUCTANT FEMALE CAN RUN IN THE BOAR MUST KEEP PACE [GRUNTS] SO FAR, SHE SEEMS UNIMPRESSED. THE PURSUIT COULD LAST FOR DAYS. [ROAR] FINALLY SHE SLOWS HER PACE [ROAR] BUT NOT TOO CLOSE. [ROARING] AFTER A LONG CHASE, THE FEMALE HIS TRIAL IS OVER. A FLEETING MOMENT OF UNION WITH THE NEXT GENERATION IF ALL GOES WELL, SHE'LL HAVE CUBS AT HER SIDE. DOWN IN THE VALLEY, TWO OF THIS YEAR'S CUBS HAVE [CUB GROANS] A LEGENDARY MOTHER HER NAME IS QUAD-MOM. THE MATRIARCH OF YELLOWSTONE. ONE OF THE MOST REVERED IN SPRING 2010, ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL EVER OBSERVED IN YELLOWSTONE. QUAD-MOM EARNED HER NAME. HER FAME SPREAD, AND SO DID HER MANY OFFSPRING, WHO NOW RANGE THROUGH THE HER LEGACY HAS HELPED BACK FROM THE BRINK 40 YEARS AGO, WAS PLACED ON AT THE TIME, FEWER THAN 150 THEIR NUMBERS DECIMATED BY A CENTURY OF CONFLICT BUT, ONCE PROTECTED, TODAY, MORE THAN 700 GRIZZLIES QUAD-MOM IS NOW TIME IS NO LONGER ON HER SIDE. SHE'S AMONG THE OLDEST THESE YOUNG CUBS COULD BE AND THE RISING NUMBER OF BEARS HAS CREATED A NEW CHALLENGE: COMPETITION. A GASH RAKED ACROSS HER FOREHEAD IT'S THE MARK OF A TERRITORIAL MALE TO BRING A SOW BACK INTO ESTRUS. SHE CAN'T LET HER GUARD DOWN. SHE CATCHES WIND OF SOMETHING... JUST OVER THE HORIZON. [GRUNTING] THE BOAR'S SCENT TIME TO LEAVE... AND QUICKLY. [CUB CRIES] [THUNDER] [RAIN FALLING] BY LATE JUNE, ABUNDANT RAIN DRIVE AN EXPLOSION OF GROWTH. [THUNDER] ON CUE, YELLOWSTONE'S HERDS BUT WHERE PREY ARE MANY, THIS IS THE MOLLIES PACK, CELEBRATED AS ONE OF THE FIRST AFTER THE WOLF REINTRODUCTION. FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS LIMITING THE ELK HERD BUT THEIR REIGN IS THE MOLLIES HONED THEIR SKILLS BUT THIS TIME ON SOMETHING MORE DIFFICULT. AS ELK BECOME LESS PLENTIFUL, REVIVING THE BISON HUNT TO THE MOLLIES' A WALL OF HORNS AND HOOVES INSTINCTIVELY, MOTHERS AND WHEN DANGER THREATENS, [GROWLING] [BARK] THE PACK CREATES CONFUSION, TRYING TO SHAKE THE CALF PROBING FOR ANY WEAKNESS. WOLVES ARE BUILT FOR STAMINA. [GRUNTS] THE CHASE IS ON. THE BISON HUNT IS A NEW TEST AN ANCIENT STRUGGLE MISSING FOR AS THE MOLLIES PUSH A LONE WOLF APPEARS BLACKTAIL. STILL ALONE, STILL HUNGRY, AND STILL DESPERATE. HE SNEAKS IN TO GRAB A SHARE WHILE THE PACK'S DISTRACTED. IN THE MOLLIES' TERRITORY, AT ANY MOMENT, THE WOLF PACK THE INTERLOPER HAS BEEN SPOTTED. THE MOLLIES WON'T STEALING FROM THEIR ELK KILL. THIS IS THEIR TURF. THE TRESPASSER MUST BE IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE DISPLAY [SNARLING, YELPING] [SPLASH] BLACKTAIL IS TRAPPED [BARKING] THE PACK CLOSES IN. [BARKING, HOWLING] [GROANS] [SQUAWKING] TATTERED, SOAKED TO THE BONE, BLACKTAIL IS LUCKY [DRINKING] IF HE CAN'T FIND A PACK, THESE ARE THE TRIALS ALL HE CAN DO IS LICK HIS WOUNDS THE RESURGENCE OF WOLVES SHIFTS THE DYNAMIC BUT ALSO FOR OTHER PREDATORS. [BISON GRUNTS] CHIEF AMONG THEM, THE COYOTE. WHEN WOLVES WERE GONE THE COYOTE POPULATION NOW, THE BALANCE HAS CHANGED. WOLVES CHASE DOWN COYOTES BEARS ARE EQUALLY MENACING. [ROAR] ONLY THREE YEARS AFTER THE NUMBER OF COYOTES BUT THE GENIUS OF THE COYOTE WITH LARGER PREY CLAIMED COYOTES SHIFT THEIR FOCUS TAKE AWAY ONE FOOD SOURCE, A VOLE, A SMALL SOCIAL RODENT WITH SHARP HEARING THE COYOTE MAKES QUICK WORK [SQUEAKING] [SQUEAKING] IT LOOKS EASY. BUT THERE'S A CATCH: SMALLER PREY MEANS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE [GROWLING] [YELPING] AS WOLVES AND BEARS COYOTE NUMBERS MAY NEVER BUT OUTSIDE YELLOWSTONE, UNLIKE LARGER CARNIVORES, COYOTES HAVE ADAPTED WELL THEY'RE DRAMATICALLY EXPANDING SPREADING TO THE FARTHEST AND BEYOND. [GRUMBLING] BY AUGUST, QUAD-MOM'S CUBS ARE GAINING ALMOST AND GROWING FRISKIER [CUB GROANS] [CUB GROANS] KEEPING THEM FED AND OUT OF [GROANING] BUT TAKING A BREAK TO ESCAPE THE THE CUBS AREN'T SO SURE. THEY'D RATHER STAY ON THE RUN. BUT THEY'LL NEED ALL THE ENERGY BECAUSE THEY'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK THE NURSING CUBS HAVE QUAD-MOM KNOWS A SECRET SOURCE BUT IT MEANS LEAVING BEHIND [ROCKS CLATTERING] LEADING THE CUBS INTO [SCREECH] SHE CLIMBS TO A REMOTE FACE FEW HAVE EVER LAID EYES ON. IT'S AN UNEXPECTED DESTINATION BUT EACH AUGUST, A HIDDEN FEAST QUAD-MOM IS NOT ALONE. THE MOUNTAINS ARE CRAWLING AT FIRST GLANCE, BUT NESTLED AMONG THE ROCKS, ALPINE WILDFLOWERS. THEIR SWEET NECTAR ATTRACTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS THESE ARE WHAT THE BEARS EACH AUGUST, THE MOTHS MIGRATE THE FATTENED INSECTS BURROW DEEP HIDDEN AWAY FROM UNTIL A HUNGRY INTRUDER DURING THE FEAST, THE GRIZZLIES EACH GORGE 20,000 CALORIES, THE RICHEST BOUNTY OF FAT AND QUAD-MOM HAS PERFECTLY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SHE'LL CONSUME HALF HER ANNUAL A VITAL STOCKPILE FOR WINTER. EVEN THE CUBS HAVE CAUGHT ON, RELISHING THEIR FIRST MOTHS IN YELLOWSTONE, HEEDING NATURAL, BUT IN RARE CASES, APPEAR TO TURN UPSIDE DOWN. AND DAY TURNS INTO NIGHT. THE MIDDAY SUN IS FADING. A SUDDEN CHILL GRIPS THE AIR. THE BUZZ OF INSECTS QUIETS, AND THE FEEDING FRENZY ALL ACROSS YELLOWSTONE, DARKNESS DESCENDS. TRAVELING AT THE MOON'S SHADOW ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. A TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN A FLEETING AURA OF DARKNESS. THE COSMIC FIREWORKS AS SUDDENLY AS THEY VANISHED, YELLOWSTONE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE [ELK BUGLES] IN AUTUMN, ANOTHER CYCLE THE GREAT HERDS LEAVING THE HIGH COUNTRY AND WITH GOOD REASON. WINTER COMES EARLY SUMMER'S BOUNTY IS GONE. BY NOVEMBER, QUAD-MOM HAS NO CHOICE SHE'S PREPARED WELL. SINCE SPRING, SHE'S GAINED FOR THE NEXT FIVE MONTHS, SHE AND THE CUBS WILL RELY BUT IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. ONLY HALF OF ALL CUBS AS GRIZZLIES RETREAT ANOTHER PREDATOR RISES [HOWLING] THIS IS THE SEASON OF THE WOLF. WHILE OTHERS BATTLE WOLVES ARE IN THEIR PRIME. THEIR SUCCESS IS TIED TO THE BLACKTAIL HAS BEATEN THE ODDS BUT WINTER'S WRATH COULD BE IN THIS LEAN SEASON, AND HIDING AMONG THE WILLOWS IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WOUNDED BULL ELK, A WOLF PACK WOULD GO BUT ALONE, BLACKTAIL HAS ALMOST HE MUST WAIT UNTIL BUT TIME IS NOT IN HIS FAVOR. FAR ACROSS THE VALLEY, THE WAPITI PACK. MORE THAN 20 WOLVES STRONG, THEY TRAVEL IN FORMATION, THEY FOLLOW THE RIVER, UNTIL, IN UNISON, [PANTING] THE WOUNDED ELK. BLACKTAIL HOLDS HIS GROUND HE CAN'T AFFORD TO ABANDON THE WAPITIS GATHER THEY'RE STAGING FOR AN AMBUSH [HOWLING] BUT IN THE RUGGED TERRAIN ANOTHER AMBUSH HAS A WHITE-TAILED DEER IS CAREFULLY THE VICTIM OF YELLOWSTONE'S THE MOUNTAIN LION. [PURRING] [PURRS] HER KITTEN FOLLOWS. THEY VISIT THE CACHE TOGETHER, [PURRING] UNDER A CLOAK OF DARKNESS, SHE AVOIDS DETECTION THE UNRIVALED STEALTH ALLOWED A SMALL POPULATION EVEN AS WOLVES AND BEARS ALONE ON TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN, THE BIG CATS HAD THE KITTEN IS ONLY FAR TOO YOUNG TO ACCOMPANY BUT THROUGHOUT ITS FIRST YEAR, THE CUB WILL DEVELOP THAT LIONS USE TO ATTACK PREY. AND THEY'LL BEGIN IN SECRET, MOM AND KITTEN BUT AS DAYLIGHT APPROACHES, THEY CACHE THE DEER BACK TO THEIR DEN. THE SUN RISES ON WHAT LITTLE THE WAPITIS' NIGHT AMBUSH 20 WOLVES FED ON THEIR PRIZE LEAVING ONLY SCRAPS BLACKTAIL IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. THE WAPITIS ARE A PACK THIS SIZE NEVER RESTS. THEY MUST KILL AN ELK BUT THIS TIME, THEY'RE ON THE ON THE HEELS OF THE PACK, BLACKTAIL. FOLLOWING THE WAPITIS TO A BISON HUNT. BY LATE WINTER, AS SNOW PILES GRAZERS BECOME LESS MOBILE; THEIR WEAKNESS IS FOR THE WAPITI PACK, THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS [HOWLING] THEIR ENERGY IS THEY'RE FEEDING ON AN ADULT BISON. IT'S A NEW ERA FOR BOTH THE BALANCE OF POWER HAS SHIFTED ONLY A FEW PACKS IN YELLOWSTONE THE MYTHICAL STATUS NOW, THE WAPITIS ARE AMONG THEM. AS THE ALPHAS FINISH THEIR TURN A FAMILIAR FACE APPEARS: BLACKTAIL. HE MAKES HIS MOVE. [SQUAWKING] BUT BLACKTAIL HAS HE'S ALREADY ONE OF THEM. HE'S JOINED THE RANKS IT'S A RARE CASE. A YOUNG OUTSIDER WITHIN THE ESTABLISHED PACK. THEY'VE ACCEPTED HIM. AND THEY WILL BE HIS LIFELINE. BUT HE OFFERS NOW THAT THE WAPITIS HAVE AN ADDITIONAL MEMBER INCREASES IN BLACKTAIL, THE PACK HAS WHO WILL HUNT AND DEFEND AFTER THE TRIALS HE'S FINALLY FOUND THE STRONGEST PACK [HOWLING] BUT AS THE SEASONS TURN EVERYTHING IS SO BEGINS ANOTHER CYCLE AND THE COMPETITION IT'S QUAD-MOM THE FAMILY HAS SURVIVED AND IT'S TIME TO MAKE UP THIS TIME, THE YEAR-OLD CUBS SPRING DELIVERS THEIR NEWBORN ELK CALVES. [CALF YELPS] DURING PEAK CALVING, THE BEARS ELK CALVES ARE BORN SCENTLESS. ONLY ABLE TO RUN THEY STAY HIDDEN THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THEM IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR BUT THIS IS A GAME [CALF YELPS] [GROWLS] SENSING AN OPPORTUNITY, [BEAR GROWLS] HE'S ON TO SOMETHING. [GRUNTS] BUT IT'S ONLY A HARE; [GRUNTING] NOW, HE'S ON TARGET. [ROARING] [BUGLING] [CALF SQUEALING] BUT THE CALF ISN'T GOING DOWN [BUGLING] ALERTED BY THE STRUGGLE, [CALF SQUEALING] [YELP] [BUGLING] THE COW ELK RUSHES [SQUEALING] BUT THERE'S NOTHING SHE CAN DO. WITH THEIR MOTHER'S GUIDANCE, THE CUBS HAVE LEARNED THEY WILL NOW PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE SPAN OF QUAD-MOM HAS PRESIDED OVER THE RESTORATION OF THE RETURN OF YELLOWSTONE'S A PLACE WHERE THE STORY BUT BEYOND THESE BORDERS, WOLVES AND GRIZZLIES FROM MOST OF THEIR BUT GIVEN FREEDOM TO ROAM, THEIR LEGACY WILL FROM THE PLACE WHERE YELLOWSTONE, THE WORLD'S IT'S RARE TO HAVE SUCH AND IT'S ANOTHER REASON BUT WHILE WOLVES AND BEARS ICONIC SYMBOLS OF THIS PLACE, THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER ANIMALS THAT MAKE YELLOWSTONE THE PARK IS HOME TO MORE THAN THE NEXT &quot;EPIC YELLOWSTONE&quot; SHOWING THE PARK FROM
