The Salvation was here, and it had been discovered [Music] Utah is not exactly the first the place you breakthrough. Let's be honest here, your mind day Saints. The state was founded by the searched for a promised land to make federal government for decades before they were only after the church publicly disavowed throughout the 20th century Utah as a state craved The state spent years building up their image as Their national parks and ski resorts attract have made their premiere there at Sundance.

It was something supposedly department had been working on something for got wind of it when they submitted a funding Rossi had read it, but the implications didn't night. The first thing he the next morning was "Are you building a bomb?" And the answer he got way." It was not, in fact, a bomb. But Washington lab in which this discovery had taken place had desperate to get as much data as possible before trustee meetings where everything was locked allowed to use the actual words to describe "the F-word". Although secrecy was of the utmost to the Governor of Utah in late 1988 and told On March 13th, 1989 the school filed its first Peterson called an emergency meeting with all and the lawyers were in agreement.

Splitting the atom. releasing a massive amount of energy. So much to an explosion so immense it could flatten a city of the 20th century. But its sibling, fusion, is we divide by the amount of mass used for fuel, All the atoms around you are made up of protons a positive charge, and neutrons with none.

But there is a barrier you enough heat, enough pressure, you can get the dominates. The strong nuclear force. At small force, and the two protons fuse together.

Of course, that all changed the early history of their cold fusion project that they were inspired during a hike in Millcreek frantically writing down calculations &gt;&gt; Should we tell the truth? &gt;&gt; Yeah &gt;&gt; It was in one of our Jack Daniels phases. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Narrator: According to Fleischmann, their convo to one chance, shall we do it?" to which Pons long career meant he was familiar with dozens work with palladium. Palladium is a decently amounts of hydrogen. It was almost like a metal as 1948. A palladium lattice can absorb about as and as it fills up it also expands increase dramatically. This effect is the same if thinking was that you could load a palladium compress the atoms so tightly, that some of them at room temperature. A colleague at Southampton as early as 1974, but it wasn't until he went willing to try it out with him. In order to load following set up. They take a battery, and hook it palladium. Next, they submerge this into a giant this is heavy water, D20. The hydrogen is replaced it makes up only about 0.0156% of the Earth's their hands on. Next, they dissolved some lithium and they plan to run electricity through the the heavy water molecules, D20, are split apart and deuterium. The oxygen is negatively and the deuterium is positively charged and floats as a sponge, and absorbs the deuterium atoms. And with as much deuterium as physically possible, tell though? By measuring the temperature of the the amount of electricity pumped in, that would Although it takes some work to get, the oceans Certainly much more renewable than oil or natural experiment was not an entirely new idea, however. reliable way to produce helium. Following World so a reliable way to make it in a lab would be a with hydrogen, and saw some evidence of helium. been forgotten about for decades, largely because realized they had made a mistake. The helium they not produced via fusion. Of course, the neutron and so they wouldn't have known to use deuterium this work before, as he briefly overlapped at 1950s. And so, all these years later Fleischmann hydrogen for deuterium. Pons and Fleischmann said later come to regret. The first was calling The second, was claiming that the experiment was easy to reproduce. Fleischmann will later say He knew that by going public like this they were ever seen before. He thinks that Pons may not have retirement here, and could leave the field any day cold fusion will be just a paragraph among though is younger, and with children still in up-end his life. By the end of it he will be left &gt;&gt; We did it!

Hundreds of calls a day, from every walk offering congratulations. Pons got personal father of the hydrogen bomb, and Carlo Rubbia, with random people looking to invest, or cranks Fleischmann and his wife were quickly assigned they travelled. Soon, Pons had to change his home night. The attempt to capitalize on the phenomenon T Shirts.

What size were the palladium rods? How are Is the surface of the rod baked, etched, be loaded into the rods? How long did it Weeks? What current should you supply? Which electrolyte do you add to the water? All legitimate questions that could have a major was in the works, but only a select few people had to go on was a story that evolved The "meltdown". The meltdown is supposedly the that might suggest fusion. Exact dates for stretch back as early as late 1984 or early it would be the earliest possible time where but also late enough that both Pons and at Southampton and the University of Alberta. Any and the University of Utah. According to the electrode for seven entire months. And then one working in the lab, to adjust the current running left, and then returned hours later to check on 1cm cube of Palladium, which has a melting point are again, inconsistent. In some versions of the it was a mini explosion. In some versions Joey it. There is one detail that remains consistent inches big. At least one independent source, that he saw the hole the next day. Something had that it could not have been explained by any according to Pons and Fleischmann was And it was stories of this meltdown that this discovery was genuine, leading to there exists no official University records occurred. Fleischmann, years later, claimed that experiment shut down as a clear fire hazard. a particular point of fixation among scientists. it still implied them. A 1cm Palladium cube can calculate how much energy would be necessary. would soon be working backwards from what dash to uncover as much information as possible. faxes of rough drawings and calculations sent footage of Pons holding one of his cells guess at the dimensions of the cell. There are to crack their way into Pons' personal email, of interest. Back then the internet was still that yet. But universities and research labs were making cold fusion one of the first ever hosted daily news updates, and information was Very few people were able to speak save for a few of their close friends.

Where this gets a couple weeks before the announcement, Pons had an editor at the journal.
