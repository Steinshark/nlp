You are disgusting and you buy from the uses clothes store. How could you hurt me like this? Sweetheart, I buy my clothes from brands shops. Is it alright if I sit with you girls? Of course not, with these disgusting clothes you can't sit with us. You will make us losers, go! I am sorry, sweetheart, give me the plate , your mother did not pay the tuition this months, take this free sandwich. Oh my God, such an awkward situation! I couldn't imagine being in your place. You are so poor that you eat this meal. I would never eat it. Thank God, my sandwich is a blessing and I am content with it. Oh poor thing! You know, my lunch is prepared by my private chef. Me too. -Let's eat girls. Poor thing dropped her coin, do you want it? Yes I want it, for the bus. You ride the bus? I have my private driver to take me. May Allah forgive you, thank God for the blessing of the bus. You are so poor, why do you come to school? So that I could learn and be smart to teach everyone. My luxurious car is here come on look at it. I would have taken you with me in my car but I'm afraid you would make it dirty. Bye! Shame on them bullying me because I am poor. Let me go buy some used clothes. God! This dress is so beautiful, it is amazing. It is cheap, I will buy it. Look where you are going! Sorry, it was a mistake, it was a mistake. You again! You buy from the used clothes shop! Yes, I do buy from the used clothes shop, it is all right there's nothing wrong with that. Sweetheart, I buy my clothes from the brand store. These are my abilities and I thank God for them. You are disgusting and you buy from the uses clothes store. Beautiful and clean used clothes. Your situation is very sad. You have no food in the school, you ride the bus and you also buy your clothes from the used clothes shop, you are very poor! How could you hurt me like this? Alright, bye bye. You poor girl! I can't believe you are saying this. Because she is a beggar. Shame on you. How could she call me a beggar! Ghazel, you have made the girl upset, shame on you. Mom, this girl goes to our school and everyone makes fun of her because she is a beggar. Don't be like that, I did not raise you like this. You have to respect everyone whether they are poor or rich. Mom, she makes me angry. Imagine if you were in her situation and everyone made fun of you, wouldn't that make you upset? Mom, no one makes fun of me because I am rich. Even if you were born in a rich family never look down on people you have to be humble. I don't care mom. In that case give me your phone and your brand clothes. From now on you will no longer ride luxurious cars, you will have to go on public transportation. You will eat from the school cafeteria, you will no longer wear branded clothes and you will only wear used clothes. Mom, no! That is it, I will not accept any discussion. Such a girl! Hello girls. What happened to you? Are you poor? Get away from here you are no longer our friend. Get away from our table. I feel what poor girl feels when they make fun of her. I have to buy from used clothes now. You buy from used clothes you are disgusting! Bagger! Enjoy your food broke girl. Let's go before anyone sees us. Let's go. I feel ashamed for what I did to Shfa, shame on me. May Allah forgive me, I will never make fun of poor people again. Shfa! Yes it's me Shfa, don't be upset to Ghazel, I will sit with you. Shfa, I am sorry I was rude to you. My whole attitude with you was wrong, forgive me. I forgive you my sweetheart Ghazel. Shfa, I didn't know how you felt in the past but now I do. Never mind them Ghazel, have self-confidence. Ghazel, these girls were never your true friends. If they were your true friends they would have stayed with you even if you were poor. You are right Shfa, they are friends of benefits. What do you say we go to the bus together? And we will go to the used clothes shop together. That's a great idea. Let's wait for the bus. Okay. What are you doing? We are waiting for the public transportation. Okay, we will go in our private car. I would have taken you with us but I'm afraid you would make it dirty. Shame on you, don't be so arrogant! Bye! May Allah guide them. The bus is here! Let's go. This is my daughter, Shfa! My name is Selma.
