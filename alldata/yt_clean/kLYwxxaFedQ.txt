Here grab a seat, I'll get you a plate. (kitchen closet door squeakily opens) - How do you get the wolves in the cages? - Shoot them with a tranquilizer gun, least favorite part of the job. - What's your favorite part? - Probably being alone out there. Listening to them call back - I saw one today. - How close where you? - It was like here to the sink. He had a collar on. - Where? - Like off the road. - Which road? - I have no idea. (paper rustling) - Here we are, did you take a - Left. - How far did you walk? - About two hours maybe, found one of the woods about an hour in. - Probably in Lamar valley, I'll bet that wolf you saw Here's Druid Peak, most of the packs are named after landmarks. - How many packs are there? - 13 now, but forming a It doesn't happen very often. I'll get us some water. In the early 1900's predator eradication was the official government policy. (water running) They shot every wolf they could find. Killed the last one here and declared the country wolf-free. Druids were part of the first animals from British Columbia, Six of those animals took to Survivors. You know I was in the I ever came as close to You may think the world hasn't Owen, but you're wrong. (faint clock ticking) (knocks on door) Just a sec.

Oh, you want something for those? Come on, come with me. I'm Jillian by the way, Must've covered some distance. - Yeah I guess, I (mumbling). - What were you looking for? - Wolves. - Wolves are elusive by nature, they are some of the toughest - I saw one yesterday, looked right at me. - You must have a wolf soul, your dad has a wolf soul. - What's with those collars? - They're radio collars. What kind of advice did Everett - Uhm, he told me to look for - (laughingly) Of course he did, that's what he told me Everett thinks if you you don't learn at all. (Jillian laughs) Come with me. (Owen sighs) (door opens) Ok, hold that, and hit that power switch. (static) So the packs are all on and the individuals are We try to call out about in every pack.

That's a wolf on the move. Alright he can be up to - That's a pretty big - Well... (paper rustling) Sit. So when you pick up your first signal, you mark that point on the map, and then you hike about a until you pickup the signal again and then you mark that point too. Where the two points Of course, by the time you get Wolves travels twice as fast as humans. Really we never know where they are, we just know where they've been. - [Owen] Why don't you exactly where they are? - Smart boy, GPS. They're too expensive. Anyway, your dad is not wrong. If you take one of these receivers out, and get yourself in the the skills that your dad was you'll see your wolves. Here. - What happened to the wolf in there? The skull by your desk. - Got shot by a rancher they - Why? - They think they kill their livestock. - Do they? - Yeah, sometimes. A lot of other things kill livestock too, particularly disease. It's a lot easier to blame a wolf than it is a bacterial infection. (plate scraping) Easier to blame something you can see than something you can't. - That's what my mom says. - What's that? - She says it is easier that are outside you than Where were you guys in the picture? - What picture? - Oh the picture my mom gave me. It's of the two of you on a bed somewhere. - I don't remember. (dishes being moved) (water running) (softly) Oh man...

(door opens and light switch flicks) (light switch flicks) - [Everett] These are not to take away anything from but our job as scientists isn't just to see it's to understand. To look for patterns in Don't just watch, observe. Now we know a lot about wolves but we still have a lot to learn. And that's true of every species on earth. It's even true about ourselves Owen.
