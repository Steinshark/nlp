HI, I'M RICK STEVES, BACK WITH THIS TIME, MY TWO FAVORITE CITIES BATH AND YORK. THANKS FOR JOINING US. YORK FEELS MORE MEDIEVAL, BOTH TOWNS GO BACK EACH TOWN IS PACKED WITH THAN CITIES THEIR SIZE DESERVE. AND EACH ARE ABOUT TWO HOURS IF YOU'RE LOOKING WITHOUT THE EXPENSE HEAD FOR BATH AND YORK -- IN BATH, WE'LL EXPLORE IMMERSE OURSELVES AND CRUISE THE CANALS. THEN WE ZIP OVER TO YORK, WHERE WE'LL MARVEL AT ENGLAND'S FINEST GOTHIC CHURCH, RAMBLE YORK'S WONDERFULLY MEET THE MORRIS DANCERS, THE ISLAND OF GREAT BRITAIN INCLUDES FROM LONDON, BATH IS AND YORK IS JUST TO THE NORTH. 250 YEARS AGO, BATH WAS THE TREND-SETTING IF EVER A TOWN ENJOYED LOOKING AND ITS NARCISSISM IS JUSTIFIED. LOCALS BRAG THAT THEY HAVE OR PROTECTED, THAN ANY OTHER TOWN IN ENGLAND. THE ENTIRE CITY, BUILT CALLED &quot;BATH STONE,&quot; BEAMS IN ITS COVER-GIRL AN ARCHITECTURAL CHORUS LINE, IT'S A TRIUMPH OF PROUD LOCALS REMIND VISITORS THAT THE TOWN FROM THE &quot;BRITAIN IN BLOOM&quot; TO GIVE OTHER TOWNS EVEN WITH ITS MOBS 2 MILLION A YEAR -- GOOD-LOOKING TOWNS ARE NOT RARE, BUT FEW COMBINE BEAUTY AS WELL AS BATH. VISITORS HAVE BEEN ENJOYING BATH EVEN BEFORE THE ROMANS ARRIVED THE PLACE WAS FOR THE ANCIENT ROMANS, THE TOWN'S IMPORTANCE CARRIED THROUGH THE MIDDLE AGES, THE RELIGIOUS CAPITAL IN 973, KING EDGAR -- CALLED WAS CROWNED RIGHT HERE. LATER, BATH PROSPERED WITH THE MONEY IT MADE FROM WOOL, BATH BUILT THIS CHURCH -- MEDIEVAL CHURCH IS 500 YEARS OLD. THE ABBEY'S FACADE FEATURES A VERY LITERAL WITH ANGELS GOING UP... AND DOWN. THE INTERIOR FEATURES AND IS LIT WITH ENOUGH STAINED GLASS &quot;LANTERN OF THE WEST.&quot; WITH ITS BROAD WINDOWS IT'S A FINE EXAMPLE BATH'S HEYDAY PASSED, AND BY THE MIDDLE OF THE 1600s, HAD DROPPED JUST A HUDDLE OF HUTS ITS RESIDENTS THAT THEIR SMELLY MUD WAS COVERING UP THE RUINS OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN SPA. THEN, IN 1687, AN ENGLISH QUEEN CAME HERE AND BATHED. WITHIN ABOUT 10 MONTHS, SOON AFTER THAT, QUEEN ANNE WITH ALL THIS ROYAL INTEREST, BATH THE SPA TOWN THE REVITALIZED TOWN MOST OF THE BUILDINGS YOU'LL SEE LOCAL ARCHITECTS WERE INSPIRED ANDREA PALLADIO, TO BUILD A &quot;NEW ROME.&quot; THE TOWN BOOMED, NOT WITH SCRAWNY SIDEWALKS, BUT WITH BROAD &quot;PARADES,&quot; UPON WHICH AND WOMEN COULD SPREAD THIS IS THE ROYAL CRESCENT. DATING FROM THE 1770s, THESE ARE THE FIRST &quot;GEORGIAN&quot; IS BRITISH AS YOU CRUISE THE CRESCENT, IMAGINE YOU'RE ONE WHAT APPEARS TO BE IS ACTUALLY AN OPTICAL TRICK. THE HIDDEN WALL, KEEPS SHEEP WITHOUT CREATING AN EYESORE. THE GEORGIAN HOUSE, &quot;NUMBER ONE, ROYAL CRESCENT,&quot; GIVES AN INTIMATE PEEK INTO THE LAVISH LIFESTYLES VOLUNTEERS IN EACH ROOM ON ALL THE FASCINATING DETAILS. Woman: GEORGIAN LADIES WERE NOT FASHIONS AS WE WOULD BECAUSE IF THEY WERE THEY WOULD WEAR THE FRENCH WIGS. AND THEY DIDN'T START SO THIS HAIR HERE THAT MEANT YOUR EYEBROWS THEY HAD TO BE SHAVED OFF, AND THEN YOU HAD LITTLE STUCK ON Steves: AND THE KITCHEN THE LATEST GEORGIAN GIZMOS. SO WHAT IS THIS IS A TURN-SPIT, THE DOG WAS BRED HE WENT IN FOR TWO HOURS, AND THEN ANOTHER DOG UNTIL THE JOINT OF MEAT SO HE SPINS THE MEAT? YES. AND IF HE STOPS WALKING, &quot;I'M GOING WELL, FIRST OF ALL, AND THEN, LAST RESORT -- SHOVEL A COAL IN THERE -- HOT COALS, HE RUNS. SO A NICE STEAK, YOU'VE YES, EXACTLY. A BLOCK AWAY IS ANOTHER FINE BIT CALLED &quot;THE CIRCUS.&quot; IT FEELS LIKE A COLOSSEUM ITS DORIC, IONIC, AND CORINTHIAN PAY HOMAGE SERVANTS LIVED IN ATTIC ROOMS JUST BELOW ONE FOR EACH HEATED ROOM. THE ANCIENT ROMAN BATHS ARE THE TOWN'S HIGH SOCIETY HERE TO ROMAN TIMES, ENJOYED THE MINERAL SPRINGS FROM LONDINIUM, ROMANS TRAVELED AS THE CITY WAS CALLED, EVENTUALLY, THE NAME THIS ANCIENT ROMAN POOL IS STILL NINE TONS OF IT. YOU CAN ALMOST IMAGINE LOUNGING AROUND, SCHMOOZING, JUST LIKE THEY DID TODAY, A FINE MUSEUM ROMAN ARTIFACTS AND THE REMAINS EVOKE A SOPHISTICATED CITY. THE HOT THERMAL WATER AS IT HAS PAST ANCIENT ENJOY SOME QUALITY TIME LOOKING GODDESS OF THE HOT SPRINGS. AFTER ROME FELL THESE OLD POOLS SILTED UP, AND BATH WAS FORGOTTEN AS A SPA. OVER A THOUSAND YEARS LATER, WHEN THOSE ENGLISH QUEENS AND BELIEVED THAT ITS CURATIVE BECOME PREGNANT WORD OF ITS WONDER WATERS AND BATH WAS BACK HIGH SOCIETY SOON INTO ONE BIG PLEASURE PALACE. THE PUMP ROOM, JUST ABOVE THE ROMAN BATHS, OFFERS THE VISITOR'S BEST CHANCE IN THIS NEO-CLASSICAL GRANDEUR. DROP BY FOR A FANCY, OR JUST SIP OK, SO BATH WATER? YES, THIS IS BATH WATER. GENERALLY THIS HAS GOT ABOUT 43 DIFFERENT MINERALS IN IT. THINGS LIKE ARSENIC, IT'S MADE OF VERY, VERY HIGH THIS WATER IS COMES TO A TEMPERATURE 116deg FAHRENHEIT, SO ABOUT 44deg AND WHAT DOES IT IS IT GOING TO MAKE ME GENERALLY, IT'LL CURE A NUMBER THINGS LIKE IF YOU'RE SUFFERING ANGINA. SO, MAINLY, IT'S -- A SORT OF PAINKILLER, IT TASTES BAD ENOUGH CHEERS! ABOVE IT ALL STANDS BATH'S &quot;MASTER OF CEREMONIES&quot; NASH WAS A ONE-MAN ORGANIZING THE DAILY REGIMEN SPIFFING UP THE CITY, BATH'S RELAXATION THEME ITS NATURAL THERMAL SPA IS ONCE AND TRANQUIL PARKS OFFER HERE IN THE PARADE GARDENS, ENTITLES YOU AND A PERFECT CHANCE TO SEE HOW SLOW BATH'S AVON RIVER OFFERS YOU CAN HOP A LITTLE CRUISE. OR, FOR MORE EXERCISE, YOU CAN THESE WATERWAYS WERE BUILT BUT TO SHIP COAL THE TOW PATHS -- ORIGINALLY BARGE-TUGGING HORSES -- ARE NOW POPULAR FOR HIKERS, AND DOGS OUT WALKING CANAL BOATERS ENJOY THEIR IDYLLIC CRUISES BY INDUSTRIAL-AGE LOCKS. WITH THE HELP OF THESE LOCKS, LAID-BACK VACATIONERS CAN CRUISE LOCKS ARE AND PASSERSBY ARE FOR THE PROPER BATH EXPERIENCE, I LIKE TO SLEEP OUR HOTEL COMES A BEDROOM THAT FITS RIGHT IN NEOCLASSICAL ARCHITECTURE AND AN ELEGANT BREAKFAST VERY HEARTY... AS WELL AS VERY HEALTHY. BATH EXPERTLY ENTERTAINS FREE TOWN WALKS ARE OFFERED BY THE MAYOR'S CORPS THESE VOLUNTEERS AMAZING GEORGIAN HERITAGE Man: DO YOU REMEMBER OF THE MAN WHO AND WHAT YOU GET A CIRCLE, AND YOU GET ALL SORTS SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THE NEW TOWN EXPLORING THIS OLD CLASSICAL, OR REINVENTING THIS OLD IS WHAT THE NEW Steves: TO ENJOY BATH'S IT DISPLAYS 400 YEARS ONE FRILLY DECADE AT A TIME. WITH PROVIDED AUDIO GUIDES YOU CAN TRACK THE EVOLUTION RIGHT THOUGH THE AGES. IN ABOUT 1600, GLOVES MADE WITH WHITE GOAT SKIN, AND DESIGNED TO MAKE YOUR FINGERS LOOK MORE ELEGANT AND SLENDER IN THE 1740s, ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN TO SHOW OFF THEIR FABULOUSLY AND EXTRAVAGANTLY EMBROIDERED IN THE MID-1800s, WITH SMALLER &quot;UNDER STRUCTURES.&quot; THOSE WIDE HOOPS EVOLVED WITH THE OUTBREAK DESIGNERS MADE DRESSES YET PRACTICAL, STYLISH, YET SIMPLE. BATH'S MUSEUM OF COSTUME BATH WAS NOT ALL THERE'S A GRITTIER SIDE LIKE THE REST OF ENGLAND, THE STORY HERE WAS THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. AT THE MUSEUM OF BATH AT WORK, VOLUNTEERS SHOW OFF OF THE INGENIOUS MR. BOWLER. THIS IS DATING ALL THESE MACHINES STEAM-DRIVEN. AND WITH A SET THERE WAS VIRTUALLY THAT HE COULDN'T TACKLE. PEOPLE IN THE TOWN MR. BOWLER WOULD ABSOLUTELY. Steves: AND MR. BOWLER OF THE LOCAL WATERS, TOO. HE BOTTLED HIS OWN FIZZY WATER. RIGHT, THIS IS WHERE HE SO SODA POP WAS ONE ABSOLUTELY, YES. AND IT WAS FILLED ON THIS RATHER INGENIOUS MACHINE AND ALL YOU DID -- YOU ROTATED THAT AND THERE YOU GO. WOW! THERE YOU ARE. MR. BOWLER'S THAT'S RIGHT. BATH IS DRENCHED IN HISTORY. AND A GREAT WAY TO LEARN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THAT IS TO JOIN THE BIZARRE EACH EVENING THROUGH THE SUMMER, LOCAL ACTORS GIVE VISITORS A GOOFY AND IMMENSELY DOSE OF STREET THEATER. Man: WELL, WE'RE GOING BECAUSE...WELL, IT'S THE MOST WALKING AND AT THIS STAGE THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING FOR THOSE OF YOU HERE'S A QUICK JOKE FOR YOU, [ LAUGHTER ] AS THIS STAGE, HOW TO BE ACCEPTED BECAUSE THIS IS A LOCAL BYLAW, A LOCAL REGULATION THAT ONE HAS TO HOP [ LAUGHTER ] IF LOCAL PEOPLE ACROSS THE ROAD, YOU'RE A LOCAL PERSON AND THEY SMILE AT YOU THEY REALLY DO. OVER, OVER YOU GO. OVER YOU GO, THAT'S GOOD. OVER YOU GO. [ LAUGHTER ] NEXT WE'RE HEADING AND EQUALLY ENTERTAINING IT'S JUST A COUPLE HOURS NORTH BRITAIN'S TRAINS ARE SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE PER MILE HOWEVER, ASSUMING YOU'RE THEY'RE FAST, FREQUENT, YORK OFFERS OF GREAT SIGHTS MIXED WITH AN EASYGOING ALL LASSOED WITHIN ITS RICH HISTORY GOES BACK THIS COLUMN IS A SCANT REMINDER OF WHEN YORK WAS THE NORTHERNMOST CITY CONSTANTINE WAS ACTUALLY IN THE YEAR 306. LATER, IN THE 5th CENTURY, THE EMPEROR SENT A LETTER AS THIS PART OF THE EMPIRE AND HE SAID, BASICALLY, WHEN ROME PULLED OUT, AND YORK BECAME THE CAPITAL THE VIKINGS LATER TOOK THE TOWN, AND FROM THE 9th IT WAS A THRIVING DANISH THEN CAME THE NORMANS. MEDIEVAL YORK GREW RICH WITH 9,000 INHABITANTS, IT BECAME ENGLAND'S HENRY VIII USED THE CITY'S AS HIS ANGLICAN CHURCH'S THE MINSTER IS BRITAIN'S LARGEST GOTHIC CHURCH BRILLIANTLY SHOWS THAT THE LATE THE YORK MINSTER IS FILLED ITS GRAND BELLS HAVE CALLED FOR WELL OVER A THOUSAND YEARS. EACH DAY AT NOON THE HUGE BELL IS RUNG FROM THE CHURCH TOWER. AT 10 TONS, THE BELL CAN [ BELL RINGS ] INSIDE, YOUR FIRST IMPRESSION THE SPACIOUSNESS AND BRIGHTNESS. THE NAVE, FROM ABOUT 1300, IS ONE OF THE WIDEST ON FESTIVAL SUNDAYS, 4,000 THE CENTRAL TOWER SOARS THE NECK-SAVING MIRROR ALLOWS THE CHURCH HAS MORE THAN THE REST OF ENGLAND'S THE EAST WINDOW IS THE SIZE THE GREAT WEST WINDOW HAS WITH ITS NICKNAME, IT REPRESENTS THE SACRED HEART AND REMINDS WORSHIPPERS THE INTRICACY OF THE PAINTED HELD TOGETHER BY LEAD THE FINE DETAILS, FAR TOO TINY ARE SAID TO BE THE CHOIR SCREEN SEPARATES THIS ORNATE WALL WITH FOUR CENTURIES FROM WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WHILE MOST OF THE FACES WITH THE SAME HENRY, DURING WHOSE REIGN IS BOTH GENTEEL AND ENGAGED. YORK'S MINSTER NUMBER-TWO ANGLICAN CHURCH, THE ANGLICAN CHURCH CAME INTO BORN OUT OF EUROPE'S LONG BETWEEN POPES AND KINGS. ENGLAND'S SPLIT WITH THE VATICAN HENRY WANTED TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE THE POPE SAID NO. HENRY DID ANYWAY, THAT HE, AND NOT THE POPE, WAS THE HEAD WHILE HENRY CONSIDERED HIMSELF JUST NOT A ROMAN CATHOLIC, HIS CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE ESSENCE CANON JEREMY FLETCHER HOW ANGLICANISM DIFFERS HENRY THE VIII'S ARCHBISHOP AND HE DEFINED THREE PILLARS SCRIPTURE AND REASON THE BIBLE, AND THE TRADITION AND THAT'S BETWEEN THE NEW AND THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH THAT THE MEDIEVAL WAS MUCH LESS BASED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IT'S A PROTESTANT CHURCH. BUT THE STRUCTURES REMAINED CATHOLIC ONES AS WELL, SO IT HAS BOTH. WE LIKE AS BEING CATHOLIC Steves: YORK'S MIGHTY WALL THAT THE CITY WAS MORE IT WAS A MILITARY VITAL FOR THE CONTROL FROM ROMAN TIMES THESE RAMPARTS, ON THE REMAINS ARE MOSTLY MEDIEVAL -- EACH OF THE TOWN GATES WAS AND I IMAGINE PRETTY SCARY GAZE UP AT THE TOWER, BEHIND THE CROSS-SHAPED KEEP AN EYE ON THOSE WITH THEIR STONES TO PROTECT THEIR TOWN. TODAY THOSE WALLS SEEM ONLY TO PROTECT YE OLDE DOWNTOWN YORK -- AS CAR-FREE TODAY IS FILLED WITH CHARACTERISTIC IT FEELS MADE PEOPLE-WATCHING, YORK'S RICH HISTORY THE RUINS OF ST. MARY'S ABBEY -- ONCE THE WEALTHIEST ABBEY ARE LOCATED IN A LUSH IN HIS FIGHT HENRY VIII SAW THE WEALTHY AS BOTH A THREAT TO HIS RULE IN WHAT'S CALLED HE DISSOLVED HE TOOK THEIR MONEY AND THE YORKSHIRE MUSEUM -- ACTUALLY BUILT INTO THE RUINS TELLS THE STORY OF LIFE HERE HOW ALL THAT ENDED, THE ANCIENT ROMAN COLLECTION FROM CULT FIGURINES TO THE SKULL OF A MAN KILLED BY A SWORD BLOW MAKING IT GRAPHICALLY CLEAR THAT THE STRUGGLE BETWEEN WAS A VIOLENT ONE. THIS FINE 8th-CENTURY SHOWS A BIT OF BARBARIAN AND THOSE VIKINGS -- THEY WORE AND ACTUALLY COMBED THEIR HAIR. THE MIDDLEHAM JEWEL, AN EXQUISITELY ETCHED IS CONSIDERED THE FINEST PIECE TO THE NOBLE LADY WHO WORE THIS IT BOTH HELPED HER WORSHIP THE BACK OF IT, SHOWS THE NATIVITY. THE FRONT SHOWS THE HOLY TRINITY WHICH PEOPLE BELIEVED TOP PRIORITY WITH GOD. FOR A LIVELY CHANGE OF PACE, LOOK FOR THE LOCAL WHO BOLDLY KEEP CENTURIES OF DANCING TRADITION ALIVE. MIXING BOTH PAGAN THEY'RE ALWAYS CHEERLEADING THE TOWN THROUGH THE RETURN OF SPRING, YOUR MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY...
