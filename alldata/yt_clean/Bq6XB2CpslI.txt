I THINK YOUR HAIR'S GONNA BE NICE. MISS KESHA ALWAYS DOES A GOOD JOB. SHE DOES. SHE HOOKS US UP EVERY TIME. Ling: MOST DAYS, LIFE FOR SISTERS PAIGE AND SABLE SEEMS NO DIFFERENT THAN YOUR AVERAGE TWENTY-SOMETHINGS. PAIGE IS EARNING HER MASTER'S DEGREE IN EDUCATION. [ Singsongy ] LOVE IT! [ SINGS INDISTINCTLY ] SABLE'S ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED. BUT ON FRIDAY NIGHTS, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. [ SCREAMING, PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] Man: LET IT GO, LET IT GO, LET IT GO, LET IT GO! Man: OH, MY GOD, SHE ABOUT TO TAKE THE ROOF OFF OF IT. COME ON! Ling: PAIGE AND SABLE ARE MEMBERS OF A CHURCH THAT CLAIMS IT CAN CAST OUT DEMONS. IN THE NAME OF... IN THE NAME OF JESUS! [ WOMAN SCREAMS ] IT'S A RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT CALLED &quot;DELIVERANCE MINISTRY.&quot; [ WOMAN SPEAKS IN TONGUES ] IT'S THE KINGDOM OF SATAN VERSUS THE KINGDOM OF GOD. THIS IS WAR. [ Amplified voice ] SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT. COME OUT OF THERE! COME OUT! Ling: TONIGHT, I'M MEETING PEOPLE UNITED IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE DEVIL. NO! YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT. NO! WE'LL BIND YOU. Ling: A BORN-AGAIN PASTOR... THE BLOOD. Ling: A CHRISTIAN COUNSELOR... SO I COMMAND THAT SPIRIT TO GO. Ling: AND THOSE WHO SAY DELIVERANCE HAS SAVED THEM, BODY AND SOUL. DELIVERANCE GIVE YOU THE POWER TO FIGHT. WITHOUT THAT, I'D BE DEAD TODAY. THESE DEMONS -- THEY DON'T BELONG IN ME. THEY BELONG IN THE PIT OF HELL. Ling: AMERICA -- IT CAN BE INSPIRING AND BEAUTIFUL. IT CAN ALSO BE DARK AND UGLY. IT'S SO MANY THINGS... BUT IT'S OURS. IT'S &quot;OUR AMERICA.&quot; -- Captions by VITAC -- www.vitac.com CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS IN DISTANCE ] [ BARKING ] ON A BURNED-OUT LOT IN RURAL WEST GEORGIA, FAYETTE IS UNDER SIEGE. IT'S BEEN HARD 'CAUSE I HAD TO FIGHT EVERY DAY. SOMETIME I FEEL LIKE I LIVE IN HELL. Ling: WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS LAID OFF FOUR YEARS AGO, THE FAMILY LOST THEIR HOUSE IN ATLANTA AND MOVED TO THE BACK COUNTRY. [ CHILD SHOUTS IN DISTANCE ] ALL RIGHT, BABY. Ling: FOR 39-YEAR-OLD FAYETTE, RAISED IN THE CITY, IT'S A LONELY LIFE, AND MEMORIES OF A GRIM CHILDHOOD HAVE COME BACK TO HAUNT HER. TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOUR LIFE WAS LIKE WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] I WAS...MENTALLY ABUSED, PHYSICALLY ABUSED. MY DAD WAS REAL MEAN. MY MOTHER WAS, TOO. THERE WAS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT IT. Ling: FAYETTE BLUNTED THE TRAUMA OF HER PAST WITH DRUGS AND SEX. BY THE TIME SHE TURNED 16, SHE WAS A MOTHER OF 2. TODAY, SHE'S RAISING 6 KIDS IN A 4-ROOM TRAILER. AND AS IF THINGS WEREN'T CROWDED ENOUGH, FAYETTE SENSES ANOTHER PRESENCE LURKING. Fayette: THEY WAKE YOU UP OUT YOUR SLEEP. YOU CAN FEEL 'EM SITTING ON THE BED NEXT TO YOU. WALKING THROUGH THE HOUSE, JUST CAN FEEL SOME PUSHING DOWN. THEY TELL YOU HOW TO KILL YOURSELF. YOU CAN HEAR IT SAY, &quot;DO IT, DO IT, DO IT.&quot; Ling: FAYETTE SAYS HER SUFFERING HAS OPENED A SPIRITUAL DOOR TO DEMONS. THEY OPPRESS HER EMOTIONS, AND EVEN WORSE, SHE BELIEVES THEY TAKE CONTROL OF HER OWN KIDS. [ CHILD SCREAMS ] Fayette: THEY GET IN YOUR CHILDREN. I CAN SEE IT IN THEIR EYES. SOMETIME I WAKE UP WITH A DEPRESSION ALL OVER ME. IT'S LIKE A WITCH CONTROLLING YOU. Ling: IS IT SCARY? YES. BUT WHEN THE BURDEN GET SO HEAVY THAT I CAN'T FIGHT IT MYSELF, I KNOW WHERE TO GO. I GO TO PASTOR BATTLE. Ling: FOR PASTOR FRANKLIN BATTLE, EVERY DAY IS WAR. IN HIS MARVELOUS NAMES... Ling: BEFORE DAWN, SIX DAYS A WEEK, HE KISSES MADELYN, HIS WIFE OF 40 YEARS, GOODBYE... MWAH. LOVE YOU, CAP'N. HAVE A GOOD DAY. MMM! ...AND HEADS OUT TO THE FRONT LINES. WE ARE IN A FIGHT. IF YOU COME TO A FIGHT WITHOUT THE FIGHT IN YOU, THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOSE, AND I HAVE NO BONE IN ME AT ALL THAT WANTS TO LOSE ANYTHING. Ling: PASTOR BATTLE WAS RAISED BAPTIST, GREW UP WATCHING TELEVANGELIST SERMONS, AND ACCEPTED CHRIST AS HIS SAVIOR AT AGE 4, BECOMING WHAT'S KNOWN AS &quot;BORN AGAIN.&quot; THAT'S ABOUT THE TIME, HE SAYS, THAT GOD STARTED TALKING TO HIM. IN THE MID-'70s, THE LORD STARTED GIVING ME DREAMS AND VISIONS OF FIGHTING WITH DEMONIC SPIRITS. I WAS CALLED TO BE A PASTOR IN 1995. THE LORD TOLD ME THAT &quot;I WANT YOU TO START A CHURCH.&quot; Ling: PASTOR BATTLE HEEDED GOD'S CALLING, AND 20 YEARS AGO, HE STARTED THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH. [ Amplified voice ] HALLELUJAH! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] HALLELUJAH! [ SHOUTING AND CHEERING ] MY GOD, COME ON, SHOUT! Ling: PASTOR BATTLE AND HIS CONGREGANTS ARE NON-DENOMINATIONAL BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIANS. THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, WHO ENDOWS THEM WITH THE POWER TO PERFORM MIRACLES, PROPHESIZE, AND SPEAK IN TONGUES. HALLELUJAH! AND ON FRIDAY NIGHTS, PASTOR BATTLE USES THESE GIFTS TO TAKE ON HIS GREATEST ADVERSARY -- SATAN. ARE YOU READY?! THOSE OF US WHO ARE BORN AGAIN BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY IN THE NAME OF JESUS TO COMMAND DEMONIC SPIRITS TO LEAVE A PERSON, AND THEY HAVE TO OBEY US BECAUSE WE SPEAK ON THE AUTHORITY OF JESUS HIMSELF. KNOW THAT THIS DAY, I AM THE LORD. Ling: PASTOR BATTLE'S CHURCH PRACTICES DELIVERANCE, THE CASTING OUT OF DEMONS. IN THE NAME OF JESUS! [ SOBBING ] THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PLAGUED BY SORT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DEMONS... MM-HMM. OR EMOTIONAL DEMONS, BUT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LITERAL DEMONS. ABSOLUTELY. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD OPENS OUR SPIRITUAL EYES TO ALLOW US TO SEE DEMONS. THEY CAN TALK. THEY CAN REASON. THEY'RE VERY SMART. THEY'RE INTELLECTUAL. THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A BODY. Ling: NOT EVERY BORN-AGAIN CHURCH OFFERS DELIVERANCE, AND THERE ARE NO HARD NUMBERS ON HOW MANY DO. BUT EXPERTS SAY THERE COULD BE THOUSANDS NATIONWIDE. PASTOR BATTLE OFFERS DELIVERANCE FREE OF CHARGE TO HIS CONGREGANTS, AND TODAY, FAYETTE HAS DRIVEN 70 MILES TO SEEK HIS HELP. SO WHAT BRINGS YOU IN TO US TODAY? GET SOME DELIVERANCE. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM AREAS THAT YOU'VE BEEN UNDER ATTACK IN, WOULD YOU SAY? I CAN'T...ADAPT WITH LIFE. WHAT IS REALLY DRIVING THAT ATTACK ON YOU? JUST BEING ALONE ALL THE TIME. MM-HMM. AT WHAT AGE CAN YOU REMEMBER -- HOW FAR DOES IT GO BACK? ABOUT 6. DID ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU AT 6 YEARS OLD? WELL, MY PARENTS JUST LEFT ME. MM. Ling: AT FIRST, THIS FEELS LIKE AN ORDINARY COUNSELING SESSION. BUT I'M SOON REMINDED THAT IN THIS HOUSE OF GOD, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO FIGHT DARKNESS. I THINK THAT REJECTION'S A REAL GOOD PLACE TO START LOOKING FOR DEMONIC SPIRITS. THAT'S REALLY CAUSING YOU TO BECOME UNSTABLE. SO REPEAT AFTER ME. SAY, &quot;LORD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS...&quot; LORD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS... I REPENT... I REPENT... FOR EVERY SIN THAT I'VE COMMITTED. FOR EVERY SIN I'VE COMMITTED. I RENOUNCE SATAN... I RENOUNCE SATAN... AND EVERY DEMONIC SPIRIT. WHAT'S GOING ON? [ GRUNTS ] I BIND YOU. [ GRUNTS ] I BIND YOU. NO! I BIND YOU. NO! I BIND YOU! [ Shrieks ] NO! YOU WILL! TURN HER LOOSE! TURN HER LOOSE! NO! YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT. NO! YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT. NO! YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT! NO! THE BLOOD OF JESUS. [ GRUNTING ] COME OUT OF THERE NOW. COME OUT OF THERE NOW! NO! I REBUKE YOU! I REBUKE YOU! Woman: OUT OF THERE. I REBUKE YOU! TURN HER LOOSE. BY THE BLOOD OF JESUS, YOU BETTER TURN HER LOOSE RIGHT NOW. OUT OF THERE. COME ON. [ SHRIEKS ] WHAT IS YOUR NAME? AAH! WHAT'S YOUR NAME? [ SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] SPEAK IN ENGLISH. SPEAK IN ENGLISH. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? [ CONTINUES SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] SPEAK IN ENGLISH. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER? [ SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] I LEAD HER. I LEAD HER. I LEAD HER TO HER END! LEAD HER TO WHAT? TO THE END! END OF WHAT? HER LIFE! WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS OF EXCISING A DEMON FROM SOMEONE. WE'LL BEGIN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE DEMONIC SPIRIT INSIDE, BECAUSE THE SPIRIT CAN ACTUALLY TALK OUT OF THAT PERSON'S MOUTH. THAT'S WHAT WE CALL &quot;MANIFESTATION.&quot; OH! TAKE HIS POWER AWAY. YOU ARE NOT THERE LEGALLY. [ SPEAKING IN TONGUES ] BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DEDICATE HER TO YOU. WHAT DO YOU DO TO HER? EVIL? I RUN HER MIND. YOU RUN HER MIND. YES. WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO THERE? UHH! BURN HIM AGAIN AND BREAK HIS WILL DOWN. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AND COVERED IN THE BLOOD OF JESUS, WE BREAK THE CURSE. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN STAY. LET'S GO NOW. [ COUGHING ] Ling: PARTWAY THROUGH THE SESSION, FAYETTE STARTS COUGHING. PASTOR BATTLE SAYS THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE PROCESS. IF YOU LOOK AT DEMONIC SPIRITS AS BEING SPIRITS OF AIR, HOW DO WE GET AIR OUT OF OUR BODIES? THROUGH BREATHS OR STRONG COUGHS FROM YOUR STOMACH. [ COUGHS ] FORCE, MEET FORCE. DON'T YOU TAKE ALL DAY. LET'S GO. OUT NOW. Ling: TODAY'S 2-HOUR ORDEAL IS NOTHING NEW FOR FAYETTE. IN THE 12 YEARS SHE'S BEEN COMING TO THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH, SHE'S GONE THROUGH DELIVERANCE DOZENS OF TIMES. IF HE LYING, GET THE FIRE HOT. Ling: ACCORDING TO PASTOR BATTLE, DEMONS CAN INFECT US IN UNTOLD NUMBERS, AND GETTING FREE OF ALL OF THEM CAN TAKE A LIFETIME OF DELIVERANCE. HALLELUJAH. SO YOU'RE BACK. YOU THINK THAT DID THE TRICK? OKAY, WELL, LET'S FILL THOSE AREAS UP. FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR FORGIVING HER, CLEANSING HER, AND SETTING HER FREE. WE ASK YOU TO JUST SEAL THOSE AREAS, LORD, WITH THE BLOOD OF JESUS. WE THANK YOU AND WE PRAISE YOU. AMEN. AMEN. ALL RIGHT! WHOO! [ CLAPPING ] SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE DEMONS HAVE LEFT YOUR BODY NOW? SOME OF THEM. WHAT'D IT FEEL LIKE? ONCE YOU GET DELIVERANCE, YOU FEEL FREE. AND THE MORE YOU GET, THE BETTER YOU ARE. THAT WAS A GOOD FIGHT THAT WE WON. Fayette: I PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE NOW IF IT WASN'T FOR PASTOR BATTLE. GIVE ME A WILL TO KEEP GOING AND TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT YOU. IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE OF YOU. Ling: FAYETTE HAS NEVER HAD PSYCHOTHERAPY. SHE SAYS SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT, AND SHE'S CONFIDENT DELIVERANCE IS ALL SHE NEEDS. BUT I'M LEFT WITH MANY QUESTIONS. FATHER, WE THANK YOU THAT YOU HAVE BROUGHT US TOGETHER TODAY. Ling: WHERE DID DELIVERANCE MINISTRY COME FROM? IS IT JUST A TEMPORARY FIX? EVERY MORNING WHEN I WAKE... Ling: OR COULD IT OFFER A SHOT AT GENUINE TRANSFORMATION? CAN CHANGE Ling: I'M IN ATLANTA TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINS OF A DRAMATIC RITUAL PRACTICED BY MANY BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIANS -- THE CASTING OUT OF DEMONS. FOR ANSWERS, I'M MEETING DR. MICHAEL KUNIO, A SOCIOLOGIST AND EXPERT ON AMERICAN DELIVERANCE MINISTRIES. CAN YOU DEFINE WHAT DELIVERANCE IS? DELIVERANCE IS A FORM OF EXORCISM. EXORCISM IS A VERY SOLEMN RITUAL WHERE A PERSON HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY POSSESSED BY A DEMON, WHEREAS DELIVERANCE IS A RATHER LESS FORMAL PROCEDURE FOR ELIMINATING DEMONS WHICH CAUSE ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS. PERHAPS THEY'RE NOT, UM, ABSOLUTELY POSSESSING ME, BUT THEY'RE INTERFERING WITH MY LIFE, AND I NEED SPIRITUAL HELP. BUT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, MICHAEL? IT'S...VERY...UNUSUAL TO WATCH. [ CHUCKLES ] JUST IMAGINE. YOU BELIEVE THAT, SOMEHOW, YOU HAVE MADE YOURSELF VULNERABLE TO DEMONS. YOU WANT TO GET CURED. THE RITUAL TAKES PLACE. IT IS THE MOST INTOXICATING RITUAL IMAGINABLE, BUT YOU ARE ALSO IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTIBILITY. YOU KNOW, BY VIRTUE OF OTHER DELIVERANCES YOU HAVE ATTENDED, THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN WAYS THAT YOU'RE EXPECTED TO BEHAVE WHILE YOU ARE GETTING YOUR DEMONS DELIVERED. AND SO WHAT WE VERY OFTEN HAVE IN DELIVERANCE ARE PEOPLE DOING WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THEM. Ling: CHRISTIAN BELIEF IN SATANIC ATTACK IS AS OLD AS THE BIBLE. SCRIPTURE DESCRIBES JESUS CASTING DEMONS OUT OF THE POSSESSED. BUT MODERN DELIVERANCE MINISTRY BEGAN IN THE 1900s, WHEN A SMALL BORN-AGAIN CONGREGATION IN CALIFORNIA REBELLED AGAINST THE AUSTERITY OF TRADITIONAL WORSHIP AND SET OFF AN ECSTATIC RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT CALLED PENTECOSTALISM. IT WAS A HIGHLY EXUBERANT FAITH, WITH MUSIC, WITH MARCHING, WITH SHOUTING &quot;HALLELUJAHs&quot; AND &quot;AMENs,&quot; AND WHAT FREQUENTLY WAS A PART OF THE PENTECOSTAL MOVEMENT WAS DELIVERANCE -- EXPELLING DEMONS. THEY SAY JESUS HIMSELF PRACTICED DELIVERANCE. WE ARE ACTUALLY IMITATING THE EARLY MINISTRY OF JESUS HIMSELF. Ling: OTHER DENOMINATIONS SOON FOLLOWED PENTECOSTALISM'S LEAD, AND CHURCHES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BEGAN PRACTICING DELIVERANCE. UNLIKE CATHOLIC EXORCISTS, THOSE WHO MINISTER DELIVERANCE SAY ANY BORN-AGAIN BELIEVER CAN LEARN TO EXPEL DEMONS. GOOD EVENING, CLASS. Congregants: GOOD EVENING. HOW ARE WE DOING TODAY? Woman: GREAT. ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S MAKE SOME NOISE. ALL RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] I WANT YOU TO REALLY FOCUS ON TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE GIFTS THAT YOU HAVE. Ling: TONIGHT, PASTOR FRANKLIN BATTLE MENTORS HIS MOST PROMISING STUDENTS. EVERYTHING WE DO, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, IS REALLY ENGAGING THE DARK SIDE. IT'S ENGAGING THE ENEMY. THEIR AIM IS TO NEUTRALIZE WHAT YOU'RE BRINGING TO THE TABLE. WE DON'T HAVE TO GET NERVOUS JUST BECAUSE SATAN OR A DEMON SHOWS UP. WORK ON IT. THE MORE EXPERIENCE YOU GET, THE MORE SETTLED YOU WILL BECOME. AMEN? LIKE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SCARED OF SATAN. &quot;WELL, HE'S SO CREEPY. HE'S SO SCARY.&quot; BUT HERE, WE'RE TALK -- YOU CAN BIND THE DEVIL, AND HE HAS TO DO WHAT YOU SAY. Woman: COME ON. YOU GONNA COME OUT OF THERE NOW. Ling: 26-YEAR-OLD SABLE HAS BEEN STUDYING THE ART OF CASTING OUT DEMONS FOR JUST TWO MONTHS, BUT SHE'S ALREADY GETTING THE HANG OF IT. DELIVERANCE IS JUST SO POWERFUL. YOU FEEL SO BEATEN DOWN, BASED ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES OR THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU. IN THE NAME OF JESUS... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] Sable: YOU'RE ONCE TAKEN CAPTIVE BY SATAN, BUT NOW YOU HAVE AUTHORITY OVER HIM. Ling: SABLE AND HER 25-YEAR-OLD SISTER, PAIGE, ARE FAITHFUL MEMBERS OF THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH, AND BOTH OF THEM ARE RECOVERING FROM A PAINFUL PAST. THE SISTERS HAD DIFFERENT FATHERS, WHO BOTH PASSED AWAY WHEN THE GIRLS WERE KIDS, LEAVING THEIR MOM VANESSA ON HER OWN, STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET AS A SCHOOLTEACHER. I THINK A LOT OF HER ANGER CAME FROM JUST OUR DADS NOT BEING THERE. CAN YOU TELL US SOME OF THE THINGS THAT SHE SAID TO YOU WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE GIRLS? JUST FLAT-OUT, &quot;YOU'RE UGLY.&quot; OR YOU ARE -- JUST LIKE, &quot;YOU'RE NOTHING,&quot; &quot;I WISH I WEREN'T HERE.&quot; IT'S -- YOU KNOW, &quot;IT'S Y'ALL FAULT THAT, YOU KNOW, US STRUGGLING.&quot; &quot;I WISH I WOULD HAVE ABORTED YOU.&quot; [ Crying ] LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU SAY SOMETHING... [ SNIFFLES ] DO YOU THINK, IN A WAY, YOU TOOK THAT STRESS, UM, AND FRUSTRATION OUT ON THE KIDS? YES, I DID. I LOVE MY CHILDREN, BUT I WAS VERY ANGRY. SOMETHING I SAID THAT I WOULD NEVER DO IS HAVE CHILDREN AS A SINGLE PARENT. I'M LIKE, &quot;GOD, YOU HAVE PUNISHED ME. I GOT TO RAISE THEM BY MYSELF.&quot; Ling: THROUGH THEIR TEENS AND 20s, THEIR MOTHER'S VERBAL ABUSE HAUNTED THE SISTERS AND BRED LOW SELF-ESTEEM AND DEPRESSION. IN COLLEGE, PAIGE AND SABLE BOTH BECAME BORN AGAIN, AND SABLE TRIED SECULAR COUNSELING, BUT NOTHING EASED THE TORMENT... MY GOD, COME ON AND LET THE LORD KNOW YOU'RE GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE HOUSE. ...UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN SABLE ACCOMPANIED A FRIEND TO A MEETING WITH PASTOR BATTLE. I WAS A BELIEVER AFTER THAT BECAUSE -- INSTANTLY? INSTANTLY, I WAS A BELIEVER AFTER THAT. I TOLD PAIGE, I WAS -- [ LAUGHS ] I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID. I WAS LIKE, &quot;PAIGE, UM, I'VE STARTED GOING TO THIS CHURCH...&quot; YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] AND, UM... [ LAUGHS ] AND THEY DO DELIVERANCE. SO WHEN I GOT THERE, I WAS SCARED, LIKE, BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT. AND THEN NEXT THING I KNOW, I WAS ON THE FLOOR, COUGHING AND SCREAMING AND ACTING CRAZY. [ LAUGHS ] I REALLY HAVE STUFF INSIDE OF ME THAT NEEDS TO COME OUT. Vanessa: MAY I PLEASE GO SIT DOWN? OH, YEAH, MOM, YOU'RE GOOD NOW. WE APPRECIATE YOU. Ling: NOW, PAIGE AND SABLE GET DELIVERANCE NEARLY EVERY WEEK AND SAY IT'S HELPED THEM START TALKING TO THEIR MOM ABOUT THE PAST. THE FAMILY'S WORKING ON GETTING CLOSER, BUT VANESSA, A LIFELONG BAPTIST, IS STILL SKEPTICAL OF HER DAUGHTERS' CHURCH. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS DELIVERANCE BUSINESS THAT YOUR TWO DAUGHTERS ARE INVOLVED WITH? I... [ LAUGHS ] NEVER KNEW A CHURCH LIKE THAT EXISTED. DELIVERANCE, WHEN THEY SAY CASTING DEMONS... [ CHUCKLES ] WHAT? THESE ARE SOME REAL NUTS. SHE JUST WENT BANANAS, LIKE, SHE JUST COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. LIKE, AT ONE POINT, SHE SAID, &quot;ARE Y'ALL IN A CULT? WHAT IS THIS?&quot; AND IT'S IN JESUS' NAME WE PRAY, AMEN. AMEN. AMEN. Ling: BUT DESPITE HER RESERVATIONS, VANESSA'S AGREED TO COME TO THIS FRIDAY'S SPIRITUAL WARFARE SESSION. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN? WITH MY MOM, IT'S LIKE THE PAST 23 YEARS WITH HER HAS BEEN DYSFUNCTIONAL. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT JUST COMING AND BEING SET FREE ONE TIME. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A WILLING HEART AND WANT TO CHANGE AND BE FREE AT THE END OF THE DAY. Ling: DELIVERANCE PROMISES FREEDOM, BUT ONLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE READY FOR IT -- SOMETHING 30-YEAR-OLD KENNETH IS ALSO ABOUT TO LEARN. Ling: KENNETH STARTED RUNNING YOUNG. THE SON OF AN ARMY SERGEANT, HE PUSHED BACK ON HIS FAMILY'S RULES. AT 15, HE LEFT HOME FOR A LIFE ON THE STREETS. Kenneth: SMOKING WEED, SNORTING POWDER, SELLING DRUGS, SLEEPING IN HALLWAYS, ABANDONED APARTMENTS. I REALLY JUST DIDN'T HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. Ling: FOR YEARS, KENNETH WAS IN AND OUT OF JAIL ON CHARGES OF BATTERY AND DRUG POSSESSION. AT 24, HE LANDED IN PRISON ON A PROBATION VIOLATION. HE MOVED BACK IN WITH HIS PARENTS A MONTH AGO, AND HE'S STRUGGLING TO GET BACK ON HIS FEET. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO FIND AN APARTMENT, BECAUSE THEY DON'T ACCEPT PEOPLE WITH DRUG FELONIES. I'M TRYING TO GO TO TRUCK DRIVING SCHOOL. WITH A FELONY, PERIOD, I GOT TO WAIT 10 YEARS BEFORE I CAN DRIVE TRUCKS. I'M IN A HOLE, AND I KEEP TRYING TO SHAKE THE DUST OFF OF ME, BUT IT AIN'T WORKING. Pastor Battle: [ Amplified voice ] HELLO? JUST AT YOUR WORD! Ling: BUT KENNETH MIGHT HAVE AN UNCONVENTIONAL OPTION. LOOK AT VERSE NUMBER 5. Ling: THREE YEARS AGO, HE DROPPED IN ON A SERVICE AT THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH. BACK THEN, HE WASN'T READY FOR PASTOR BATTLE'S CONFRONTATIONAL STYLE. THAT'S -- THAT'S -- THAT'S YOUR TOUCH TODAY. Ling: BUT SINCE HE MOVED BACK HOME, THE DEMONS ARE BACK IN FORCE. LONELINESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER. THAT'S A LOT OF DEMONS. YEAH, I COULD PROBABLY KEEP GOING, TOO. FOR SOME REASON, I JUST FEEL LIKE GOD IS GONNA PULL ME OUT OF ALL THIS AND DELIVER ME FROM ALL THE STUFF THAT I'M GOING THROUGH. [ SNAPS FINGERS, PATTING RHYTHMICALLY ] [ Rapping ] SEE, I STAY PRAYED UP 'CAUSE I MESS UP ALL THE TIME STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT UP, I AIN'T LYIN', STRAIGHT UP [ CHUCKLES ] I LIKE THAT. YEAH. &quot;TOTALLY HUMBLE UNDER GOD.&quot; I LIKE THAT. YES, MA'AM. Ling: FOR KENNETH, A NEW PATH MAY BE REVEALED. THIS FRIDAY, PASTOR BATTLE IS PERFORMING HIS WEEKLY MASS DELIVERANCE. IT WILL BE KENNETH'S FIRST. AND IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, ANOTHER BORN-AGAIN BELIEVER IS FAST APPROACHING HER OWN SPIRITUAL CROSSROADS. I COMMAND HIM TO GO IN JESUS' MIGHTY NAME. Ling: PENTECOSTALISM SPREAD ITS PASSION FOR FIGHTING SATAN TO CHRISTIANS NATIONWIDE. YOU MAY ALWAYS DO IT Ling: AND IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, 39-YEAR-OLD JELLY IS ABOUT TO FACE DOWN HER OWN DEVILS. YOU REALLY DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE THOSE DEMONS IN YOU. SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE GIVE THEM THE PERMISSION TO COME INVADE YOUR LIFE BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DO TO YOU. [ Amplified voice ] I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, YOU HAVE BEEN HURT. JESUS HIMSELF SAID, &quot;IN THIS WORLD, &quot;YOU WILL SUFFER MUCH TRIBULATION. BUT BE OF GOOD CHEER; I'VE OVERCOME ALL OF THEM.&quot; Ling: LIKE THE CONGREGANTS OF THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH, JELLY AND HER 18-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, JARRIE, ARE BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIANS. THEY BELIEVE IMMORAL BEHAVIOR CAN OPEN THE DOOR TO SATAN. BUT IT WASN'T JELLY'S SIN THAT LET THE DEMONS INTO HER LIFE. I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED BY MY MATERNAL GRANDFATHER. I WAS 6 WHEN IT STARTED. IT WENT ON FOR YEARS. AND I'VE GROWN UP WITH A LOT OF SHAME. WHEN I EXPECTED PEOPLE TO BE THERE FOR ME, PEOPLE TO PROTECT ME, BE IT MOM, DAD, TEACHERS, THEY WOULDN'T FOLLOW THROUGH. Ling: JELLY SAYS THE YEARS OF UNCHECKED ABUSE LEFT EMOTIONAL SCARS AND INFECTED HER WITH A DEMONIC SPIRIT IN HER FAMILY'S PUERTO RICAN BLOODLINE, KNOWN AS &quot;JEZEBEL.&quot; THE JEZEBEL SPIRIT IS VERY...SENSUAL. SHE PLAYED A LOT ON MY PHYSICAL FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS -- HOW CUTE I LOOKED IN A DRESS, HOW PRETTY MY HAIR IS, HOW MY MAKEUP WAS DONE. AND BECAUSE I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED IN MY CHILDHOOD, I ALWAYS RELATED, UM, SEX WITH LOVE. SO IF I WASN'T HAVING SEX, I WASN'T FEELING LOVED. Ling: JELLY STRUGGLED WITH PROMISCUITY AND WENT THROUGH A STRING OF DEAD-END RELATIONSHIPS. BUT LIFE TOOK ON A NEW PURPOSE WHEN SHE GAVE BIRTH TO HER DAUGHTER JARRIE. THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY KEPT ME GOING THROUGHOUT ALL THESE YEARS WAS MY DAUGHTER. I DON'T WANT HER TO GO THROUGH EVERYTHING THAT I'VE GONE THROUGH IN MY LIFE. NO. I WANT HER TO -- NOW, TO GROW UP, FREE ALREADY. IF I'M FREE, IT'S AUTOMATICALLY GONNA TRICKLE DOWN TO HER, BECAUSE SHE'S PART OF ME. Ling: TODAY, JELLY'S A PARALEGAL AND SINGLE MOM, ABOUT TO PUT JARRIE THROUGH COLLEGE. BUT THE DEMONS LINGER. AND WHILE HER CHURCH DOESN'T OFFER ON-SITE DELIVERANCE, TWO MONTHS AGO, THEY REFERRED HER TO SOMEONE WHO DOES. THEY PLAYED THE ANNOUNCEMENTS ONE SUNDAY MORNING IN CHURCH, AND IT SAID, &quot;DO YOU WANT TO BE FREE?&quot; AND I WAS LIKE, YEAH! [ LAUGHS ] I WANT TO BE FREE OF A LOT OF THINGS. Ling: THE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS FOR ABOVE &amp; BEYOND, AN OFFICE OF TRAINED CHRISTIAN COUNSELORS WHO USE DELIVERANCE IN THEIR TREATMENT FOR ABOUT THE SAME COST AS SECULAR COUNSELING. IN JESUS' MIGHTY NAME. WHY NOT SEEK REGULAR THERAPY, RATHER THAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS? I DID SEEK REGULAR THERAPY, AND...IT HELPED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BUT IT DIDN'T GET RID OF THE PAIN. I WANT TO GET RID OF IT FROM THE ROOT, AND DOING WHAT I'M GONNA BE DOING -- THAT'S MY ONLY SOLUTION. I BELIEVE THAT MY GOD IS CAPABLE IS DOING ANYTHING, AS LONG AS YOU GIVE HIM THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO IN YOUR LIFE, AND HE KNOWS THAT I'M READY TO DO WHAT IT TAKES. Ling: ABOVE &amp; BEYOND IS ONE OF THOUSANDS OF CHRISTIAN COUNSELING CENTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY. I'M HOPING JELLY'S COUNSELOR, PHYLLIS, CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON THEIR APPROACH TO DEMONS. JELLY WAS ABUSED WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG. HOW DOES ABUSE SOMETIMES OPEN THE DOOR FOR DEMONS TO ENTER THE PERSON? THOSE SPIRITS CAN GO BACK AND FORTH, SO IF SHE WAS ABUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAD A SPIRIT OF LUST AS A SMALL CHILD, UM, THEN THAT SPIRIT OF PERVERSION THROUGH LUST WOULD COME INTO HER. AND YOU CAN HELP GET RID OF THOSE DEMONS. YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JELLY WILL NOTICE, TOO, IS THAT SHE'LL BE FREE FROM THAT. Ling: UNLIKE THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH, ABOVE &amp; BEYOND SAYS IT COULD TAKE JUST ONE SESSION TO END THE TORMENT. BUT WILL JELLY BE ABLE TO CONFRONT HER DECADES-OLD DEMONS? Jelly: COMING FACE-TO-FACE WITH YOUR OWN DEVILS -- THAT'S WHAT'S SCARY. BUT WHAT YOU BRING TO LIGHT LOSES ITS POWER, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE. Ling: IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF TAMPA, JELLY IS PREPARING FOR HER FIRST INDIVIDUAL DELIVERANCE SESSION TO EXCISE THE JEZEBEL SPIRIT SHE BELIEVES ENTERED HER WHEN SHE WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED AS A CHILD. YOU CAN'T HEAL SOMETHING UNLESS YOU OPEN IT UP AND TAKE THAT CRAP OUT OF IT. I WENT TO THE PSYCHIATRISTS, AND THEY HELPED ME TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, BUT I WANT IT GONE COMPLETELY, LIKE IF IT NEVER HAPPENED, AND THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO THAT IS GOD. YOU READY? YES. WE'RE GOING TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN THE HALL TO THE END. Ling: TODAY, CHRISTIAN COUNSELOR PHYLLIS IS LEADING JELLY'S DELIVERANCE WITH HER COLLEAGUE, CORRINE, OFFERING SUPPORTIVE PRAYER AND SPIRITUAL INSIGHTS. WE'LL BREAK THE GENERATIONAL CURSES, WORD CURSES, ANYTHING THAT COULD HAVE COME DOWN THROUGH YOUR BLOODLINE THAT ALLOWED ANY SPIRITUAL TORMENT IN. DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK, ALL RIGHT? IN JESUS' MIGHTY NAME, JUST COVER YOU NOW. Ling: THIS IS A WORLD AWAY FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AT THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH. THERE'S NO COUGHING OR WRITHING -- JUST PHYLLIS FIRMLY COMMANDING JELLY'S DEMONS TO LEAVE HER IN PEACE. ALL GENERATIONAL SPIRITS AND JEZEBEL IN CONTROL, I BREAK YOUR POWER NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, YOU GO. Ling: THROUGH PRAYER, PHYLLIS WORKS TO BREAK THE CURSE OF THE JEZEBEL SPIRIT. I CANCEL THE ASSIGNMENT OF VANITY. I CANCEL EVERYTHING THAT CAME IN WITH ACCUSATION AND SCORN. Ling: ...AND EVERY OTHER KIND OF TORMENT JELLY MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCED. ANY RITUAL THAT WAS PERFORMED WITH SANTERIA, I BREAK THE POWER OF THOSE CURSES RIGHT NOW. Ling: ...UNTIL SHE GETS TO THE ROOT. EVERY SPIRIT OF FEAR THAT CAME IN WITH VICTIMIZATION, EVERYTHING THAT CAME IN WITH FEAR OF A PREDATOR OR AN ABUSER, EVERY SPIRIT OF FEAR THAT CAME IN WITH HOLDING HER DOWN, IT GOES. I CANCEL YOUR ASSIGNMENT OFF OF HER CHEST RIGHT NOW, IN THE NAME OF JESUS, YOU GO. I CANCEL THE LITTLE GIRL'S SPIRIT OF HIDING THAT LOCKED HER IN A ROOM. I BREAK YOUR POWER OFF OF HER RIGHT NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. I BREAK THE POWER, THAT SPIRIT OF ISOLATION LINKED WITH HIDING. IT GOES. Jelly: GOD IS A GENTLEMAN. HE'S NOT GONNA HEAL YOU UNLESS YOU GIVE HIM THE PERMISSION TO DO SO. AND THEN HE LITERALLY TAKES YOU BACK TO THAT MOMENT WHEN THAT ABUSE HAPPENED. IN JESUS' NAME. JUST GET A LITTLE, A PICTURE OF, UM -- IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LITTLE SHACK OF SOME SORT, AND THAT LITTLE GIRL IN THE SHACK. MM. AND, UM, THAT, UM, IT'S NOT JUST HIDING. IT'S THE LONELINESS. OH, OKAY. [ Whispers ] THANK YOU, LORD. THANK YOU LORD. [ CRYING ] THE SPIRIT OF LONELINESS GOES WITH THAT SPIRIT OF ISOLATION. I COMMAND YOU UP AND OUT, RIGHT NOW, IN THE NAME OF JESUS. ALL LONELINESS GOES. EVERY ROOT, CORD, AND TENTACLE OF THAT SPIRIT OF LONELINESS, I COMMAND IT TO RELEASE JELLY NOW. IN THE NAME OF JESUS, IT GOES. [ SOBBING ] IN THE NAME OF JESUS. IN JESUS' NAME. [ CONTINUES SOBBING ] IN THE NAME OF JESUS. IN THE NAME OF JESUS -- JUST KEEP LOOKING AT ME, JELLY. I COMMAND THOSE SPIRITS TO GO IN THE NAME OF JESUS. [ Whispering ] THANK YOU, LORD. THANK YOU, LORD. [ CRIES ] IT'S OKAY. [ CONTINUES CRYING ] THANK YOU, LORD. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ Whispering ] THANK YOU, LORD. THANK YOU, JESUS. [ Normal voice ] YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT HURT. YEAH. I THANK YOU, LORD, THAT YOU HAVE DELIVERED HER FROM THE VIOLENT MAN. CAN YOU SPEAK THAT ONE OUT WITH ME? I COMMAND... [ EXHALING AND SNIFFLING ] [ CONTINUES EXHALING AND SNIFFLING ] I COMMAND... EVERY SPIRIT... EVERY SPIRIT... TO RELEASE ME NOW... TO RELEASE ME NOW... IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. AMEN. AMEN. THANK YOU, LORD. THANK YOU, JESUS. [ LAUGHS ] OH. THANK YOU. [ Whispers ] YOU'RE SO WELCOME. [ SIGHS ] Ling: IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN JUST HOW THIS EXPERIENCE WILL CHANGE JELLY'S LIFE. BUT BACK IN ATLANTA, AN ARMY OF BELIEVERS IS GATHERING FOR THEIR OWN SHOWDOWN WITH THE DARK SIDE. Man: THANK YOU, LORD! Ling: IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT, AND A STORM'S BREWING IN ATLANTA. IN LESS THAN AN HOUR, PASTOR FRANKLIN BATTLE'S WEEKLY MASS DELIVERANCE BEGINS. HI THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UH-HUH. Ling: PASTOR BATTLE'S MINISTRY IS GROWING SO FAST, THAT FROM TIME TO TIME, THEY HAVE TO USE SANCTUARIES IN BIGGER CHURCHES. SO EVERYTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START FILING IN SOON, AND THE PROCESS OF DEMONIC EXPULSION WILL BEGIN. BEFORE HE TAKES ON THE DEVIL, BATTLE PRAYS, FORTIFYING HIMSELF FOR THE FIGHT AHEAD. SCRIPTURE TELL US ALWAYS PUT ON WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER MILITARY PERSON WOULD PUT THEIR ARMOR ON BEFORE THEY GO INTO BATTLE. WE DO THE SAME THING. OURS IS JUST SPIRITUAL. [ Amplified voice ] LET YOUR GLORY FILL THIS PLACE Ling: IN THE SANCTUARY, I SPOT SISTERS PAIGE AND SABLE. THEY'VE BROUGHT THEIR MOTHER VANESSA TO SEE IF SHE'LL BE INSPIRED BY PASTOR BATTLE. AND KENNETH'S ALSO HERE, ATTENDING THIS GROUP DELIVERANCE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THEY'RE READY. THEY'RE WAITING ON YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] Man: HALLELUJAH! [ CHEERING ] COME ON, GIVE HIM PRAISE AND GIVE HIM SOME GLORY. HE'S THE LORD OF THE HOUSE. [ CHEERING ] OH, MY GOD, MY GOD, MY GOD. WHOO! [ CHEERING CONTINUES ] THANK YOU, LORD! THE DEVIL IS WINNING. OUR JOB IS TO WRESTLE AGAINST THE FORCES OF DARKNESS. LUKE, CHAPTER 10 -- DEMONIC SPIRITS ARE SUBJECT TO YOU IN THE AUTHORITY THAT JESUS GAVE YOU. HE GAVE YOU UNBRIDLED AUTHORITY, UNHINDERED POWER, UNHINDERED ACCESS TO THE POWER. ALL THE POWER... Ling: TONIGHT, I CAN SEE THERE'S MORE TO THIS MINISTRY THAN JUST FIGHTING DEMONS. LORD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS... Congregants: LORD, IN THE NAME OF JESUS... I BREAK EVERY CURSE... I BREAK EVERY CURSE... AND REMIT EVERY SIN. Ling: ACCORDING TO DR. KUNIO, DELIVERANCE ALLOWS MANY BORN-AGAIN CHRISTIANS TO TRANSCEND THEIR DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES. Kunio: ONE OF THE GREAT APPEALS OF THE DELIVERANCE MOVEMENT IS THAT IT POINTS TO A REALM, A SUPERNATURAL REALM BEYOND THE HUMDRUM BANALITY OF EVERYDAY EXISTENCE. WE'RE ABLE TO DO BATTLE WITH EVIL SPIRITS IN THIS REALM. WE'RE ABLE TO ENLIST THE SUPPORT OF GOD AND GOD'S ANGELS. NO DEMONIC SPIRITS HAVE ANY RIGHT, NOR POWER, TO OPERATE IN MY LIFE. Kunio: IMAGINE THE ALLURE OF THIS. WE'RE THE ONES WHO ARE POWERED BY THE SPIRIT TO DO THINGS THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD EVER DO. HOW MANY OF Y'ALL CAME TO GET SET FREE TONIGHT? FATHER, WE THANK YOU FOR DELIVERANCE. WE ASK THAT YOU WILL SEND FORTH THE ANGELS NECESSARY, IN NUMBER, RANK, AND POWER, TO DESTROY THE WORKS OF THE DEMONIC. AND WE BIND EVERY DEMONIC SPIRIT OF ANGER THAT'S OPERATING IN THE PEOPLE OF GOD, AND WE COMMAND YOU TO COME OUT OF THERE NOW. COME OUT, ANGER. [ CONGREGANTS COUGHING ] WE REBUKE YOU. ALL THE WAY OUT. COME ON OUT OF THERE. THE BLOOD OF JESUS. COME ON OUT OF THERE. LET'S WORK, LADIES. LET'S GO TO WORK, LET'S GO TO WORK. ALL THE WAY OUT. COME ON OUT OF THERE. COME ON. YOU GOT TO FIGHT REAL HARD TO BE FREE. COME OUT OF THERE, THE SPIRIT OF MYSTICISM! COME OUT NOW! IN THE NAME OF JESUS, LET THEM GO! COME ON UP OUT OF THERE! THE BLOOD -- LET HIM GO! THE BLOOD OF JESUS! COME OUT OF THERE! COME OUT OF THERE! THE BLOOD -- COME OUT. GET ON UP OUT OF THERE! COME OUT OF THERE, SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT. LET IT GO RIGHT NOW. LET IT GO. RELIGIOUS SPIRIT, COME OUT OF THERE. MOVE! LET IT GO RIGHT NOW! COME ON OUT OF THERE! COME OUT OF THERE! COME OUT OF THERE, REJECTION! COME ON, VANESSA! LET'S GO TO WORK. LET'S DRIVE 'EM OUT. Ling: I'M NOT SURE IF THE DELIVERANCE PROCESS IS CATCHING ON WITH VANESSA... Pastor Battle: LET IT GO, LET IT GO. BUT PAIGE AND SABLE ARE EXPERIENCING INTENSE MANIFESTATIONS. [ SCREAMING ] COME ON OUT OF THERE, HATRED FOR MEN. [ SOBBING ] HATRED FOR MEN, COME OUT OF THERE NOW! COME ON OUT OF THERE, ANGER. ANGER WITH THE MOTHER, COME OUT NOW, IN JESUS' NAME. COME OUT OF THERE, ANGER WITH THE MOTHER, ANGER WITH THE FATHER. [ CLANGING ] [ SOBBING ] Pastor Battle: FATHER, LET THE RESIDUE PASS, AND LET THE CLEANSING HAPPEN NOW IN THE NAME OF JESUS. Ling: BY 11:00 P.M., THE WARFARE WINDS DOWN, LEAVING MANY CONGREGANTS PROFOUNDLY MOVED. I'M TIRED. BUT I FEEL A LOT FREE, LIKE A LOT FREE, LIKE MY HEAD FEELS CLEAR. I JUST FEEL BETTER THAN I DID BEFORE I CAME HERE. [ COUGHS ] Ling: BOTH OF YOUR DAUGHTERS WERE COUGHING PROFUSELY IN THE BAGS AND SORT OF FLAILING THEMSELVES ON THE GROUND. WHAT WERE YOU THINKING WHEN THAT WAS HAPPENING? IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES FOR THEM TO GET CLOSER TO GOD AND GET RID OF ALL THOSE DEMONS THAT THEY HAVE INSIDE OF THEM, THEY ARE WHO THEY ARE. THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT THROUGH GOD, NOT ME. BUT WHATEVER GOD IS STORING WITH THEM, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS BETTER, SO I WAS AT PEACE. Ling: VANESSA MIGHT NOT HAVE EXPERIENCED DELIVERANCE AS DEEPLY AS HER DAUGHTERS, BUT PASTOR BATTLE MAY HAVE FOUND AT LEAST ONE NEW CONVERT -- KENNETH. AT FIRST, IT FELT WEIRD, LIKE, WHAT IS HE HANDING US TRASH BAGS FOR? [ LAUGHS ] Ling: TONIGHT'S EXPERIENCE HAS HAD AN IMPACT, AND SOON, KENNETH WILL TAKE HIS FIGHT WITH THE DEVIL ONE STEP FURTHER. Ling: THREE DAYS AGO, KENNETH WENT THROUGH A GROUP DELIVERANCE SESSION AT THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH. OH, BOY. SO, WHAT WE DEALING WITH? Ling: NOW HE'S PICKING UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF IN A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING WITH PASTOR BATTLE. ALL MY TIME, I'VE BEEN IN THE STREET FROM 15 TO NOW. I GUESS WHEN I LEFT, I WANTED TO BE THE MAN SO BAD, THE REASON WHY I LEFT HOME. MM-HMM. AND MY DAD'S, LIKE, REAL STRICT ON ME, STILL. MM-HMM. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? OH, QUITE SURE. [ CHUCKLES ] AND IT'S LIKE, I SAY, &quot;YOU AIN'T GOT NO FAITH IN ME.&quot; I ALWAYS FELT LIKE MY PARENTS TURNED THEY BACK ON ME. HOW MUCH IN YOU IS YOU BLAMING THEM FOR YOUR SITUATION? YOUR PARENTS? UH... THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY CAUSING YOU TO BE SO LOCKED DOWN THERE AND CONFUSED ON THE INSIDE. BEING HOMELESS AND ON DRUGS AND ALL -- IT'S WHAT YOUR CHOICE WAS. THEY DIDN'T CHOOSE THAT FOR YOU. SO YOU JUDGE YOUR PARENTS FOR, YOU KNOW, BEING THE REASON WHY YOU HAD TO LEAVE AND ALL THAT, BUT YOU ABANDONED THEM. THERE'S A LOT OF HUMBLING YOU GOT TO DO. GO BACK AND APOLOGIZE AND JUST MAKE UP. THE DEVIL OWNS A PART OF YOU. SO YOU READY TO FIGHT? AMEN. ALL RIGHT, WE BIND THOSE SPIRITS OF ANGER. WE COMMAND YOU TO TURN HIM LOOSE AND LET HIM GO NOW. COME ON OUT. REJECTION BY THE FATHER. [ COUGHS ] Ling: TODAY, KENNETH FACES DOWN THE DEMONS HE FEELS HAVE HELD HIM BACK IN LIFE. BUT ACCORDING TO PASTOR BATTLE, DELIVERANCE IS ONLY ONE PART OF A LARGER PROCESS OF CHANGE. LET IT GO NOW, LET IT GO NOW, LET IT GO NOW! Pastor Battle: WE CAST ALL THE DEMONS IN THE WORLD OUT OF YOU, BUT UNTIL YOU ARE RIGHT, IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. GO, YOU GOT TO FIGHT, KENNETH! [ SCREAMING ] YOU HAVE SELF-CONTROL. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! COME ON OUT! Pastor Battle: THE DEMONIC SPIRIT CANNOT OVERRIDE OUR WILL. THEY CAN ATTACK IT, THEY CAN HARASS IT, BUT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO, WE CAN DO GREATER THROUGH GOD. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ SIGHS ] NOW HOW YOU FEEL, SON? OOH, UH... YOU LOOK BETTER. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ CRYING ] AMEN. AMEN. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] AMEN. I JUST KNOW IT. [ CRYING ] [ GRUNTS ] SO GIVE YOUR OLD CHURCH DADDY A HUG. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU BEING WET. Ling: TWO MONTHS AFTER WE MET KENNETH, THINGS STARTED LOOKING UP. HE'S NOW HOLDING DOWN TWO JOBS AT LOCAL FACTORIES. OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN... Ling: MEANWHILE, PASTOR BATTLE'S PLANNING TO RELOCATE THE UPPER ROOM CHURCH TO A BIGGER, PERMANENT SPACE. HE SAYS THE MINISTRY IS BECOMING MORE POPULAR EVERY DAY... [ LAUGHTER ] ...AS BELIEVERS LIKE PAIGE AND SABLE SEEK OUT DELIVERANCE TO HEAL THEMSELVES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. OOH, I REMEMBER THIS. THIS SHIRT WAS FOURTH GRADE. SABLE, YOU HAD SOME ISSUES. I KNOW! MY BANG LOOKS ALL MESSED UP. [ LAUGHTER ] Ling: IT'S OBVIOUS THAT YOU'VE REALLY GROWN A LOT, BUT IS IT SOMETIMES HARD TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU'VE FELT AND EXPERIENCED WITH YOUR MOM NOW? IT WAS VERY HARD. I DO APPRECIATE MY MOM'S FIRMNESS, BUT I THINK THAT THE EMOTIONAL AND VERBAL ABUSE, IT JUST WASN'T NECESSARY AT ALL. IF I HAD TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN, THE CUSSING WOULD NOT -- DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BE A PART OF MY VOCABULARY. AND I PRAY THAT WHEN YOU ALL, YOU KNOW, GET MARRIED, HAVE CHILDREN... [ Voice breaking ] I WANT MY GRANDBABIES TO KNOW THEY GRANDMAMA. I DO. AND I WANT TO BE PART OF YOUR FAMILY. Ling: FOR NOW, VANESSA'S STICKING WITH HER TRADITIONAL BAPTIST CHURCH. BUT FOR SABLE AND PAIGE, ONGOING DELIVERANCE IS ESSENTIAL FOR FORGIVENESS AND HEALING. [ LAUGHTER ] [ GATE CREAKS ] Ling: BACK IN TAMPA, JELLY'S ALREADY FEELING THE FREEING EFFECTS OF HER DELIVERANCE. Jelly: I FEEL LIGHTER. I FEEL MORE PEACEFUL. I JUST KNOW IT -- IT WORKED. THEY'RE ALREADY GONE IN ONE -- IN ONE SESSION? YES, YEAH. BUT OF COURSE, I HAVE TO LIVE A LIFE, UH, FILLED WITH THE WORD, MAKING SURE THAT I DON'T LET THEM BACK IN. NOTHING IS INSTANT. AIN'T NO MICROWAVE SOLUTION FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF. BUT IT'S LIKE I'M SHUTTING THE DOOR FOR THEM TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO WREAK HAVOC IN MY LIFE. I BROKE IT...HERE. IT STOPPED WITH ME. Ling: PEOPLE MIGHT DEBATE WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVIL EXISTS, BUT DOES THAT REALLY MATTER IF DELIVERANCE BRINGS THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN IT ONE STEP CLOSER TO FREEDOM?
