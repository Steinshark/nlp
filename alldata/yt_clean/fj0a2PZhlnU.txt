Would an expensive toaster Let's talk about that. Good Mythical Morning. Toaster ovens are the greatest In fact, you usually put sliced bread inside a toaster oven... Ha. Think about that for a second. Wow. But these little countertop cooking forms for a huge variety of prices. So how are we supposed to know Probably by buying toaster ovens at the dishes that are made from them... It's time for the power of the price. Okay, behind you are three toaster ovens. On Rhett's side is our low price option, the Black and Decker extra In the middle is our high price option, Oster toaster. That's a point for rhyming. Yep. And on Link's side is our fancy option, Countertop Oven Elite for $599.95. Look at the handle on that thing. Good gracious. $600. And this one's like $132 you said? $192. Yeah. Dang. Okay. Almost. That's their slogan. $600. Wolf it down. And so I think that they make which has these red things, It's just aesthetic. Just aesthetic. So, minus a point. Well, they do something, Yeah, they do something. They adjust something when it's on. Clearly it's not just like... Yes, but they don't turn all the way around. You said they did nothing. I don't want the Wolf They don't do the thing that I which is turn all the way around. The legal department at Wolf... is intense. You turn, back thing to like roast, boil, Well, the Mythical Kitcheners have so you don't have to figure Too late. I figured it out. And this first round, they use the toast setting to cook You're looking for the one that you think was cooked in the fancy toaster. Okay. All right, we'll be the judge of that. Like, literally. Yeah, we're here, Rhett. All right. I've always wanted to say that. I mean, this first plate has the most... browned stuff. You might go as far as to call it what, Link? Burn. You think it. I don't think the toaster It's just got a burnt spot. Taste that right there. Tell me what it is. Taste that right there and Toaster strudel. It's a toaster strudel. You tell me what that is. Mm, Burnt. This is burnt. And this is a little bit burnt, too. That was bad. It's a little bit burnt. I don't mind a little bit burnt. If that one came from a $600 toaster, I'm gonna be having some words with Mr. Wolf Blitzer. Maybe undercooked. Yeah, you shouldn't draw that's one of the things little ruckus with them was about was. It was the Wolf Blitzer Wolf connection. Oh, really? I had a runner one time. This one's not my previous job. The other show I did. You had a runner? Yeah. What do you mean, a runner? Like a joke that I kept going back to. Okay. Oops. That was hard to hold onto. You were thinking about Stevie was there. Remember that show we did? I was shuddering at the fact that I already made in a previous job. It was on CNN. That disturbs me. It was a weird show because, every episode, No one was complaining about anything. You know, there wasn't as much gray hair. It was weird. It was. Yeah, yeah. This one's a little burnt too. It was the Rhett show on CNN. You don't remember it? None of these are great. I think I like my Pop Tarts unpopped. What does that even mean? Not burnt, they get burnt. The problem is when they Even the middle one. Well, do you notice any. I just don't notice any I just notice difference in how burnt it is. I feel like this one is the least cooked, so it has a more rubbery texture. The first one was just out. That was just a fail. Okay, you're gonna put your hand over from the most expensive option. In 3, 2, 1. I'm split in the middle. This one's not burnt, but not too rubbery. I think this is pretty nice. It's not bad. The pastries from the fancy oven are in the middle. Oh, okay. You were right. I'm not too surprised. The burnt ones on Rhett's side Black and Decker. They make It. Pop Tarts Black and Decker. Yeah, that's why they call it that. But yeah, Link, So it's like. It's mid in the middle. It's good enough in the middle. You said for how much? $200. $192. Yeah. Whoops. Be quiet, be quiet. Settle down, Oster. All right, so we're not ruffling any Good. Not yet. Moving from breakfast Oh, this is what I do every day. I always follow my breakfast pastries up with salmon Cajun, specifically Cajun salmon. And they use the broil Oh, the broil setting. Oh, don't hold back. You know, you look like you might be Oh, Because he does also look Oh, and also for salmon. Cause I'm wearing red? Well, yeah. Cause you're in front of and it looks like there's a logo It seems a little bit European. Welcome to my salmon show on the side of Mount Snow. This is a vintage piece of skiing top. Oh, are you skiing later? Skiing, yeah. It's a skiing top. I don't know. I just kind of liked it, so I bought it. It's got patches on it. Thank you for noticing. Okay. Salmon. Salmon is not anything I ever seek out, It's hard to say no to when. When it's forced on me, I do eat it. Because there's so many people that say, And this is actually pretty good salmon. Two days ago, I had a plate of salmon I was like, well, gotta do it. Oh. that's not bad, that first one. It's flaky. While on a hike or like, at a restaurant? At a luncheon, you know. Seen some of my cohorts from my previous job. Luncheon, huh? This right here. The first one has a crispier top. Oh, it does? a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. They're both dece. Both dece. Both dece. But let me go for this third. Let me go for this third one. I'm looking for one that's int. I got some of the salmon skin on there. You're supposed to eat the salmon skin. Right? The best part for you. It's like the potato. It's like the potato skin. That's good fart. That's good fart. Didn't mean to say that. But I did, and I meant it. That's a good fart. This one's a little over. Is it omegas? Yeah, but it's the right omegas, which I believe is the threes, not the sixes. This one's juicier. Does that mean it's undercooked? This one's dramatically better. It might just be a better fish. They're all from the same fish. They're from the same fish. Really? They're all from the same fish. They're from the same fish. This is all one fish. What if it's just from fish Fish friends. Friends who are eating together stay together? There's still not. There's not a remarkable difference here. There's not a remarkable difference. I'm definitely not paying $400 more for one of these salmons. I think this one got a little bit drier. I thought it was moister. It's my favorite. Well, did you eat from the Well, do you want to guess which It does taste the best. Yeah. From the fanciest. Yeah, that's what I'm going to do. It does taste the best. 3, 2, 1. It tastes the best. Is it? Wow. My, my, my. You've both chosen the low price point. Black and Decker you did it. Black and Decker can't but it can make a salmon? Yeah. The first plate was the fancy oven, like, I forgot. I forgot what I said. Oh, are you changing your mind? I said it was a little bit crispier. Well, so I. But I bet I There. The only textural difference I noticed was that this one was a little bit crispy. So I don't know if that's worth the money, I'm glad that Black and Decker has gotten the point this round, They're not afraid to show you the entire bottom of their toaster oven. And they need a little love for That's right. Especially their handheld ones. What about their drills? I don't like the drills. I don't like their drills. Quick reminder.

The biggest thing with toaster ovens What do you do with your... counter space? why not make it something that can be and like, inside of something inside of, you know, If everybody needs one of these, I don't want it to be Say more about this fixture. How about like, a fridge is a fixture. A microwave is now a fixture. Even like... How about in the middle Your kitchen table, an ice freezer? Down there. In the middle of your kitchen table, you put a nice covering over a toaster oven and put a candelabra on top of it. And people are like, I love your candle stand. And you're like, let me show you something. And then you move how big this. Is as a centerpiece. Yeah. How big is your table? Not big enough. No. You can put maybe And then when it's time to toast, you. Voila. And it's almost like a trick. I feel like putting any appliance defeat that you didn't design your kitchen well enough. Well, then where do you put it? I don't have one because I don't like putting Lando is sitting on a rice cooker. Okay. I think. I think that needs to be... I think that needs to be embedded in a piece of kitchen furniture. I'll put that on the coffee table. First one tasted horrible. It tasted horrible. It wasn't horrible. It tasted like a school lunch burger. It tasted like an old burger. Yeah. That's not horrible. That's just like an old burger. Why can't you say that it tastes horrible? It does. It's an old burger. Oh, because I've spent a lot of and eating them like this. Are you against me because of what Oh, I'm not against you. That was a little better. I just really think that the centerpiece and I'm upset about it... All right. Think about it. A candelabra. And then every time you want you have to remove your candelabra. Just so you can visualize. Picture this as black, I mean, are you looking for a Because I don't think we have one. Just picture that mug is a candelabra, and you got to use your imagination. But how pretty is that?

You're watching to see if he swallowed. He's not actually eating that. Oh, he just kind of froze. He better swallow. I got you. One. The fancy one is on Link's side. The one in front of Rhett is the low price. But it tasted the worst. It really did. I'm really sensitive to these meat tastes, but again, 400 additional dollars, that's. It's not worth it to heat up. If you're heating up a baconator a day later and you want it to. You want it to taste amazing, you're gonna spend 400 more You're right. Okay. We really took it up a notch the kitcheneers baked cornbread and homemade donuts. Homemade donuts? The bake setting, full on baked them. So what, Lily, what did you do? You just, poured dough into a mold and then you. You plopped down... Yes. Yeah. It stays in a mold. Like a muffin can. Muffin tin. Like a donut tin, but yeah. You could have just agreed with me. I was so close. Yeah. You've blown his mind. It's cakey. Oh, I'm sorry. There you go, have it. Apology accepted. See, I have a coffee maker on my countertop... I have a blender on my countertop. I can handle that. I have a rice cooker on my countertop. Then I had to find a in the corner. Oh, you have. You have that bust of I got the bust of Michael Jordan. Right? Yep. And then you got the little ostrich. I have a picture of a moose. I do have that. A painting of a moose that to be in a certain place, propped in front of the light switch and the disposal. So every time I need to see or dispose of I have to move the moose painting over. And you think there's And you got the. There's no room for this. You've got the Cheshire cat. I've got the ceramic cookie holding And then you've got the little cat that goes like this. Like from the Chinese restaurants. Did you steal those? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a whole collection of those. Right. And that's like a corner of the kitchen... And then I have the turnabout with all Why do we have eight different oils... that are all olive oil? I don't know. Cause the bottles look cool. That's what she won't say. He has this crock pot that's so big. But then when you open it up, Yeah, it's a crock pot holding crock pot. And then you open that one, It's a Russian nested crock pot. It's a Russian nested crock pot. 17 crocks deep. I can't tell you. And none of it is as big as this thing. Is this a bit, or did you memorize He's been over. It's hard to tell. So you. Did you memorized everything Yep. He's been over. And then he has one wall. Where would this go? That looks like another section of the kitchen, but it's just wallpaper. Well I have to give an illusion He got that from Ikea. He spent the night there and stole it. And it looks like more kitchen. Interestingly, I've walked into it multiple times. So is my dogs. Oh, I got more kitchen. I mean, where would this go? Look, it's wider than my forearm... It's taller than this part of my arm. This hole didn't have a hole. I don't believe anything is standing out in round one or round two. I mean, plate one or two. Plate three. The donut doesn't have a hole. The bisque muffin is burnt. This donut doesn't have a hole. What would that mean? Would that be user error or. No, just the way it rose was different. Okay. then he has a tin man in one corner and it's motion activated. You walk past it. Batteries are dead, though. And it extends its hand. When it's working, it extends its hand up and you shake it Right. Batteries are dead, though. Okay, boys. I don't. This one's burnt. I mean, look at that. There's one that's better than And I'm going to vote for it. Well, so this means a lot. This answer that you give right now. I like a crispy. A crispy biscuit. Three, two, one. Oh, man. No, this is the best one. I insist. You want to change? I'm not afraid to change. Okay, you're officially changing? Yep, I'm officially changing. And I'm not afraid to Okay, the fancy one is in front of Rhett. I was wrong. High price point one is in the middle. And then of course, not great looking is the which means. But how did you know? Rhett, how did he know? Well, this one was clearly the worst one. Okay, Rhett, But the bigger question is, who wins the blue ribbon in terms of Well, you know, too often in our experience. That's true. We like the Wolf. But paying 600 bucks. I don't think $400 more is worth. I just don't think the definitive to justify spending three I think if you need a toaster oven, For real.
