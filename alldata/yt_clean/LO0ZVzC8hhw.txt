An external has ordered 18 units, with deliveries starting Additional upgrades include provisions for self-protection guns, and DAS integration aim to optimize performance in challenging 5 KAI LAH: This is a twin-engine combat helicopter partnership with Airbus Helicopters, based on close air support, escort, and troop transport, helicopters of the Republic of Korea Army. The and it is expected to enter service in 2025. Armed it features stub wings for carrying 70mm It has a maximum speed of 243 km/h, a range and a climb rate of 8.9 m/s. The helicopter is advanced weaponry and performance capabilities. warning and control aircraft, based on the replace the Beriev A-50, it features four more power than the previous model. The A-100 with a rotating radar dome housing the Vega fast-moving targets. The radar has a detection km for warships. The aircraft also includes a and satellite communication. It is powered capable of reaching a top speed of Mach 0.82 airborne early warning and control Type 003 aircraft carriers by 2024. It features two WJ-6 turboprops, and a distinctive quad-tail likely housing an AESA radar system, and The aircraft is equipped with 3 AESA radars in The KJ-600's maiden flight occurred on 29 through 2021 and 2023. With a crew of 5-6, it has and a service ceiling of 15,000 meters. This is a US stealth, multirole unmanned combat for the Royal Australian Air Force. It serves aircraft to enhance integrated operations or intelligence. The Ghost Bat features a modular range exceeding 2,000 nautical miles. Powered by boasts &quot;fighter-like&quot; maneuverability. Its stealth shape rather than radiation-absorbent materials. refueling drone developed from the Carrier-Based 19 September 2019, the MQ-25 is powered by a over 10,000 pounds force of thrust. It features V-tail but is less stealthy than flying wing a wingspan of 75 ft (22.9 m) extended, the MQ-25 shown in April 2024, include AGM-158C LRASM and an electro-optical sensor ball under refueling and limited strike capabilities. electronic attack aircraft, featuring structural the integration of the Next Generation complex electromagnetic environments and will capabilities. The aircraft will also include on station. The US Navy plans to upgrade its with the first upgrade completed in March 2021. the Growler has a maximum speed of Mach 1.6 11 A-29N Super Tucano: This is a Brazilian armed reconnaissance, advanced training, The updated version features a new expanding its mission potential. Notable for its it can simulate combat and manage flight data. laser designator, night-vision goggles, secure A-29N excels in surveillance, and reconnaissance,
