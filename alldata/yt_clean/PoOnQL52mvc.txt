hello welcome to this presentation today we're going to learn how to read a micrometer screw gauge and the question we have reads the diagram below shows a portion of a micrometer screw gauge used to measure the diameter of a metal pipe the reading on the gauge when the jaws were fully closed without the pipe was 0.012 centimeters so this is the diagram then part a what is the diameter of the pipe and then finally part b given that the length of the pipe is 1.40 centimeters find its volume okay let's do part a what is the diameter of the pipe in other words we are asked to read the scale provided here now for a micrometer screw gauge we have these two parts that contain the scale this part here is called the sleeve and this part here is called the thimble so the scale on the thimble is referred to as timbal scale and the scale on the sleeve is referred to as the sleeve scale so we are going to take the readings on the scales and we are going to begin with sleeve scale and for the sleeve scale on the upper part these are the millimeter marks so we have zero one two three four five five millimeters and we need to take note that there are half millimeter marks these shorter marks in between the millimeter marks so those are the half millimeter marks and in case we are able to see half millimeter mark on the sleeve scale then any measurement that we take should be 0.50 so on the sleeve scale here we have five and then because of the half millimeter marks we'll have to add point five zero so we have five point five zero and this is in millimeters let's now look at the thimble scale the reading on the thimble scale that we'll consider will be the mark on the thimble scale that coincides with the center line of the sleeve scale now this is the center line as you continue with it this line that coincides with it this right here will be where we'll be taking our reading so if this is 10 it increases upwards 10 11 12 so that is the 12th mark now for the thimble scale that reading that you have gotten right up there we have to multiply it by 0.01 and that means whatever we'll have as the reading is 0.12 millimeters we have multiplied 12 by 0.01 and then the reading we get here is 5.62 millimeters we're told that the reading on the gauge when the jaws were fully closed without the pipe was 0.012 centimeters now we need to take note that that is the zero error if you have the jaws closed without an object between the jaws the reading that you take there should be the zero error and for this case the zero error is positive so we will have to correct the zero error by subtracting that reading from what we've gotten here from 5.62 so we have the zero error we are told [Music] 0.01 centimeters now remember our readings are in millimeters so we have to convert this in millimeters so that we're able to use it in the problem so 10 millimeters should be equivalent to 1 centimeter so 0.012 centimeters should be equal to 0.12 millimeters so at this point we are going to correct the zero error by having the diameter giving us five point six two minus the zero error because the zero error is positive zero error we subtract so minus zero point one two and that should give us 5.50 millimeters that is for part a let's move to part b given that the length of the pipe is 1.4 0 centimeters find its volume now we know that a pipe is cylindrical in nature and the length therefore given as 1.4 centimeters 1.4 centimeters we need to convert this in millimeters so that we'll be able to match the units as the ones we had earlier on so 1.4 centimeters should be equivalent to 14 millimeters once again 10 millimeters should be equivalent to one centimeter at this particular point we say volume is therefore given by pi r squared times the length and that means we'll have 22 over 7 times the radius radius we take the diameter we already got here 5.50 divided by 2. so the diameter 5.5 over 2 and then we square and then we'll multiply by this length 14. that when we work out from my calculator i'm able to get [Music] 332.75 cubic millimeters and so that marks the end of the solution to this problem thank you for watching hope to see you in the next video
