It's time to go back to the &gt;&gt; Jeff has said over and over work he's doing is work in What he's built in Amazon is interesting, and it's, it's But it's only revolutionized &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos's plan is to future of humanity. &gt;&gt; Manufactured worlds rotated to create artificial gravity These are very large structures, And they hold a million people &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It's an idea he's &gt;&gt; This is me in high school. And I want to highlight this quote: &quot;The earth is finite, and population is to keep expanding, I still believe that. &gt;&gt; The way Jeff Bezos sees is it is that consumerism is an lives better than our parents And he wants, you know, future an increasingly better &gt;&gt; These are beautiful. People are going to want to live here. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos unveiled his extra-terrestrial plans at a the empire he's built here on &gt;&gt; Amazon is the great to grocery stores. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For more than 25 years, Jeff Bezos has been almost every aspect of our &gt;&gt; Once you start connecting the building all of the invisible &gt;&gt; Amazon announced a healthcare &gt;&gt; Amazon is helping the C.I.A. &gt;&gt; How much of the internet do &gt;&gt; That's a good question, um, &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in recent come under scrutiny for their power. (Bezos laughing) &gt;&gt; Everything that is admirable that we should fear about it. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For the past year, we've been investigating how and at what cost. &gt;&gt; And so think about this. Big things start small. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jeff Bezos's empire Valley, but on Wall Street. That's where the young Princeton graduate went to work in the hedge fund called D.E. Shaw. &gt;&gt; David Shaw was the one who introducing data. And I think Jeff really embraced that, that idea that, &quot;Hey, if win.&quot; &gt;&gt; One of the things that David Shaw asked Jeff Bezos to do was businesses, and in particular '90s called the World Wide Web. (dial-up modem connecting) &gt;&gt; We all know that a underway in this country. &gt;&gt; What is the internet? &gt;&gt; It's sort of the mother of &gt;&gt; It's information highways. &gt;&gt; It's kind of like your remote control to the world. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos was quick to see the untapped potential of was determined to get in on it. &gt;&gt; I came across this startling statistic that web usage was So, I decided I would try and sense in the context of that the first best product to sell unusual in one respect, and items in the book category than category by far. So, when you have that many items, you can literally build a any other way. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The store he was imagining didn't exist, so he to start selling books on the you know, from a lot of the His mom tried to convince him to weekends. She didn't want to see him give up his job. &gt;&gt; Jeff called, and he told me that he and MacKenzie were were moving to Seattle and I said, &quot;Great, well, what are He said, &quot;We're going to sell I said, &quot;Nice.&quot; He said, &quot;On the internet.&quot; I said, &quot;Oh. Jeff, why will anybody buy anything from you?&quot; And he said, &quot;Well, we're going to have more books than anybody &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: One of the first new website was Relentless.com. &gt;&gt; Why &quot;Relentless?&quot; &gt;&gt; Relentless meant, &quot;We move on He ultimately, obviously, quite the right fit. Amazon, earth's largest river, was. Amazon means gigantic. &gt;&gt; In terms of nothing, that's, is that an apt &gt;&gt; No. It's not that Jeff stops at nothing, it's that when Jeff thinks he can achieve, he won't or until he achieves it. &gt;&gt; Jeff and MacKenzie had rented And then we moved to a small, south part of Seattle. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Shel Kaphan was Amazon employee number one, one who agreed to talk on camera. &gt;&gt; What the company is now was nowhere in my wildest Nowhere, so, the fact that it position in the world that it &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In July 1995, &gt;&gt; It was an incredible novelty, it's very hard to imagine, but now dominates did not exist. &gt;&gt; Amazon.com, this virtual shop claims to be the world's &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It didn't take long prescient. &gt;&gt; What makes us different is vast selection, convenience-- we If our catalog were printed on seven New York City phonebooks. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The company quickly more than 50 employees. In 1996, James Marcus applied to be number 55. &gt;&gt; There was a very palpable excitement in the air at this point Jeff Bezos was the first prospective employee. So I was ushered into his office. He wanted to see how fast you were on your feet. He also always wanted to know your S.A.T. scores. &gt;&gt; He wanted to know your S.A.T. scores? &gt;&gt; Every time, yes. &gt;&gt; How old were you at &gt;&gt; I was 36 or 37. &gt;&gt; This is the original sign that I made for Amazon.com. Blue spray paint on white poster board. &gt;&gt; Jeff wasn't a figure out of folklore at that point, he was the world. &gt;&gt; Here's my computer, Amazon.com up on the screen. &quot;Hello, Jeff Bezos.&quot; &gt;&gt; He was a small, nondescript, desk with quite a large and (laughing in multiple scenes) was a normal guy to a sort of &gt;&gt; HAL 9000 hat, very important. Hal and I share a birthday, we're both born on January 12. &gt;&gt; It belied, you know, an enormous, Napoleonic ambition. &gt;&gt; One of the people I really like, Thomas Edison, here's a bulb. He's famous for saying, &quot;One percent inspiration, 99 percent (laughs) part, execution is everything. &gt;&gt; Domination was on Jeff's mind from the beginning. One of his sort of second-in-command people said that Jeff wants to sell many And Jeff's idea is that in the buy a kayak from Amazon. And if, and after you brought the kayak, you could figure out travel services from Amazon.&quot; So, those ambitions were very clear, and this was very early But he was clearly thinking in &gt;&gt; How did that ring to &gt;&gt; A little bit exciting and a &gt;&gt; Amazon.com, very good You should really try it. (Bezos laughs) &gt;&gt; If you signed on to work at bookstore, and the guy who about selling, you know, every weren't sure how seriously to (Bezos laughing) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Though his public &gt;&gt; That was awesome! &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Inside the company, Bezos was a hard-charging the principle that would make brands in the world: the &gt;&gt; This culture of customer Obsessive focus on customer... Obsesses over our customers... Totally obsessing over the &gt;&gt; We used to call it customer It means building, delivering, And we did it, you know, in the stage. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jennifer Cast was there in the early days and is the company put forward to &gt;&gt; Customer obsession was our And so, you know, it was a place something that was new, the There was an excitement that we been done before. It was exhilarating. We were all aligned around &gt;&gt; Hey, you guys. &gt;&gt; Hey. (Bezos laughs) an empty chair that would often &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who was in the empty chair? &gt;&gt; Yeah, so that empty chair was there to remind us all to empathy for the customer, customer experience. The customer isn't there, we have to bring forward the voice (phone ringing) Amazon.com. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And Bezos quickly learned that in this new online exactly how customers were &gt;&gt; All orders do need to be &gt;&gt; It was made clear from the was also one of Amazon's All customer behavior that recorded and tracked. And that itself was a valuable commodity. &gt;&gt; Have you visited our website? &gt;&gt; We could track how a customer So we could see what you looked paused at, we could see what you order, we could see what you put So that's when we started This is rich, rich, rich.&quot; And so we've used it for everything. &gt;&gt; What do you do with that information? &gt;&gt; That's the data that allows us to predict, or try to would like that you haven't &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos treated the studied customer behavior along Weigend. &gt;&gt; I was shocked to see how predictable people are. If you take the time of the day into account, if you take maybe how long they were on the site the site today, you know what &gt;&gt; Whoever owns, collects, the and rights to data, then you are It's all about the data. Everything. &gt;&gt; One of the most fascinating disposal is the ability to do It's, you know, it's kind of &gt;&gt; We did not think about it as helping people make better &gt;&gt; I was starting to feel that the consumer, who was, after person whose ecstasy was our And it was closer to getting a extracting as many pails as And that felt a little more But that was the business of &gt;&gt; Amazon has added 880,000 new &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Bezos was more and more customers into &gt;&gt; The number of customers who fourfold... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There was one thing he hadn't done yet. &gt;&gt; The company's never made a profit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, why... how does that... &gt;&gt; It seems like a new math, &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos would spend years losing money trying to convinced investors to go along &gt;&gt; One of Jeff Bezos' greatest ability to get Wall Street to 20-some years, Amazon wasn't And that's okay because they're will create huge opportunities customers and gain business. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He spelled it out in a letter to shareholders public: &quot;It's all about the than short-term profits or Wall &gt;&gt; He essentially says, in order to take market share. That our strategy is to lose money, which enables us then to business who can't afford to &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That strategy like Stacy Mitchell, who &gt;&gt; In essence, at the very shareholders, &quot;I have a strategy that's going to reward you, but road, and will you come along And they said yes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Investors also recognized Bezos' essential which had to charge their online businesses. &gt;&gt; So, not collecting sales tax gave Amazon a big leg up over And that was central to their market share as quickly as they &gt;&gt; What booksellers were saying my customers to Amazon. They'll come into the store, they'll browse, they find what buy it on Amazon, because they &gt;&gt; So it was a very irksome, vendors, first of all, they were mine, so to speak, and then lots warehouse workers and three &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon's sales-tax its success as it expanded products. &gt;&gt; And we have a fantastic selection of things you can Electronics and then of course Yeah, thank you, here is, we've This is more than ten times the a typical, physical world &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Bezos was still Amazon being the place where you (drills whirring) &gt;&gt; Amazon could soon become the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There were sell online. Bezos offered them a way to do it. &gt;&gt; Amazon is transforming itself from an online bookstore to an &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He transformed where anyone could sell their invited thousands of other &gt;&gt; It's the easiest place for wants to set up shop online to access our 12 million-plus Anybody, all comers. &gt;&gt; We're talking about hundreds of thousands of companies with products. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Name-brand stores started selling on Bezos's thousands of small &gt;&gt; Everyone knew Amazon.com. The only people that knew SuperDuperHoops.com were the a basketball hoop and saw our To us it was really a We knew that we would, you know, First year we did 100,000, next two million, four million, we early days. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was great for the companies-- and even greater &gt;&gt; Amazon has become the most &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Not only would he businesses sold, he'd also keep competing against everyone else controlled. &gt;&gt; He owns the Main Street. He has the Main Street real Not just one building on the wield its power over the online become a question for government were indications. The first to see them were book publishers. &gt;&gt; Amazon took over a large market share of the publishing They were very quickly in a You know, I think that was a to realize, &quot;Oh, wait a minute, but they now have the windpipe.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Inside the company, they had launched a strategy Project,&quot; because they'd heard publishers the way a cheetah &gt;&gt; Well, you don't go after the It's like the cheetah. The cheetah looks for the weak, looks for the sick, looks for for. So don't start with, you know, number one publisher. Start with number seven publisher and then number six get to number three, two, and back to them. They're going to know this is coming, and chances are you may full-on war. &gt;&gt; We were just this little mom and pop publishing company, translated fiction. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the early 2000s, the number of books Dennis had been rising steadily. Then one day, he got a phone call. &gt;&gt; Our distributor called us up to talk about our Amazon And he said, &quot;I went out to it was like going out to dinner They want a kickback.&quot; That's the word he used, kickback. And he said they wanted four percent more of our sales. &gt;&gt; Was that unusual? &gt;&gt; It was... in our experience, yes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Randy Miller ran the European book team and says Amazon's tough tactics to and profit margins. &gt;&gt; In order to bring them into line, we would actually take merchandising, take their prices references on the product page, want it cheaper, you want this way cheaper price? Click here.&quot; And we'd send them to whoever we was. That was how Amazon forced their vendors to-to comply. (stammering): But that's an old Walmart trick, I mean, it And it made, it made a And, you know, Jeff kind of got &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: When Dennis Johnson Amazon's terms, he says the buy books suddenly disappeared, customers to purchase them on &gt;&gt; I mean, this is the company publishers like me as wounded That's how they think, that's beginning. And we eventually had to pay what at the time I called a And our attitude toward Amazon Caesar that which is Caesar's.&quot; And then carry on as best as you can. &gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos may say that Amazon comes along and has access to a huge distribution Has Amazon been good for your &gt;&gt; Well, absolutely they have. Any bookseller that sells our books is good for our business. So, I'm not complaining that Amazon is selling our books. I'm just complaining of the way that their tactics are hurting &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to responded to written questions. Regarding Dennis Johnson's characterizations, it told us, account.&quot; &gt;&gt; Were you uncomfortable with that sort of &gt;&gt; Well, no, 'cause I was in that's ruthless. You know, I looked, and some people at Amazon, &quot;Wow, that's &quot;Oh, a retailer and a supplier Stop the presses!&quot; It happens all the time. I mean, you know, look, you've somebody's going to have to And-and a lot of times Amazon &gt;&gt; Kindle is a purpose-built &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The tension between ramp up even further with the helped the industry transition Amazon more power to set prices &gt;&gt; And new releases are only &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Around that time, broad antitrust enforcement, was by what he was hearing from &gt;&gt; If the door was open, the know, Amazon, they're just a biggest customer. They buy the most books, they sell the most books. We love them.&quot; Then you close the door, and our business model, they're have way too much power, we &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Lynn wanted publicly and thought federal investigate whether Amazon was a market dominance in &gt;&gt; And they'd say, &quot;No way, I'm in public. I'm not talking about them on Capitol Hill. They will take retribution against me.&quot; &gt;&gt; To which you responded? &gt;&gt; &quot;Well, that's why we have to do something about it.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jennifer Cast ran Amazon's books division in its &gt;&gt; We've had a difficult publishers to talk to us on In part, it seems the reason is How do you react to that, that uncomfortable to talk about &gt;&gt; I don't know, I mean, I-I &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I haven't been in your shoes. I'm sure they have... I mean, don't talk negatively about us, of good things to say about us. Um, you know, I-I don't know why they wouldn't speak their minds. We certainly value speaking our minds. &gt;&gt; There is this well-known anecdote about Gazelle Program. Do you know about that? &gt;&gt; I don't. &gt;&gt; We've talked to former Amazonians about it, basically try to negotiate with better terms and treat the would go after a wounded &gt;&gt; I didn't hear the cheetah were looking for was people that the old model of bricks and was, you know, a-a virtual store opportunities to present their &gt;&gt; I want to talk a little bit innovation at Amazon.com. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon would begin to accumulate even more power in out a revolutionary new program: &gt;&gt; Now they have something program. &gt;&gt; Amazon Prime-- we only launched this a week ago-- two-day shipping for free. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was a risky bet, and it paid off. &gt;&gt; The lynchpin, or the glue, if you will, and probably the business history, was the the most successful membership Prime. &gt;&gt; Many of you in this audience will already be Amazon Prime This is very much appreciated. &gt;&gt; It changes the way you shop. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Eventually more sign up for the free shipping-- But to Bezos, it was worth it. &gt;&gt; The Prime program at Amazon is one of the most important When you go on and look to buy a two days, delivered to your door Amazon Prime program becomes a you back as a customer to keep new products on Amazon. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Two-day delivery anywhere in the country was a at the time, had less than ten So Bezos went on a building warehouses began to spring up, products being sold on Bezos's He'd call them fulfillment hundreds of thousands of jobs Recession. &gt;&gt; Ten percent of Pennsylvania residents unemployed... &gt;&gt; Job market is in complete disarray. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like Allentown, Pennsylvania. &gt;&gt; At that time, it was tremendous news that an employer a facility and hiring people, the staff. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spencer Soper was a business reporter for the Amazon opened in the area in He began hearing stories about &gt;&gt; People are basically in this stocked with goods in very And they have scanners that And people are walking maybe So people just kind of all day long. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As workers told him about the punishing pace to meet the intense heat, Soper and his investigate further. &gt;&gt; People really felt like Amazon was playing fast and health. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Soper discovered there had been numerous Occupational Safety and Health &gt;&gt; They actually had a complaint who called their hotline one day to check out this Amazon place. I've had, like, people parading through my emergency room to be There was a security guard who a complaint to OSHA saying that heat stress in-in the facility. And so there's just, like, these red flags right and left. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After an investigation, OSHA said Amazon in the warehouses lower. In a statement at the time, the company said it installed new pledged that worker safety was &gt;&gt; Amazon is shrewd businesspeople know when they And when you're the only shop push them a lot harder than alternatives. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Over the following years, Amazon would hire workers and become one of creators in the country. At the fulfillment centers, Bezos experimented with new boost productivity. &gt;&gt; Willingness to experiment is the key to be able to do new So we do, you know, hundreds of fulfillment centers to get a Kind of like incremental called Kiva perfected a the whole company. &gt;&gt; Amazon has acquired Kiva Systems. They make shipping robots. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It helped transform warehouses. &gt;&gt; When I first showed up at Amazon in 1999, I led our Global &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jeff Wilke created system and is one of two C.E.O.s &gt;&gt; As we've added 200,000 since 2012 we've added 300,000 centers. So what happens is the robots change the work, so they allow as far, which is a complaint They make the job safer, they because we present a smaller set And that's all good for employees too. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But at the same time, complaints have persisted. &gt;&gt; People who've worked in warehouses for decades say, This is not the same.&quot; We're here today because we want to make sure that these in the workplace, especially &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Sheheryar Kaoosji workers in the San Bernardino, hub, with ten fulfillment employees. &gt;&gt; Because of the way that Amazon operates, because of the for productivity, it's a lot psychologically. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We sat down with a group in San Bernardino who'd &gt;&gt; When they first got here, I Like, for me, I was thinking where, you know, I'm going to know, move up in-in the place. But after being there for a while, I was like, &quot;There's no &gt;&gt; It's like, &quot;Okay, this is career.&quot; But once you worked there for a certain amount of time, it's realistic, how they expect you &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like dozens of the country, they say they've rate Amazon expected them to &gt;&gt; How realistic are the I mean, what's... &gt;&gt; Not realistic at all. &gt;&gt; Not-not realistic? &gt;&gt; No. There's absolutely no way to find little ways to-to cheat by the end of the week, they again. Because they start seeing, &quot;Hey, people can hit those rates, let's push them a little Every week it seemed like it was right behind you at all times, 24-seven. And if you don't meet standards or the rates, you're out the &gt;&gt; Every worker has a scanner at exactly where you're at. &gt;&gt; And they have a little blue line at the bottom of the many seconds that you have to zero, and it puts you into panic &gt;&gt; And pretty much you can't the same aisle as them, you there scanning like a robot all If they catch you not scanning, &gt;&gt; And what they're doing is data that they are using to be workforce. &gt;&gt; We're not treated as human beings, we're not even treated We're treated as part of the &gt;&gt; It's the incentive at line, to get the most out of any &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To make rates, to-to be as efficient as possible, to So, I don't see exactly what's opposed to any other warehouse. &gt;&gt; Amazon is the cutting edge. Other warehouses are starting to companies are definitely is doing. Data collection could become basically the standard for all you're never good enough, rates are not based on performance, and that the not for tracking people but the warehouse industry. &gt;&gt; We've talked to workers around the country, They've described the pace of In the early thinking about push human beings in terms of thinking about that? &gt;&gt; Well, obviously if the rates are too high, you're not going work. So, we have 600,000 people at the company, most of them are in they-they come to work every These are considered great jobs where we have fulfillment and in the U.S. we have, almost it, and people come to work They're safe, we pay double the minimum wage, we have terrific The benefits for the folks that benefits that my family has like 20 weeks. So, the rates are set so that we can accomplish what we need to, in a-a reasonable time and in a creates a workplace that people do. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon wouldn't tell us how long on the job or how often they're But workers we spoke to say the warehouses-- and that the unionize. &gt;&gt; We do not believe unions are in the best interest of our most importantly, our &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is a clip from used in the past to teach rights and labor laws. &gt;&gt; The most obvious signs would include use of words associated movements like &quot;living wage&quot; or &gt;&gt; Early on, Amazon took anti-union. Why was that decision made? &gt;&gt; I don't think we made the We just feel that all of the would-would want to-to get us &gt;&gt; What-what about Do you not see that there's a hands of management in this a unionized environment? &gt;&gt; I don't know, it's hard to speculate on that, but-but I do obligation to set rates that people to seek these jobs and what we've promised. &gt;&gt; What would you say to someone, though, who's, who's centers that feels as though are increasingly being treated 'Cause it's something that we've sense it's hyperbole. &gt;&gt; Well, that's not the experience that-that I had in seen. It's, it's certainly true that-that these jobs are not for be people that don't want to do &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon executives become an industry leader in career advancement. &gt;&gt; We just announced a pledge recently to spend $700 million creating career opportunities employees. We pay 95% of tuition to go to-to college to get a skill about creating options for the those people to take advantage couple of years and then go do rather do, and that's okay. &gt;&gt; There will be people that will hear what y'all are you signed up for physical were benefits, and they are now do retraining for other types of What's the real grievance? What is there to complain about?&quot; &gt;&gt; I actually used to think that way for a while whenever I, when complaints from, I was like, description, and you signed up The part they don't talk about have to ignore to make rate. It's not just you go in, okay, and you-you do your job, and &gt;&gt; So, you're in, you're &gt;&gt; It's incredibly hard to meet safety procedures. &gt;&gt; A complaint that we've heard from workers in of their work as humans, some of are high safety standards in that in order to make rate, standard a little bit. &gt;&gt; Well, I would say that's not okay. So I, from the moment that I arrived 20 years ago, I made it teams that we will not employees to do anything else. So, we have, we have a culture that if-if we are asking people they have to do too fast to be and say, &quot;This isn't right,&quot; (phone vibrates) has put a happy face on its (&quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; by &gt;&gt; Give a little bit love... the people are almost like It's all about boxes, and singing and bumbling their way &gt;&gt; There's so much that we &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Hey. &gt;&gt; They don't want you to even They just want you to be wowed get here?&quot; &gt;&gt; I'll give a little bit of my love to you. think, &quot;Whoa, magic!&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And magic was a big strategy, with an emphasis on of innovation and growth. &gt;&gt; We started Amazon Prime in 2005, but then something very This. In 2011, the slope of that graph changed-- a lot. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Amazon grew, he wanted his top executives to it was becoming. He wrote a memo titled, &quot;Amazon.love.&quot; A copy of it was obtained by Brad Stone. &gt;&gt; The memo is another example of Jeff being very prescient It's Jeff grappling with the are loved. That there is something that we get uncomfortable with when we &quot;Rudeness is not cool. Defeating tiny guys is not cool. Risk taking is cool. Winning is cool. Polite is cool. Defeating bigger, unsympathetic guys is cool. Inventing is cool. Explorers are cool. Conquerors are not cool.&quot; &gt;&gt; Some businesses, you can meetings with them, they have a And there's a big difference being an explorer. And I think in, you know, this very inventive space that we're watching Amazon's growth, the that ideal, and taking steps to way. In 2013, Amazon was moving to and made a key decision: rather built a network of independent &gt;&gt; They weren't just going to They were going to go and create FedEx or UPS. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: ProPublica reporter Patricia Callahan, in investigated the system Amazon &gt;&gt; They figured out a way to get The cargo vans they choose are hundreds of Amazon packages, but they're not regulated by the &gt;&gt; An 84-year-old woman struck delivery truck. &gt;&gt; A woman hit and killed in a parking lot. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: ProPublica and Buzzfeed found that drivers are deliver packages. &gt;&gt; After striking him, the van maneuvered around Salinas &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And they documented 13 deaths, since 2015. &gt;&gt; An infant critically injured in a car crash has died. &gt;&gt; When it came time to figure out who's responsible, Amazon contractor, it's not our &gt;&gt; Now you've been able And that's over the course of Is that statistically packages that they deliver in &gt;&gt; I don't pretend to claim that I found every single one. I just found enough to show that this is happening around the With UPS, there's a record. There's a federal record you can look at how many serious injury With Amazon, that doesn't exist. No one knows the safety records of all of Amazon's contractors. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon disputed the ProPublica report. It would not release any data on crashes involving its driver &quot;better than average&quot; safety important to them than safety. &gt;&gt; Any accident is one accident too many, so just as we were fulfillment centers and product high standards with all of those We have training videos for the to help them understand what we have mapping software that we routes. Every one of our drivers is required, including the third comprehensive insurance, so that if there is an accident covered. &gt;&gt; Amazon wants to get Prime members their packages even &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In the last year, way it handles Prime deliveries.

Has it been safety-tested for durability? If a child chews on it, will the paint come off? Is that paint leaded? &gt;&gt; Most people would high safety standard on Amazon. &gt;&gt; And that assumption would be incorrect. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: She says that's because Amazon, like other tech that it's not legally harmed by products sold by third &gt;&gt; If someone buys something at Target, a consumer can sue &gt;&gt; Right, 'cause no one's into Walmart, to enter the doors They aren't making you sign &gt;&gt; But when do you sign &gt;&gt; When you make your account. When you accept the terms and conditions. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: People have been challenging Amazon's terms and Some have even been successful. &gt;&gt; Ultimately, who's on the hook when a customer buys a Who takes ultimate &gt;&gt; Well, in the rare case where happens, if it's a third-party third-party seller, and it is to sell a legitimate product to Amazon is the retailer, and we customer, then it's our understand the manufacturer and product and its, and its safety. &gt;&gt; But when the other sellers are selling in your for it ultimately, if they're defective or dangerous product? &gt;&gt; I think the way things work in the U.S. is that the seller setting the price and who is things not sold by Amazon-- and it'll tell you who the seller responsibility for those things, It says Amazon.com whenever we &gt;&gt; Do you audit your they're actually providing safe &gt;&gt; We do... You know, some of our sales... So about, almost 60% of our and those sales, some of them party, so we're not involved &gt;&gt; But you take a cut. I mean, it's on your infrastructure, it goes through &gt;&gt; Well, it's on our website and payments, but we're &gt;&gt; And fees that, you sale, right? &gt;&gt; Sure, sure, and we're providing, you know, traffic You know, it's kind of the way why they would pay that fee, It's harder to, before an product. &gt;&gt; A South Carolina woman who bought a hair dryer on Amazon &gt;&gt; Fire is coming out of the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon's approach &gt;&gt; A hoverboard caused a fire &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dangerous products Washington State. &gt;&gt; ...found dozens of school supplies that had high levels &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And a recent report unsafe, or mislabeled products. &gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time understanding something, which You know, Amazon's entire brand &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That it's... &gt;&gt; Oh, I reminded them of this &gt;&gt; You reminded them of &gt;&gt; I said that no customer No customer wants selection No customer wants to buy house because it looks cool and &gt;&gt; Sitting here today, that the products that you sell &gt;&gt; What I can say is, we work they're safe. We have... We've spent $400 million in the out things that are not safe, millions of sellers and hundreds our job is to, as fast as we don't belong on our site. We're going to have to be vigilant as a retailer and as a definitely dedicated to, to customers. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We heard that concern for the customer over Amazon executives. &gt;&gt; Customer trust in a company like Amazon, it's sort of &gt;&gt; Customer obsession is the it, it's not a corporate slogan. &gt;&gt; We try to stay really focused on customers. &gt;&gt; Very focused on, on delivering results for our &gt;&gt; Providing a great customer &gt;&gt; Delivering that, that &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This commitment to prices low, had another benefit: afoul of regulators who enforce &gt;&gt; It's important to understand fundamental philosophies of You know, there's the you, you want to break up all power that you can. But for the last 30 years, there's been this change in how And this is the idea that the be to drive prices lower, to consumer. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Lynn had been urging regulators to take a more examine whether the company was exploitative ways: stifling fair low for consumers. &gt;&gt; We live in a society of consumers, though, and benefit to all of us when So, what's wrong with that view &gt;&gt; It's obviously good for we can drive down prices, if we have books that anybody could That's a good thing. It's a good thing for society, and it's a good thing for us as But we're not only consumers, We're also producers. We're also people who think and who make things and who grow access to open markets. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Once again, the tension was most pronounced Amazon was selling around 40% and two-thirds of all electronic the Kindle. Then, one of the world's largest publishers, Hachette, decided to Franklin Foer was one of its &gt;&gt; Hachette and Amazon set out contract. And Hachette said, &quot;No, we don't accept the terms of your And Amazon basically said, &quot;To We're going to stop delivering If somebody searches for a redirect them to another &gt;&gt; Amazon's battle with Hachette publishes is heating up. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Bezos's virtual blockade dragged on for months. &gt;&gt; A bitter, seven-month standoff... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Thousands of authors, including bestsellers caught in the middle. &gt;&gt; Some authors were losing 50% to 90% of their sales from It was absolutely devastating It actually destroyed their &gt;&gt; Did you see your &gt;&gt; I did, yes. I saw my sales plummet tremendously. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In frustration, Preston penned an open letter It was published in &quot;The New signatures. &gt;&gt; We authors have loved Amazon. We have enthusiastically they treat us? This is not right. &gt;&gt; Amazon has been accused of prices to deliberately delaying &gt;&gt; Is this what happens when muscles? &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Hachette and Amazon were at an impasse, and other authors went to administration to open an &gt;&gt; I went to the Justice Federal Trade Commission with to explain to them why this We pointed it out of all the bullying the publishing &gt;&gt; The Department of Justice And their answer was essentially popular companies in the (camera clicks) services to consumers, and And that we hadn't given them antitrust investigation. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Eventually, Hachette and Amazon would Amazon allowing Hachette to set offering it incentives to keep &gt;&gt; It's great to be here at (crowd cheering) during the Obama years, and 40% of all online commerce in &gt;&gt; Last year, during the busiest customers around the world Amazon every second. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But the complaints about its tactics would kinds concerned that Amazon had gatekeeper. &gt;&gt; You've got to be on Amazon.

And it could take a week, it could take months, it could be again. Amazon has the upper hand and the ability to basically take any given moment. &gt;&gt; Selling on Amazon, take one. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon said more than half of everything &gt;&gt; I sell mini-longboard &gt;&gt; I sell mineral water. This is what I do. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it's success-- proactively contacting risk of suspension and offering disputes. &gt;&gt; You already have great products. Scale up... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in the eyes of essentially become like the last century that controlled country. &gt;&gt; Start selling today. &gt;&gt; Do you see yourself for e-commerce, that sellers on your rails, through your &gt;&gt; I don't think of it that way, majority of stuff that's... Well, all of the stuff that's sold is manufactured, right? So it's manufactured, meaning there are brands and factories it. We're one percent of the retail sales in the world, about. &gt;&gt; Well, you are the biggest marketplace online, &gt;&gt; No, so, again, I, I don't... The idea that there's an online, distinct for brands to sell physical, just doesn't make the largest retailer. So, I, I describe this as retail, and we're competing Costco and Carrefour and Alibaba who are, are now selling both &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to retailers, inside the company schooled in how to talk about &gt;&gt; When I worked at Amazon, we use of terms like &quot;monopoly.&quot; We were not allowed to use a term like &quot;market share.&quot; Amazon has what's known as &quot;market segment share.&quot; What is market segment? What is market segment share? I don't know, but I know that the lawyers at Amazon feel those using terms like market share. &gt;&gt; So market share was something they were really &gt;&gt; Clearly somebody with the training recognized that Amazon when we were asked to use the &quot;market segment share,&quot; in saying, &quot;I'm not going to talk &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Since leaving Kaphan has been watching the concern, and he's speaking &gt;&gt; I think that the being a ruthless competitor is customer obsession, they can do be good for people who aren't &gt;&gt; I know you're not a basically concerned that Amazon &gt;&gt; I'm, I'm concerned that it I think it, you know, whether monopoly or not, I don't know. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That question has &gt;&gt; I think that Amazon is threat that they may face is It's whether or not in and intervene and say, &quot;You &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For years, Bezos profile in Washington. &gt;&gt; Amazon has been lobbying the F.A.A. to lift... &gt;&gt; Trying to cozy up to politicians, so that they will around... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spending millions a year on lobbying. &gt;&gt; Amazon lobbied more government entities than any &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And hiring as its press secretary Jay Carney. &gt;&gt; You've got an army of lobbyists, many of whom have government, including yourself. What are you hoping to get for all that lobbying spend and all &gt;&gt; One of the things we visibility of our company, but that we're in, we need safety, on transportation, on And also, we can be a resource, policymakers and regulators. It's not lobbying in the traditional sense, in terms of do something, it's just providing data and information. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos himself would also become a presence in the largest private residence in &gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos never really politics, but as he's cemented started to acquire this physical He bought a mansion, then is explicitly designed to be &gt;&gt; It has a big ballroom, I real presence for him in the hobnob with the people who make &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He'd even bought &gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos sent a thunderbolt week... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spending a quarter of a billion dollars to rescue Post.&quot; &gt;&gt; I do believe that democracy dies in darkness. I think that the capital city of the United States of America Washington Post.&quot; &gt;&gt; I got to say, you know, full credit to him, he hasn't coverage of the paper. And he's invested in the paper. Every dollar of profit that the making it a better paper. &gt;&gt; Bezos allowed the &quot;Post&quot; to hire, to restock its newsroom, atmosphere of sort of decline. I'd say &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has really flourished under, &gt;&gt; Let's cut this digital &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At the time, motive. &gt;&gt; Perhaps he's buying &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to buy some &gt;&gt; Precisely. &gt;&gt; This deal could give him more influence over politics. &gt;&gt; Nobody hangs out in Washington, DC, just to go to You buy a home in Washington, Washington, because it is the world, and you want to lay your business opportunity there, as The Obama administration planned government by embracing cloud Bezos had been quietly building business. He called it Amazon Web Services. &gt;&gt; It's basically computing power in the cloud, but really around the world that give technology services they need. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To keep Amazon running, Bezos had developed an infrastructure. He realized he could rent parts of it out, not just to government. &gt;&gt; Our infrastructure is built to satisfy the security risk-sensitive organizations. &gt;&gt; He's already got a huge edge over the other big competitors So he wants to take that lead &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2013, he got a revealed that Amazon Web computing cloud for the C.I.A. &gt;&gt; Amazon Web Services was awarded a ten-year contract for &gt;&gt; Amazon is helping the C.I.A. network... &gt;&gt; The C.I.A. contract was probably one of the best things business. It lifted all doubts about the security of the cloud and on with your most precious data. &gt;&gt; The message to the world is, &quot;If the C.I.A. trusts Amazon companies and government &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And they did. &gt;&gt; Experience it with Expedia. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A.W.S. became by cloud-computing platform. &gt;&gt; On CBS. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Today, more than a PBS, pay Amazon to &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos had again technology, and had made himself &gt;&gt; What Jeff Bezos is after is is the infrastructure, that owns commerce is done. And that's an incredibly powerful place to be. &gt;&gt; Please welcome chief Services Andy Jassy. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Andy Jassy created and runs A.W.S. He credits the service with making it easier to do business throughout the economy. &gt;&gt; Look at what A.W.S. has enabled with regard to change Look at, Netflix changed the way and Airbnb changed the way that and Grab and Lyft and Uber transportation. A.W.S. has enabled, has been a part of enabling all these huge consumer experiences that people. &gt;&gt; And we're the cloud with the most capabilities, the most &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The division last year. &gt;&gt; Amazon Web Services. &gt;&gt; Yes! &gt;&gt; Build On. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The success of expand Amazon from a company company that does everything. A top priority... &gt;&gt; To boldly go where no man has &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: ...was to create love with as a child. &gt;&gt; Gentlemen, this computer has an auditory sensor. It can, in effect, hear sounds. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A world of which computers can think and about humans. &gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos is a big fan of &quot;Star Trek.&quot; He, he admits that that was on his brain when he came up with pursuing a little disk that you &gt;&gt; Stop. &gt;&gt; This is his &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; fantasy realized. &gt;&gt; We started working on this device. And our, our vision was, in the long term, it would become the &gt;&gt; When it first arrived from was. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2014, Bezos's talking computer, the Amazon &gt;&gt; Is it for me? &gt;&gt; It's for everyone. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The voice known as into the lives of millions of &gt;&gt; Alexa, what do you do? &gt;&gt; I can play music, answer questions, get the news and &gt;&gt; They call it a personal implies this intimate connection with Amazon. &gt;&gt; Alexa, sing the ABC song. &gt;&gt; A, B, C, D, E, F... about the future and the future given where we currently are represents the moment that it with our lives. &gt;&gt; Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon? &gt;&gt; One tablespoon equals three teaspoons. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; And the problem is that we &gt;&gt; Alexa, lights on. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Alexa is also &gt;&gt; I'm answering questions and &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And that helps artificial intelligence. &gt;&gt; Alexa... &gt;&gt; Every time you ask Alexa Alexa algorithm better. It's one of the reasons why Amazon, having had a head start, head start, because they've got &gt;&gt; Alexa is one more way for valuable data. And this data collection is extremely important to this It's extremely hard to do, and, just deploy something like this trick. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dave Limp is Amazon's head of devices. &gt;&gt; How is it that you convinced tens of millions of essentially a, a listening &gt;&gt; Well, I, I would first It doesn't, it's not a The, the device in its core It has a detector on it. We call it internally a &quot;wake-word engine.&quot; And that detector is listening-- not really thing and one thing only, which want to get the attention of &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Once the device is it's recording. And last year, it was revealed that Amazon employs thousands of listen and transcribe some of the system. &gt;&gt; Do you think that you did a good enough job of That, that there are humans recordings? &gt;&gt; We, we try to articulate what we're doing with our products as But if I could go back in time, the team could be more clear, on to annotate a small percentage What I would say, though, is customers didn't clearly couple of days, we added an customers could turn off chose. And then within a month or two later, we allowed people to also asked for within that, You know, we're not going to make mistakes, I think the key quickly on behalf of customers. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But even one of the founders of Amazon Web Services with caution. &gt;&gt; When do you turn off your Alexa? &gt;&gt; I turn off my Alexa when I know for a fact that the have, or, or whenever I just I don't want certain humans, conversations that I that should not be shared, then particular listening devices. &gt;&gt; We have had an incredible year. The team has invented a lot on behalf of customers, and I have. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: So far, Limp and his team have made Alexa 100,000 products. &gt;&gt; Echo Frames allow you to get done more around you and be more &gt;&gt; Now they're going to know knows.

(oven beeps) &gt;&gt; All these intimacies, all integrated, analyzed and &gt;&gt; Alexa, alarm off. &gt;&gt; That is an extraordinary kind of power that has never before &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After Alexa, Amazon billion dollars to buy Ring... &gt;&gt; Hey, bud, the police are on the way. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A doorbell camera and app that Amazon describes as &gt;&gt; Hey, get away! &gt;&gt; Get out of there! &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To promote it, hundreds of local police &gt;&gt; It's a phenomenal tool to &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They give them footage and have given free talking points. &gt;&gt; This system is so simple to use... &gt;&gt; You have Amazon in partnership with police turned policemen into, like, Ring. They have given police departments talking points and the installation of Ring by None of this was public &gt;&gt; And this is Ring's first It is... cute, is what I would &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon has of Ring. Last fall, Dave Limp unveiled a version designed to monitor the Within weeks, hackers discovered customers. &gt;&gt; Did you see that video? &gt;&gt; I did see that video. &gt;&gt; What did you think of &gt;&gt; I think that that is a It's not just about the, a Ring anybody's cameras. It's about any device in that... And we've already investigated the root cause was. What we want to be able to do in those cases is, we want to We'd like to detect them. And we also want to build tools that give them the ability so it harder for those kinds of There's a lot of bad people in &gt;&gt; Here's a device that seems harmless, and I'm just straight with people about the customers that you are obsessed &gt;&gt; Well, it's not supposedly, we I, I would say that we are features at every level of the authentication, fraud detection. We offer things that customers can turn on that make it even, attacks to happen. &gt;&gt; Yo, what's up, how's your day? &gt;&gt; Who is that? &gt;&gt; What's going on, buddy? What are you watching? &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There were a series country. &gt;&gt; What's up, homie? I still see you. &gt;&gt; You hungry? &gt;&gt; What's going on, my main man &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it's not just Ring has fired some of its own customers. &gt;&gt; In George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; he describes a dystopia did live from habit that became every sound you made was And I wonder if you ever think become dystopian to some degree? &gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to live in that world. So, I do not want to invent the technology that, or have my would create that world. And so... but I am an optimist. I, I think if you take the, the wouldn't invent anything. &gt;&gt; We're increasingly living in a world in which your there. Do, can you see how it could be concerning in some ways that we at this point? &gt;&gt; Oh, sure, I can see why it could be concerning to some Our job in building that such a way that it, that it scenarios that you just talked can. You know, the, the reality of it is, that world happened way that Bezos himself wrestled with &gt;&gt; I believe that privacy is issues of the 21st century. The thing is, there are towns now in the United States that on every corner, and their but do you really want cameras There are very strange things the next 100 years with respect challenge us as a society to with privacy. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Decades later, Bezos would be at the vanguard kind of technology. &gt;&gt; Introducing Amazon Rekognition Video. &gt;&gt; Rekognition allows you to pass an image to us. You can say, &quot;Do these two faces match?&quot; Which is incredibly useful for applications in the security You can imagine... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After Amazon rolled out a facial recognition tool, enforcement. &gt;&gt; Recognize and track persons of interest from a collection &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Police we've spoken identify suspects quickly. &gt;&gt; ...appears to be a match, but I'm gonna make sure I look at &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And while Amazon it should be used, there are few technology. &gt;&gt; It returns anybody with warrants that look like her. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Civil liberties advocates have raised concerns, worry Amazon has released the that police are essentially on behalf of the company. &gt;&gt; The tools are not what I call battle-tested. And we still do not understand how well they work in the applied. That's where I see a danger. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Anima Anandkumar artificial intelligence at In her first interview about her particularly alarmed by an software prone to mistakes with Amazon has questioned the &gt;&gt; As a researcher in A.I., I responsibility to educate the today, right? Because they hear so much of A.I. being hyped up, you know, it's supposed to solve all the I see the potential in doing need a reality check. We need to ask, where is A.I. today? What can it truly do well? &gt;&gt; And when it comes to think it's ready for primetime. &gt;&gt; I don't think face recognition is ready for applications like law &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Anandkumar and Amazon to stop selling because they say the system's and there are no clear We asked Andy Jassy about it. &gt;&gt; I have a different view, and we've spent... We've had the facial recognition technology out for years now. And in those two-and-a-half years, we've never had any enforcement using the facial know, I think a lot of societal facial recognition technology. Already, you've seen hundreds of missing kids reunited with their trafficking victims saved, and identity and education uses, so been done with it. But I also understand that it could be misused. And I think at the end of the day with any technology, whether recognition technology or use the technology have to be use it irresponsibly, they have &gt;&gt; There's been all in this country. So why allow police departments to experiment? &gt;&gt; We believe that governments and the organizations that are communities safe have to have sophisticated, modern We don't have a large number of using our facial recognition we've never received any Let's see if somehow they abuse They haven't done that, and to and therefore you shouldn't most sophisticated technology right balance to me. &gt;&gt; It's been difficult to even know how many police recognition technology, and know whether there are How would the public ever know? &gt;&gt; You know, again, I don't think we know the total number using facial recognition I mean, there's, you can use any our technology infrastructure in whatever conjunction, any We know of some, and the vast it are using it according to the And when they're not, we have that they're using it in some allow them to use the service Bezos have said they want regulate how law enforcement can But in the meantime, Amazon has discussed its services with Enforcement. &gt;&gt; At Amazon Web Services... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And the U.S. &gt;&gt; ...partner community to defense leaders for when it &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos himself has Amazon playing a critical role in commerce. &gt;&gt; We are going to continue to support the D.O.D., and I think And if big tech companies are U.S. Department of Defense, this &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Amazon has after another, Jeff Bezos's proportions. &gt;&gt; You've called what Jeff Bezos has built a miracle. &gt;&gt; Absolute miracle.

I kinda think that in, like, ten years Jeff Bezos owns every &gt;&gt; So Amazon has these Darth look at a sector and begin even touching it. Amazon can begin beating competitors without even &gt;&gt; You actually think effect on competition in the &gt;&gt; I think it's a mixed bag, I there's evidence that they have sectors.

We couldn't even imagine that. But Amazon does it, and people (explosion echoes) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon is investing movies. &gt;&gt; Oh.

(audience laughing) &gt;&gt; Bezos likes to joke about Globe... shoes. And it does that in a very direct way, because when members, they, they buy more on and one of the reasons they do annual fee, they're looking more value out of the program?&quot; &gt;&gt; They're trying to use this entertainment to get people into &gt;&gt; Alexa, play &quot;Jack Ryan&quot; on &gt;&gt; To keep them sitting within where it becomes this unthinking all these parts of our &gt;&gt; So you're doing the media more of Prime. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; Amazon is represented at the Amazon is the first streaming Picture. &gt;&gt; He's like one of the old studio bosses right now. He really enjoys having this place in the industry and the center of attention there. &gt;&gt; I also want you to know, Jeff, if you win tonight, you in two to five business days... &gt;&gt; What you see now is someone confident. A guy who has become a titan. bigger. It's looking for another home in North America. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos and Amazon's soaring stature would be on full the company announced a contest headquarters. &gt;&gt; ...called HQ2. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They promised $5 &gt;&gt; $5 billion... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And 50,000 jobs. &gt;&gt; 50,000... &gt;&gt; 50,000 people. &gt;&gt; 50,000 high-paying jobs. &gt;&gt; Cities are salivating over &gt;&gt; It was unprecedented because shoulders more than had ever This was a super-high-profile consumer company in the, in the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The company invited pitch themselves. &gt;&gt; How about, I don't know, here? &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: 238 took them up on it. &gt;&gt; I chose, Miami-- you should, too. &gt;&gt; Can't wait to see you, Amazon. &gt;&gt; I, Ebenezer Scrooge... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some with &gt;&gt; ...I live in Atlanta. &gt;&gt; Amazon is demonstrating that it has the power to get to remake their workday and bow &gt;&gt; I'm Mark Bound, mayor of the &gt;&gt; And offer it huge tax breaks. &gt;&gt; Georgia offered $2 billion. &gt;&gt; Maryland offered $5 billion. &gt;&gt; $7 billion from New Jersey. &gt;&gt; Huge infrastructure promises, &gt;&gt; Philadelphia is offering the feet. &gt;&gt; They know that these places all don't have a prayer. &gt;&gt; So to those who saw it as a kind of grotesque dangle 50,000 jobs and potential over metropolitan cities around &gt;&gt; Look, I, I think, I used to government, like, we want United States. States want businesses to invest in states, cities, city invest in cities. The proposals we got, the cities made the proposals, they wanted to us why they were an Amazon announced there were two and New York City. &gt;&gt; This is by far the biggest New York City, the history of &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: New York City and it, offering up nearly $3 tax breaks. &gt;&gt; I'll change my name to &quot;Amazon Cuomo&quot; if that's what it &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In return, Amazon of dollars in capital of projects earmarked for local &gt;&gt; I thought it could be a great We are more and more of a tech that reality. Having Amazon here would have helped immensely. &gt;&gt; Amazon has got to go! &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But not everyone billions in tax breaks to a &gt;&gt; Corporate handout! &gt;&gt; Get out! &gt;&gt; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says (gavel pounding) hearing on the deal... &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Though the deal had already been finalized, the New public hearing. It quickly turned contentious. &gt;&gt; Mr. Husman, you mentioned that are currently working here that correct? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Council members their position on unions, and pledge to remain neutral if to unionize. &gt;&gt; How many of those employees are unionized? &gt;&gt; None, sir. &gt;&gt; None. Would you be okay with agreeing to neutrality so that workers &gt;&gt; No, sir, we respect... &gt;&gt; You wouldn't agree to that. &gt;&gt; Correct, sir, we would not. &gt;&gt; To go to a city council hearing, as Amazon did, and they wanted to start a fight, If they wanted to actually show with this community and our &gt;&gt; You are in a union city. And one of the first answers to your question today, is-- would That is not a way to come to our &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was not the when it launched the contest. Two weeks later, Amazon pulled out. &gt;&gt; Amazon is pulling the plug on its New York plans. &gt;&gt; We decided we didn't have to be there in that political The fact of the matter is, when the mayor supporting something persuade other critics that it for New York to make, we elsewhere. &gt;&gt; He said to us that it turned out that the governor and wasn't enough to persuade other kind of investment for New York So we decided... we decided it's &gt;&gt; That's an idiotic statement That is pure idiocy from a guy better. The deal was done, Amazon knew it was done. There was noise, there was posturing by people in the was done, so all we're talking noise. In what world are there no critics? Well, yeah, in an autocratic totalitarian world, maybe that's the world that Jeff Bezos is entitled to. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At the time, Bezos turmoil. &gt;&gt; Amazon C.E.O. Jeff Bezos and his wife of 25 years &gt;&gt; The announcement coming amid now in a relationship with Sanchez. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; had been pursuing him &gt;&gt; The tabloid claims it tracked 40,000 miles. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos saw the &quot;Enquirer's&quot; report as &gt;&gt; So what would be the motive embarrassing material about the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;? Who would want to get the dirt in the press? &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The magazine's owner, David Pecker, was linked how they were covered by Bezos's The first was President Trump. &gt;&gt; It's put there for the benefit of &quot;The Washington &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The second: Saudi Salman, who the C.I.A. had tied &quot;Post's&quot; journalists, Jamal &gt;&gt; Former C.I.A. director John that Saudi Arabia would want to him financially.&quot; &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: David Pecker demanded that Bezos publicly coverage was not politically intimate photos of him. &gt;&gt; Breaking news tonight, a stunner from the richest man in &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Rather than give &gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos calling out the Enquirer,&quot; David Pecker. &gt;&gt; Bezos published a personal account accusing the &quot;National extortion. &gt;&gt; He turned the situation around and handled it so transparent, he was very embarrassing things about and positioned the other kicked the bully in the nuts, net positive. I mean, this really was the PR strategy and execution of the I've never seen anything like pushed ahead undaunted-- a And even after a $38 billion richest person on the planet. (cheers and applause) But the calls to rein in his &gt;&gt; Amazon reported $10 billion taxes. &gt;&gt; I will single out companies like Halliburton or Amazon that need to change that. &gt;&gt; Here's Bezos achieving this American dream and success. And, and he's now the target of, of all of this criticism. And basically, it becomes a symbol of all of his problems. &gt;&gt; Amazon is closing 30% of America's stores and malls and &gt;&gt; You're basically a pinata politician with a populist Anyone who wants to talk about pointing their finger at you. &gt;&gt; This is why three people own more wealth than the bottom &gt;&gt; If they want to talk about general, they're pointing their &gt;&gt; We need to enforce our giant companies. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it's coming from all sides. &gt;&gt; President Trump just sent a chill down the spine of Jeff &gt;&gt; The president again teed off &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: President Trump has Washington Post&quot; a regular &gt;&gt; &quot;Washington Post,&quot; Bezos uses &gt;&gt; He kind of assumed that &quot;The the sort of way that he would And so he thought that Bezos was &quot;Post,&quot; which we should be &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Trump has also the company of evading taxes. Last year, the company was competing for a $10 billion the Department of Defense. &gt;&gt; This contract would have solidified Bezos's dominance in This is a hugely important &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But the company intervened to scuttle the deal. &gt;&gt; And we're looking at it very seriously. It's a very big contract. One of the biggest ever given. &gt;&gt; A big win for Microsoft, beating out Amazon... &gt;&gt; Amazon can protest the outcome, especially given the by President Trump... &gt;&gt; It's an extraordinary times we live in that one of the Amazon, is now saying, &quot;The has corrupted our ability to win &gt;&gt; Is there any evidence &gt;&gt; The evidence is what the &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And Amazon's multiply. The Federal Trade Commission is now reconsidering its stance on looking at Amazon-- as are &gt;&gt; This gatekeeper power and how is of tremendous concern. &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In Washington, Democratic Congressman David antitrust investigation into by Amazon and the other tech &gt;&gt; Given your experience, do you suggesting that it seeks to act independent sellers? &gt;&gt; I disagree with that. We get, I don't know, what I smile. &gt;&gt; We were able to get several C.E.Os. to come to a public That required tremendous courage for economic retaliation for &gt;&gt; We don't have the resources We could use some help. &gt;&gt; In the course of your investigation thus far, and hearings, have you seen any behavior by Amazon? &gt;&gt; Um, we have seen evidence of anti-competitive behavior by all result of their market But it sort of doesn't fall on problem. It falls on us. Without objection, the hearing &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Cicilline's everything from imposing limits like Amazon can engage in, to use of data. The man who helped Jeff Bezos it may be necessary to go even &gt;&gt; On the one hand, I'm proud of scares me. And, um, I just feel like it's important for someone in my say what they think about what's &gt;&gt; This is sort of in birth to, right? And so, I mean, you helped birth Amazon. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, very much so. In fact, I used to, um, you during the night to, just to see you know, take care of it if it &gt;&gt; And when you look at today, you see what? &gt;&gt; (chuckles) Well, um... you know, you offspring, um, become, um, So I think not all of the world are for the best and, And, you know, I, I wish it and I... but I had something to existence, so, it's partly on &gt;&gt; And, I mean, isn't... Isn't this just capitalism? Isn't this just a company doing &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, it is, um, and I think they're doing what the business they're doing it aggressively intelligence. And they will continue to do that unless they're constrained &gt;&gt; There are proposals Is that something you'd promote, &gt;&gt; Um, I think that they're now potentially make sense. &gt;&gt; How do you and Jeff and others at the senior call to break you guys up? &gt;&gt; We don't think about it very, very deeply. You know, I've been at Amazon now for 22-and-a-half years, the first things I heard Jeff fit the whole company in just all-hands meeting. He said, &quot;I would not go to bed at night fearing your external issues. I would go to bed at night fearing whether you're doing And that really is a credo that spend most of our time thinking &gt;&gt; Well, I, I understand that deserve scrutiny, and I think large in the economy and in The problem is, when you think verticals, yes. There's... there's video, and there's commerce, and there's, there are all these things. But in every one of them, we have intense competition, and I in a lot of them, it can seem global... If we were everywhere, that means we're talking about the retail-- it's so vast, we're &gt;&gt; To the public, it may Amazon, which is a company with market cap, your C.E.O. is the Jeff Wilke said to me that the scheme of things. Do you see how that could seem strange or incongruous? &gt;&gt; You know, Amazon as a whole has become, you know, has been the company's been successful in segments doesn't mean it's company is coming under ever everything from how it wields environment-- he's continuing to &gt;&gt; We get to preserve this completely irreplaceable. There is no plan B. We have to save this planet, and for our grandchildren's growth. We can have both. Who is gonna do this work? (rocket rumbling) &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He's spending a personal fortune on a space &gt;&gt; And it's this generation's so that the future generations &gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For Bezos, it's vision for the future. &gt;&gt; I want you to think about this. This vision sounds very big, and it is. None of this is easy, all of it is hard, but I want to inspire Big things start small. (audience applauding) Thank you.
