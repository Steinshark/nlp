And also subscribe to Alan Becker. Hes a really good animator. I Pitched in too! (Noah Badgley) Just noticed a few spelling errors here and there and thought I could do what I could, and I sprinkled in some creative jucies as well. Full Credit to NathanTubeHD though. He carried the bulk of the load and took time out of his day to make em. Great job. (sorry the last text box was so big.) Have a good day and Thanks for Watching!
