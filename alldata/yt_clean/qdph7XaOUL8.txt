Does that wall look weird to you? Yep, we've got a spy on our hands. Don't worry, we'll show you all our sneaky Watcha doin' there, Sophia? Aw, cute! OOF! What'd you do, rob the library? I'm just trying to prep for the test tomorrow! I totally forgot about that! I'm such a dummy. Well, all hope's not lost yet. Hey! What are you doing to my glasses? There! Now do you see the solution? YEAH! Don't have x-ray vision? This hack is the next best thing! That's because with red lenses, You can't see red ink on paper! Why study when you have these bad boys? Thanks, Eva! Huh? What kind of weird glasses are those? Trying to start a new fashion trend, huh? Let me see what the fuss is about. That's a lot of red. Okay. Phew! Now back to work I go! Ooh! It's four-fourteen already! Bye! And I was like, is that a real dog? Catcha ya later! That was sure abrupt. Four-fourteen again? I gotta run. Bye! Bye! Yep, four-fourteen! That's so odd. Whew, that was rough. Sophia's home? What's this? WAHHH!! Yikes! I wonder where she goes every day? I'll just track where she goes with this! Drop it in before she comes back. And another day gone! I'll catch you later, okay? Let the tracking begin! Now I get to sit back and watch. Woah, she's moving quick! I'm finally getting to the bottom of this. But I've gotta be discreet. Game on. My phone says she's nearby. I'm just gonna take some quick pics. Yes! Got her! Is that a book? Uh-oh... We've been spotted! I should probably get outta here! When I'm gone, do not go in here under any circumstances. Is that clear? Gotcha, Sophia. Have a safe trip! Why's she so protective over that room? I definitely smell something! Yep, it's definitely coming from here! Is it a candle? Or maybe perfume? Nope, it's this big bowl of sweets!! They're just gonna be sitting here. And boy, do they smell delicious! Think she'd notice if I took one? No, Eva, no! Oh, we're not that close anyway. They taste just as good as they smell! They still look the same, right? I'd better get outta here! OOF! I brought back way too many souvenirs! Time to unpack, I guess! Phew! It's hot in here. Are there still 16 pieces in here? GAH! Who's been in here?! That's it. I'm checking for fingerprints! To do this, you'll need some clear plastic. Then trace the head of a flashlight on it. Once that's done, Color it in with a blue marker. Cut it out and tape it to the flashlight. Then do the same with red. Tape them down and you're ready! Hit the lights, please! Muahahaha! Are there any fingerprints here? Just as I thought! Someone had their grubby fingers on my stuff! Oh gosh. EVA! Okay, lipstick's on, and it's selfie time! Be cute! We may not even need a filter! Woah, look at Sophia... What is wrong with my face?! You can't post these... NOOOO!!!! What's done is done, girl. At least I look cute though. Oh man, I'm really tired. I'll just rest my eyes for a few minutes. Here's my chance to set things straight! You asleep? Now lemme take this for one second... Phew. Oh no, the pass code! I can't get in! But Eva can. I think I know what to do! And this lipstick is just the ticket. Simply rub it over your friend's fingertip, Then imprint it on a pice of tape. Nice. Now I just have to make the transfer. Simply press it on like this. And use it to get into the phone! Ha! Sucker! Her insta's about to blow up! Here's your phone back! Ah, it sure feels good being bad. Ahhh. Did I fall asleep? I wonder how many likes I got! Huh? Did you do this, Sophia?! Some friend you are! Looks like movie night over here! Uh-oh, last chip alert! Sorry, you understand, right? It's Sophia's phone. Who texted her? Let's see what it says, shall we? Ugh, how mean is that?! Fresh bowl of chips coming right up! Gah! Thank goodness Eva didn't see this! What's she up to now? Hey, sorry, I can talk now. What is she saying? I can barely hear a thing! This is so unfair. Hey! This cup outta help! Hmmm... I still can't really hear anything! Stupid cup. On second thought... Take a deflated balloon and cut off the end. Now stretch it over the top of the cup. Perfect. Now let's see if we can hear her. WHA!! What are you doing?! Hey! My package has finally arrived! Huh? Oh! Hello? Yes, tell me everything! Time for a little hot water refill. Is this Sophia's package? Yep. It has her name on it. Is it hallow? Doesn't really sound like anything. I give up. It's not even her birthday. Huh? I know! Did you know steam can loosen glue? I didn't even have to tear it! Ooh, it's a letter! It's from her grandma? Aw, that's awfully nice. But Sophia can't know I opened this! I'll just seal it and leave it here. Hey Eva!
