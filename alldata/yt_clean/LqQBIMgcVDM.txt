HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS TONIGHT WE HAVE SEAN CARROLL, THEORETICAL TECHNOLOGY, TALKING ABOUT THE MANY WORLDS TONIGHT IS A SPECIAL OCCASION. IT IS THE FIRST LECTURE SINCE THE TRAGIC DEATH NELSON. SO WE WILL START WITH A TRIBUTE TO HER BY GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS STEVE SHARP I AM A PROFESSOR IN BEFORE WE START WITH THE LECTURE TONIGHT, THE TRAGIC LOSS OF OUR COLLEAGUE, WHO DIED AND WAS ONE OF THE MOST HIGHLY ESTEEMED MEMBERS AS INDICATED BY HER NUMEROUS AWARDS SOME OF SHE WAS AWARDED THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL SOCIETYS YEAR. THIS IS THE HIGHEST AWARD GIVEN BY THE AMERICAN ANN WAS A BRILLIANT PARTICLE PHYSICIST WHO IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS AND COSMOLOGY. I DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO GO INTO IT, I HAVE DARK MATTER, DARK ENERGY. I DO WANT TO SAY SHE LIKED COMING UP WITH DARK ENERGY FOR MASS FEARING NEUTRINOS, MAVENS. SHE WAS A MAVEN HERSELF. SOMEONE WHO HAD DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF PARTICLE THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT MOTIVATE PARTICLE SHE WAS GOOD AT TRYING TO ANSWER THEM. BETTER THAN MOST OF US. SHE WAS A MASTER AT COMING UP WITH THEORETICAL IN A WAY THAT LED TO EXPERIMENT CONSEQUENCES. SO AS WE SAY SHE WAS A THEORETICAL MODEL BUILDER. AND I WOULD SAY WITHOUT PEER, WORLDWIDE. ANN WAS PASSIONATE NOT ONLY ABOUT PHYSICS AND FLOWERS, THE OUTDOORS. HERE I HAVE A BLURRY PICTURE FROM 1992 OF ON TOP OF MOUNT RAINIER. WE DID MANY HIKES TOGETHER. SHE WAS ALSO PASSIONATE ABOUT TEACHING. SHE WAS AN AWARD-WINNING TEACHER. ABOUT MENTORING SHE MEN TOWARD MANY STUDENTS. GRADUATE STUDENTS AND POST DOCS TO BECOME AND IN GENERAL, SHE LOVED BRINGING THE JOY HE OR SHE IS TEACHING PALESTINIAN STUDENTS. IN THE WEST BANK. IN PARTICULAR, ESPECIALLY OVER THE LAST FEW STEPS TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY FACULTY, STUDENT BODY AND MORE GENERALLY OUR EXHORTING US ALL TO FOLLOW AND LEADING US I CANNOT DO JUSTICE IN THE SHORT TIME TO ALL BUT I WANT TO SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS DISCUSSION SHE WAS AND SHE WAS PROBABLY THE SHE NEVER BETRAYED A HINT OF ARROGANCE. SHE JUST WANTED TO LEARN, WANTED OTHER PEOPLE SHE WAS WARM, CARING PERSON, A FRIEND TO ME SHE WAS JUST AN AMAZING PERSON. OVERALL SHE WAS AN INSPIRATION TO ALL OF US IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT ANN, HER OBITUARIES TODAY AND ALSO THE MOUNTAINEERS TO SHOW THE AN AMAZING PERSON. TO CELEBRATE ANN 'S LEGACY AND HONOR HER ACHIEVEMENTS, A PROFESSORSHIP OF PHYSICS. THE DOCTOR ANN NELSON PROFESSORS OF PHYSICS. INDIVIDUALS COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY RELATED AND SERVICE REFLECTS THE COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY IN PHYSICS. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER DONATING TO THIS I AM SURE THE SLIDES WILL BE MADE LIFE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. [ APPLAUSE ] THE GOAL OF THE FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS LECTURE SEAN CARROLL, TO GIVE FREE LECTURES TO THE IN PHYSICS. WE AIM TO SHARE WITH YOU HERE, IN SEATTLE, TO DESCRIBE NATURE ON THE MORE FUNDAMENTAL IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE BY THE LECTURE SERIES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW SERIES, AND THE ENDOWED PROFESSORSHIP OF DETERMINE PLEASE REACH OUT TO ME FOLLOWING THE LECTURE WE HOUSE THE FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS LECTURE BY UWTV POSTED ONLINE AFTER THE LECTURE FOR OUR SPEAKER TONIGHT IS SEAN CARROLL, THEORETICAL HE OBTAINED HIS PhD AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, OF CHICAGO BEFORE MOVING TO CALTECH IN 2006. HE IS AN EXPERT IN EMERGENT PHENOMENON CONVEXITY, TIME AND QUANTUM MECHANICS USABILITY AMERICAN AWARDS INCLUDING RECENTLY FROM THE AMERICAN FELLOWSHIP. HE HAS AUTHORED 100 PUBLICATIONS, MOST OF SIX BOOKS INCLUDING A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER, DEEPLY HIDDEN: QUANTUM WORLDS AND THE EMERGENCE 's CONTRIBUTIONS TO CULTURE INCLUDE CONSULTING MAKING AND POST THE POTS CAP, WEDNESDAY. IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO INTRODUCE TO YOU DR. SEAN CARROLL. [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS. I'M A THEORETICAL PHYSICIST. IT WORKS. GREAT TO BE BACK HERE IN SEATTLE AT UW, ONE TO VISIT. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS. I'VE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS. MY PUBLISHER SAYS I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU YOU ARE ALLOWED TO ASK WHY THE WORLD WOULD THERE ARE ENOUGH BOOKS ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS. AS PART OF THE RESEARCH I DID FOR MY BOOK INTO THE SEARCH BAR AND YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THERE'S QUANTUM PHYSICS HER BABY, A WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP, QUANTUM YOGA, QUANTUM TOUCH, QUANTUM NONE OF THESE BOOKS ARE REALLY ABOUT QUANTUM WHY IS THAT? PART OF IT IS BECAUSE QUANTUM MECHANICS IS FILTERED INTO POPULAR IMAGINATION WAYS PROFESSIONAL BUT ALSO BECAUSE PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIST OF BOTH IN TERMS OF EXPLAINING QUANTUM MECHANICS WE GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION, ALL THESE PEOPLE WE GIVE THE PEOPLE, I WILL TRY TO REMEMBER WE GIVE PEOPLE THE IMPRESSION THAT NOT ONLY IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND. FUNDAMENTALLY MYSTERIOUS SO I DON'T USUALLY THIS AND SINCE I'M TALKING ABOUT A FACT ABOUT OF PHYSICS, LET ME LEAN ON THIS GUY, WHO FAMOUSLY QUANTUM MECHANICS AND I WROTE A RECENT PIECE QUANTUM MECHANICS AND REMARKABLY ONLY TWO QUANTUM MECHANICS PERFECTLY WELL. SORRY ONLY TWO PROFESSIONAL PHYSICIST WROTE LOTS OF OTHERS WROTE IN. OF COURSE IT MAYBE TRUE THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL BUT THE REST OF THE FIELD DOES NOT INC. THEY AS A FIELD WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND QUANTIC MECHANICS AND THAT'S FINE. IT'S FINE NOT TO UNDERSTAND THINGS. SCIENCE IS DRIVEN BY NOT UNDERSTANDING THINGS THIS. WHAT IS NOT FINE IS IN THE CASE OF QUANTUM WE USE QUANTUM MECHANICS ALL THE TIME. USE THE PREDICTIONS OF QUANTUM McADAMS TO , DISCOVER PARTICLES, BUILD THEORIES OF THE OTHER APPLICATIONS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS. BUT WE ARE USING QUANTUM MECHANICS IN THE YOU CAN TEXT AND TAKE PICTURES, READ E-MAIL WHEN THAT HAPPENS, I DON'T KNOW. THAT IS WHAT HE MEANS WHEN WE DON'T TRULY IS, NOT ONLY DO WE NOT TRY TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM THERE WAS A TIME IN THE 1920s AND 30s WHEN THING TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS. GIVEN HOW CENTRAL QUANTUM MECHANICS IS TO TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS WOULD CONSTITUTE RIGHT? THE PEOPLE BEST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND QUANTUM STOLEN AWAY BY MAJOR UNIVERSITIES, LURED WITH INSTEAD, THEY ARE KICKED OUT. GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE TOLD NOT TO DO THIS THEY SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO THINK ABOUT QUANTUM IT IS TOO BAD YOU LOVE SERIOUS WORK BEHIND. IN OTHER WORDS THE WAY I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT FABLES ABOUT THE FOX AND THE GRAPES , THE LOOK REALLY GOOD THE FOX JUMPS UP TO GET THE QUITE REACH THE GRAPES SO HE SAYS YOU KNOW THEY WERE PROBABLY SOUR. JUST TO SPELL OUT THE TERMS OF THE METAPHOR, UNDERSTANDING QUANTUM MECHANICS. WE TRIED FOR A WHILE, DIDN'T WORK SO WE DECIDED THAT WASN'T OUR JOB. I THINK THAT IS WRONG. I THINK IT IS THE JOB OF PHYSICS TO UNDERSTAND PHILOSOPHICAL , WE SHOULD STILL PUT EFFORT LET'S SEE HOW FAR WE CAN GET. I NEED TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT QUANTUM IS AT THE CENTER OF ALL WE DO IN MODERN PHYSICS. IT IS ABSOLUTELY PART OF OUR BEST UNDERSTANDING I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT IS MYSTERIOUS, SPOOKY WEIRD FROM OUR EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE. LET ME TREES THROUGH A VERY RATIONALIZED, WEIRDNESS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS. YOU HAVE ALL SEEING PICTURES LIKE THIS. THIS IS THE RUTHERFORD ADAM, A PICTURE PUT CENTURY WERE RATHER THAN AN ATOM BEING A SMOOTH IN THE CENTER AND SOMETHING CALLED THE NUCLEUS MADE UP PROTONS AND NEUTRONS, THEY WEREN'T A NUCLEUS AND THE ELECTRON, MUCH LIGHTER THAN AROUND IN A PICTURE LIKE THIS IT KIND OF LOOKS THE ROLE OF THE SUN AND ELECTRONS LOOK LIKE THIS WAS FORCED ON US BY THE DATA RUTHERFORD USUALLY THEY WENT RIGHT THROUGH BUT SOMETIMES HE DEDUCED, BECAUSE IT IS VERY SMART, THAT IN THE MIDDLE CALLED THE NUCLEUS. THE PROBLEM IS, THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT. THE RULES OF PHYSICS AS WE UNDERSTOOD THEM TOGETHER BY ISAAC NEWTON IN THE 1600S. ACCORDING TO CLASSICAL MECHANICS THERE ARE AND FROM KNOWING THAT YOU CAN FIGURE OUT EVERYTHING YOU APPLY THE RULES OF CLASSICAL MECHANICS YOU SEE ELECTRONS ORBITING AROUND , VERY QUICKLY IF YOU TAKE AN ELECTRON, THE THING ABOUT THE OUT AWAY FROM IT. IF YOU MOVE THE ELECTRON A LITTLE BIT, THE IF YOU TAKE THE ELECTRON AND MOVE IT UP AND WE CALL THESE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES OR LIGHT. LITERALLY ALL OF THE LIGHT YOU SEE IN THIS UP AND DOWN. HERE YOU HAVE ELECTRONS MOVING UP AND DOWN. MAYBE THE MOVE IN CIRCLES BUT THEY ARE STILL THEY SHOULD BE GIVING OFF LIGHT. THEY SHOULD BE GIVING OFF ELECTROMAGNETIC YOU CAN CALCULATE HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE YOU CAN ASSIGN THIS TO UNDERGRADUATES IF YOU IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR THE ELECTRONS, ACCORDING LIGHT. ENERGY IS CONSERVED, ELECTRONS GIVE OFF LIGHT . THE ORBIT OF AN ELECTRON AROUND THE NUCLEUS MECHANICS. AND YOUR UNDERGRADUATES WILL GET THE ANSWER FOR A TYPICAL ATOM TO SPIRAL INTO THE NUCLEUS. THAT IS A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE CAN DO THE EXPERIMENT. READY, IT DIDN'T WORK . IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. ATOMS ARE ACTUALLY STABLE IF CLASSIC MECHANICS WOULD COLLAPSE TO A POINT. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN SO THERE IS SOMETHING WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO USE WE REALLY STRUGGLE QUANTUM MECHANICS. IT DIDN'T JUST POP OUT LIKE VENUS FROM THE WE ARE FORCED TO INVENT THESE PARTICULAR IDEAS. AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE NOTICED THAT LIGHT, HAD PARTICLE LIKE PROPERTIES. HERE IS AN ELECTRON, A PARTICLE. MAYBE THE ELECTRON HAS WAVE LIKE PROPERTIES. AND THAT ACTUALLY WORKED. IF YOU SAY THE ELECTRON IS NOT A PARTICLE, DID NOT WASTE THEIR BRAIN BRAINPOWER COMING FUNCTION . IF YOU THINK OF THE ELECTRON AS SHAPES, THEN THAT WAVE FUNCTION CAN SETTLE SHAPES THE ELECTRON COULD HAVE ORBITING A IT WILL JUST STAY THERE FOREVER. IT WILL NOT SPIRAL INTO THE CENTER. YOU CAN EXPLAIN WHY ATOM ARE STABLE IF YOU THERE BUT WE DID EVENTUALLY GET THERE IF YOU PARTICLES, THEY ARE ACTUALLY WAVES. THAT SOUNDED PRETTY GOOD . PHYSICISTS ARE I KNOW WE HAVE A QUIZ AFTERWARD, OF WHICH THIS IS THE EQUATION THE CAME ALONG THEREAFTER, STATE OF THE ART HERE IS WE ARE IMAGINING NOT PARTICLES AT ALL, THEY ARE WAVES AND THEY YOU DON'T NEED TO KNOW THE DETAILS OF THE HERE IS ERWIN SCHRODINGER HE SAYS THIS IS BEHAVE. HOW THEY EVOLVE OVER TIME. SOLUTIONS TO THAT EQUATION WOULD GIVE YOU SHAPES. YOU ON WAVE FUNCTION CAN HAVE IN AN ATOM FOR YOU CAN USE THIS EQUATION AND MAKE PREDICTIONS CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THEY COULD SETTLE THIS MAKES PHYSICISTS VERY HAPPY WHEN YOU YOU CANNOT ONLY SOLVE THE EQUATION YOURSELF TO GIVE TO YOUR STUDENTS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE BASICALLY SOLVING THE SCHRODINGER OCCASION IT IS QUANTITATIVE AND RIGOROUS INDEFINITE IS DEFINITELY PHYSICIST COMFORT ZONE. THE DISCOMFORT COMES WHEN YOU REALIZE THIS OUR EXPERIMENTAL DATA. LET ME SHOW YOU DATA, THIS IS A LITTLE QUALITATIVE, URANIUM INSIDE A CLOUD CHAMBER. WHEN THE URANIUM EMITS A PARTICLE, THAT IS PARTICLE WILL MAKE IONS WHICH SHOW UP. SO WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS LITTLE STREAKS ON THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE, RADIOACTIVITY IS THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU ASK THE SCHRODINGER WHEN URANIUM EMITS A PARTICLE, AN ELECTRON MORE LESS SPHERICAL DISTRIBUTION. MORE OR LESS IN A BIG BLOB THEY GETS MORE OF THE URANIUM. THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE OR INDIVIDUAL TRACKS WAS A PARTICLE AGAIN. SO, IT SEEMS NAIVELY, IF YOU ARE REALLY AT IS, IT SEEMS LIKE ELECTRONS ACT LIKE WAVES ACT LIKE PARTICLES WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT CLEARLY, WE SHOULD BRING THE BRIGHTEST MINDS QUESTION AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING DANCER THEY CAME UP WITH THIS, ELECTRONS ACT THANK YOU THEY ACT LIKE PARTICLES WHEN YOU THIS IS CALLED THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION UNDERGRADUATES IN TEXTBOOKS. ELECTRON WAVE FUNCTION MAYBE SPREAD OUT IN AT IT IN AN ATOM FOR EXAMPLE BUT WHEN YOU AT IT, OBSERVE IT, THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSES. YOU DON'T SEE THAT BIG, SPREAD OUT PUFFY WAVE A PARTICLE. A WAVE FUNCTION LOCALIZED IN SOME PARTICULAR WHERE IT IS GOING TO APPEAR, YOU CAN'T SAY THIS IS WHERE THE PROBABILITY COMES INTO QUANTUM THE WAVE FUNCTION IS TELLING YOU BASICALLY OUTCOMES WHERE THE WAVE FUNCTION IS BIG , PROBABLE AND THE WAVE FUNCTION IS SMALL AND IMPROBABLE SO THIS IS CODIFIED IN TEXTBOOKS. I AM NOT MAKING THIS UP. THIS IS WHAT WE TEACH OUR STUDENTS. WHEN YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT A QUANTUM SYSTEM THERE ARE STATES OF THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM AND INSTEAD OF THE STATES BEING POSITIONS AND STATE OF THE EQUATION EQUATION BE NEWTON's EQUATION. THAT WOULD BE FINE BUT THERE IS THIS WHOLE SYSTEMS ARE MEASURED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM. THEN THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSES AND THERE THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED THE COPENHAGEN WORK TO DRIVE THE SUM LET'S TURN TO THE THOUGHT WHO DID A FAMOUS SCENARIO , ACTUALLY HE CAME . SCHRODINGER ACTUALLY DID THIS EXPERIMENT OF THE EXPERIMENT IS TO AMPLIFY THE QUANTUM SO THE IDEA IS IF YOU HAVE A QUANTUM MECHANICAL IS A DETECTOR LIKE A GEIGER COUNTER AND THE IS SOME PROBABILITY THAT THE GEIGER COUNTER BOX OF GAS WHICH IS RELEASED INTO THE BIGGER IT IS CLOSED . AND SCHRODINGER'S ORIGINAL IT WAS CYANIDE GAS AND WILL SCHRODINGER 'S LIKE CATS. [ LAUGHTER ] THE CAT 'S QUANTUM WAVE FUNCTION OR DEAD . THERE IS NO REASON TO KILL THE CAT WHAT IS GOING ON. YOU MY VERSION I PUT SLEEPING GAS INSIDE THE AWAKE AND ASLEEP ALL THE PHYSICS CONSEQUENCES SCHRODINGER'S CAP WAS NOT INVENTED BY SCHRODINGER AND WEIRD AND AMAZING USING QUANTUM MECHANICS YOU TO SAY , SURELY YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT BUT HE DID NOT INVENT THE INTERPRETATION OF IS TELLING US AS THE PROBABILITY OF GETTING CAT IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE BOX OPEN, YOU'RE A SUPERPOSITION. IT IS NOT TRUE IT IS EITHER ALIVE OR DEAD IT IS NEITHER AWAKE OR ASLEEP. IT IS IN SUPERPOSITION OF BOTH AT THE SAME AT THE TRADITIONAL INTERPRETATION. THE WHOLE POINT OF WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO MAKE THIS ORIGINAL INTERPRETATION. IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE A CLASSICAL POSSIBILITY. IT CAN ALWAYS BE TRUE BUT THERE IS SOMETHING WE CAN HAVE A BOX WITH THE CAT IN IT THAT NOT SURE . THAT IS CERTAINLY A PERFECTLY RESPECTABLE THAT IS BASED ON OUR SUBJECTIVE IGNORANCE THE QUANTUM MECHANICAL SITUATION IS DIFFERENT. THE PREDICTION OF SCHRODINGER's EQUATION IS IN THAT BOX THERE IS A SUPERPOSITION OF BOTH LET ME TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN THE POINT OF COPENHAGEN IS, WE TREAT SMALL AND BIG SYSTEMS BY THE RULES OF CLASSICAL THERE IS A DIVIDING LINE BETWEEN THE QUANTUM CUT. BECAUSE NOT ONLY NIELS BOHR, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS HEISENBERG HELP DEVELOP THESE IDEAS. THE HEISENBERG CUT SEPARATES THE QUANTUM WORLD LEVEL QUANTUM MECHANICAL CAT IN THIS CASE, AND A CLASSICAL OBSERVER, IN THIS CASE THE AND WHAT THE INTERPRETATION TELLS YOU IS WHEN A CAT THAT WAS AWAKE IN THE OBSERVER SAW IT SAW IT ASLEEP AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH. ALL YOU CAN DO IS PREDICT THE PROBABILITY. THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSED ONTO ONE POSSIBILITY SO THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS IT IS CLEARLY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WITH IT. OBVIOUSLY IT IS A STEP ALONG THE WAY I'M NOT WRONG, IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM DONE YET. THE TWO PROBLEMS I HAVE IN MIND WANTED WHICH THE ELECTRON SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF AS A WAVE IF YOU LOOK AT THE ELECTRON IT DOESN'T LOOK IS, WHAT IS THE WAVE FUNCTION OR FOR THAT IS THE WAVE FUNCTION ITSELF ON TO ONE ISOMORPHIC OR SOMEHOW JUST ENCODING OUR INABILITY TO GOING TO BE. ARE THE OTHER VARIABLES OVER AND ABOVE THE PEOPLE LIKE EINSTEIN AND OTHERS THOUGHT THEY PREDICTIONS IF ONLY WE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE. OR DOES THE WAVE FUNCTION HAVE NOTHING TO IS IT JUST A TOOL FOR MAKING PREDICTIONS? OF THESE IS ANSWERED BY THE TRADITIONAL INTERPRETATION. AND EVEN MORE FAMOUSLY WE HAVE THE MEASUREMENT OF COURSE TO MAKE IT VIVID I SAID ELECTRONS BE THINKING WHAT DO YOU MEAN LOOK AT THEM? DOES IT HAVE TO BE A PERSON LOOKING? DOES THE PERSON HAVE TO BE AWAY? COULD IT BE THE CAT LOOKING AT ITSELF? WHAT ABOUT A VIDEO CAMERA? WHAT ABOUT A ROCK? WHAT IF I GLANCED AT IT? DOES THAT COUNT? DOES THE WAVE FUNCTION COLLAPSE IF I GLANCED DOES HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS SOMEHOW GET INVOLVED AGENCY THE ABILITY TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS AND SOMEHOW WE DON'T AGREE THIS IS WHY THERE IS PHYSICIST DON'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS OPINIONS ON THESE QUESTIONS WE DO NOT HAVE THEM. SO, MY MAIN MESSAGE, IF I HAVE ONE, THESE THESE ARE NOT IMPOSSIBLE, NOT JUST PHILOSOPHY, TIRED TO DO REAL WORK ANYMORE, THIS SHOULD I SECONDARY MESSAGES, I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT WAS INVENTED BY THIS GUY, HUGH EVERETT, JOHN WHEELER. BASICALLY, EVERY'S SUGGESTION IS WE SHOULD [ LAUGHTER ] HE SAID , HE SUGGESTED THE SIMPLEST MECHANICS. HE SAID, YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS REAL? IT IS THE WAVE FUNCTION. OBVIOUSLY THE WAVE FUNCTION WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW WAVE FUNCTION DEVOLVE? THEY OBEY THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. YOU KNOW THAT IS WHAT THEY DO, THEY DON'T IT IS KIND OF A QUANTUM THERAPY HE IS OFFERING IN OTHER WORDS, HERE IS THE EVERETT INTERPRETATION THERE IS ONLY ONE SET OF RULES. THEY ALWAYS APPLY ALL THE TIME . SYSTEMS ARE WILL BE THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. THE PROBLEM IS, ALREADY TOLD YOU WHAT THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT QUANTUM MECHANICAL SYSTEM SUBSTANCES, THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE WAVE FUNCTION. THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE THEY ARE OBEYING THE EVERETT SAYS THAT IS BECAUSE YOU NEED TO IN SOMETHING. AND WHEN YOU ARE DOING THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE TAKING QUANTUM MECHANICS SERIOUSLY TO EVERETT NUMBER1, YOU CAN'T PRETEND YOU ARE CLASSICAL. YOU CAN'T PRETEND EVEN THOUGH YOUR OBSERVER MECHANICS. YOU ARE JUST AS QUANTUM AS EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU ARE MADE OF ATOMS SO YOU SHOULD OBEY THE YOU SHOULD HAVE A WAVE ACTION. OF ELECTRONS CAN BE IN SUPERPOSITION THE POSSIBILITY THAT IS ONE FACT. THE IDEA THAT EINSTEIN AND OTHERS DEVELOPED REALLY , REALLY WHAT MAKES QUANTUM MECHANICS OF ENTANGLEMENT I WILL INTRODUCE IT BY A MODERN BUT THERE WERE EXAMPLES WAY BACK IN THE DAY. WE RECENTLY, IN 2012 DISCOVERED A NEW, FUNDAMENTAL IN THIS TATTERED PARTICLE PHYSICS WE DISCOVERED THE KNOWN ELEMENTARY PARTICLES AND HAS 0 SPIN SPINS AROUND ITS AXIS BUT AT THE PARTICLE AMOUNTS OF SPIN BETTER VERY DEFINITE NUMBERS. SOMETHING LIKE AN ELECTRON OR QUARK CAN EITHER A SPIN UP OR BEEN DOWN BUT IT HAS EXACTLY THE IMPORTANT THING IS IT IS CONSERVED NOT SO WHEN IT DECAYS INTO TWO PARTICLES LET'S OR QUARK AND ANTIQUARK, A SPIN WAS PARTICLE TOTAL SPIN HAS TO BE CONSERVED SO WHAT YOU INTO BETTER BE SPINNING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS UP AND THIS ARE OPPOSITES OF THE TOTAL SPIN ADDS TO 0 ON THE MECHANICS IS YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE IT COULD BE SPIN UP OR SPIN DOWN BUT THERE ONE IN THE SPIN OF THE OTHER. THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE HIGGS IS INTO THE SPIN UP AND PARTICLE 2 SPIN DOWN PARTICLE WERE TO OBSERVE THE SPIN OF PARTICLE ON YOU UP OR DOWN. IF YOU OBSERVE THE SPIN OF PARTICLE 2 YOU BE DOWN OR UP BUT IF YOU OBSERVE THE SPIN ON PARTICLE OF PARTICLE ONE HAS SPIN UP THEN HAS TO BE THE OPPOSITE TO BALANCE OUT. THAT IS QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT. YOU DON'T KNOW, THERE IS NO DEFINITE FACT BUT THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM. THIS IS A FEATURE OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS WHICH REALLY MAKES IT DIFFERENT THAN CLASSICAL CLASSICAL MECHANICS YOU GIVE TWO PARTICLES. PARTICLE ONE IS DOING SOMETHING, PARTICLE THERE IS A STATE OF PARTICLE ON , POSITION, PARTICLE 2 POSITION, VELOCITY AND SPIN. YOU MIGHT THINK IN QUANTUM MECHANICS EVERY WE TALK THAT WAY. PARTICLE ONE COULD HAVE A WAVE FUNCTION THAT LIKEWISE PARTICLE 2 BUT NO THAT IS NOT HOW THERE IS ONLY ONE WAVE FUNCTION FOR ALL THE THERE IS ONLY THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSE. AND IN THIS CASE THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE THIS IS PROBABLY, FOR THE FIRST TWO THIRDS GOING TO LAY ON YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND THIS. ENTANGLEMENT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT PARTICLE 1 THEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOU GET IF YOU WERE TO SO LET'S APPLY THIS IDEA OF ENTANGLEMENT AND TO THE SCHRODINGER'S CAT EXPERIMENT. THAT IS WHAT HUGH EVERETT SUGGESTS THAT WE OBSERVATION OR MEASUREMENT OR CONSCIOUSNESS. YOU ARE JUST A PHYSICAL SYSTEM OBEYING THE YOU HAVE THE CAT , IT IS IN A SUPERPOSITION NOW PLAYED IN THE ROLE BY HUGH EVERETT, AND BOX AND YOU SOLVE THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. IN THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION DESCRIBES THE SO AGAIN ABSOLUTELY NO AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHAT BEFORE THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION, WE MADE AND OBSERVE IT COLLAPSES AND YOU SEE ON OUTCOME SCHRODINGER EQUATION SAYS. AND THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU AND THE CAT EVOLVED AWAKE AND YOU SAW IT AWAY, PLUS THE CAP WAS AGAIN, NO ON DOUBTS THAT IS WHAT THE SCHRODINGER THE PUZZLE IS, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE NOW IN AND HAVING SEEN THE CAP ASLEEP NO ONE EVER NO ONE EVER OPENS THE BOX , WELL PART OF ME THE CAT IS ASLEEP. THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU THINK. IT IS NOT CRAZY TO THINK THAT EVERETT WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG. IN FACT, IN SOME SENSE HE WAS AHEAD OF HIS WASN'T UNDERSTOOD UNTIL THE 70s OR 80s WITH I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE AT ONCE . AND I SHOWED YOU A PICTURE ON THE AND THE OBSERVER. WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE? IT REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE THE REST OF THE ENTIRE SO WE BUNDLE UP THE ENTIRE REST OF THE UNIVERSE. WE DON'T KEEP TRACK OF EVERYTHING, WE CALL OF GRASS. BUT THE ENVIRONMENT COULD BE THE PHOTONS OR ALL OF THE THINGS, ALL THE PARTICLES, DEGREES IN OUR EXPERIMENT. BUT YOU CAN TELL OF THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE INTERACT WITH THE CAT LONG BEFORE WE OPEN SO THAT PROCESS IS CALLED DECOHERENCE, BECAUSE IF THE CAT IS AWAKE AND OVERHEAR A CERTAIN IF THE CAP IS ASLEEP PHOTON GOES RIGHT ON THE WAY THE ENVIRONMENT INTERACTS WITH THE SO THE CAT VERY, VERY QUICKLY BECOMES ENTANGLED AND THE PROCESS IS CALLED DECOHERENCE. THE OBSERVER JUST GOES ALONG FOR THE RIDE BECOME ENTANGLED WITH BOTH THE CAT AND THE THIS STORY I JUST TOLD YOU IS A SLIGHTLY MORE THE LAST SLIDE. SO WHY AM I BOTHERING TO TELL YOU THIS SLIGHTLY BECAUSE YOU CAN SHOW, USING MATH AND STUFF ENTANGLED WITH THE CAT IS PERPENDICULAR TO CAT. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN IS NEVER AFFECTED IN ANY WAY BY WHAT IS GOING THEY HAVE BECOME UNCOMMUNICATIVE. THEY DO NOT TALK TO EACH OTHER, THEY DO NOT THAT IS WHAT DECOHERENCE REALLY IS ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT MEASUREMENT IS ACCORDING TO THE MEASUREMENT IS SIMPLY ON A SMALL QUANTUM SYSTEM AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE WAVE FUNCTION IS A THE SUPER POSITION GO THEIR OWN WAY. HAPPENS IN ONE IS INDEPENDENT OF WHAT HAPPENS THEY BRANCH AS EVERETT PUT IT. THEY SPLIT INTO TWO POSSIBILITIES. IT IS AS IF THOSE TWO PARTS OF WAVE FUNCTION AND THAT IS WHY THE EVERETT INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS, BECAUSE THESE TWO PARTS TALK TO EACH OTHER ANYMORE. WE SHOULD TREAT THEM AS IF THEY HAVE NOTHING AS IF THEY ARE INDEPENDENT. WHAT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE IS, I DID NOT PUT ALL I DID WAS TAKE THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION SCHRODINGER EQUATION PREDICTS THE EXISTENCE EVERY OTHER VERSION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IS AND MAYBE THAT IS WORTH DOING . BUT EVERETT THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION IS WHAT WAS ONE COPY BUT THEY ARE SEPARATE PEOPLE. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WAY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER JUST TAKE THEM AT FACE VALUE, THERE IS TO IT, CHILL OUT DON'T MESS WITH THE RULES OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] IT DID NOT GO OVER WELL. FAVORITE'S THESIS ADVISOR, JOHN WHEELER, WAS AND MANY HARSH LETTERS WERE SENT BACK AND EVERETT NEVER TRIED TO GET AN ACT BIG ACADEMIC INTERPRETATION WAS MORE OR LESS FORGOTTEN SO, THERE ARE GOOD REASONS TO BE SKEPTICAL, THE EVERETT INTERPRETATION BUT ALSO A BUNCH I DON'T MIND IF YOU COME AWAY FROM THE LECTURE INTERPRETATION BUT I WANT TO NOT LEAVE IT LET ME TRY TO ASK AND ANSWER SOME OF THE SIMPLEST THE SIMPLEST QUESTION TO WHICH I ONLY HAVE ARE THERE ANYWAY? I JUST SHOWED YOU A PICTURE WHEREWITH THE WITH AN ELECTRON, IF YOU MEASURE THE LOCATION ANSWERS COULD YOU GET? THE ANSWER IS INFINITY ANSWERS. THERE IS AN INFINITE NUMBER OF POINTS IN SPACE NAIVELY, MAYBE IN REALITY, THERE ARE INFINITELY THE REALITY IS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY-WORLDS OF QUANTUM MECHANICS. THERE COULD BE INFINITELY MANY IN WHICH CASE YOU SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE RELATIVE WEIGHT ANOTHER WAY. WHAT I WANT TO GET ACROSS IS, PEOPLE WORRY MEASURE A SPIN AND SUDDENLY THERE IS T UNIVERSES GALAXIES IN THAT UNIVERSE? WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IS AS TIME GOES UP, THERE IS A LOT OF WEIGHT A LOT OF WAVE FUNCTION THROUGH A SERIES OF PHYSICAL INTERACTIONS UNIVERSE IS DIVIDED UP INTO MULTIPLE COPIES. IT IS NOT THAT YOU ARE CREATING NEW STUFF, SENSE, DINNER THAN THEY USED TO BE BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT CREATING MORE STUFF YOU ARE JUST THERE INTO MANY, MANY COPIES. THE PEOPLE IN THE COPIES DON'T KNOW THIS, DON'T WORRY ABOUT CONSERVATION OF ENERGY OR ANOTHER QUESTION IS, I JUST DON'T LIKE IT I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO BUT I AM TRYING TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THE LIKE THE MANY-WORLDS INTERPRETATION BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO ANSWER A SIMPLE QUESTION INFINITE NUMBER OF UNIVERSES. DOESN'T THAT SEEM LIKE BRINGING AN AWFUL LOT I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY BACKWARDS. I THINK EVERETT REALLY IS THE SIMPLEST , MOST REMEMBER, ALL THE MANY-WORLDS INTERPRETATION FUNCTION's AND THEY OBEY THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. THE WORLD's ARE A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT. YOU DID NOT PUT THEM IN. IF YOU BELIEVE AN ELECTRON CAN BE IN A SUPERPOSITION , YOU BELIEVE THE WORLD OBEYS THE RULES OF SUPERPOSITION OF HAVING SEEN THE ELECTRON IN THE UNIVERSE CAN BE IN A SUPERPOSITION. YOU CAN'T STOP LIKING IT WHEN THE SUPERPOSITION's OF QUANTUM MECHANICS IN SOME WAY. AND YOU THEORY MORE COMPLICATED. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT SIMPLER. EVERETT IS SIMPLY THE SIMPLEST WAY TO GO. THE OTHER EASILY OF TENSION IS THIS CAN BE YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID I CANNOT INFLUENCE THEM WAY. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SCIENCE TO ME IF I BUT THAT IS NOT RIGHT. EVERY THEORY MAKES PREDICTIONS THAT CAN'T WE DON'T COUNT IT AGAINST THE THEORY WHEN WE ASK, WHAT ARE THE PREDICTIONS THAT CAN THE TYPICAL CRITERIA WOULD LIKE TO USE, NOT AND WE IMAGINE AN EXPERIMENT THAT WOULD TELL IT WOULD TELL US THE THEORY IS NOT CORRECT. IT IS FALSIFIED. AND THE CASE OF EVERETT IN QUANTUM MECHANICS CAN YOU IMAGINE EXPERIENCE THAT FALSIFY THOSE YES. THEY ARE BEING DONE AND IT IS GOING ON RIGHT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS OBSERVE AN ISOLATED EQUATION. THERE ARE THEORIES IN WHICH THAT HAPPENS AND NOW. EVERETT IS THE MOST FALSIFIABLE THEORY EVER ALL RIGHT. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY, I MENTIONED I DON'T WANT TO DENIGRATE PHILOSOPHY. I AM A BIG FAN OF PHILOSOPHY. I THINK POSSIBLY IS IMPORTANT. EMPIRICALLY PHILOSOPHERS OF PHYSICS HAVE DONE SERIOUSLY THAN PHYSICISTS HAVE. I DO THINK THAT MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED WITHIN PHYSICS IF WE HAVE ABANDONED THE QUEST SAKE. IF YOU CLAIM , IF SOMEONE CAN GET UP IN FRONT QUANTUM MECHANICS AND SOMEONE ELSE COMES UP OF GRAVITY FOR EXAMPLE, WILL WHY SHOULD WE THIS IS NOT USUALLY THE WAY PEOPLE THINK BECAUSE AND QUANTIZE IT SO THE SEARCH FOR SOMETHING CLASSICAL THEORY OF GRAVITY TURNING INTO A PRESUMABLY NATURE DOESN'T DO THAT . MAJOR QUANTIZE IT NATURE IS JUST QUANTUM FROM THE MAYBE THE REASON WE DON'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MECHANICS. I SUGGEST THIS NOT ONLY IS A LOGICAL POSSIBILITY JUST TO REMIND YOU OF HOW GRAVITY WORKS, THOSE RELATIVITY, OUR BEST CURRENT THEORY OF GRAVITY GRAVITY IS THE CURVATURE OF SPACETIME . YOU SPACE-TIME, THE THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE ALL EINSTEIN SAYS YOU SHOULD THINK OF SPACETIME ON WHICH PHYSICS HAPPENS, THE PLAYER IN THE SPACE-TIME IS DYNAMICAL. IT WORKS, IT ENDS, AND CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO MATTER, TO MOMENTUM, TO ENERGY IS THE SIMPLEST WHEN AN APPLE FALLS FROM THE TREE BECAUSE AND TIME AROUND IT SO FALLING IS THE SIMPLEST IF YOU WANT A MOTTO FOR GENERAL RELATIVITY, TO ENERGY. THIS IS THE THING WE WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT AS I ALREADY SAID, WE DON'T UNDERSTAND QUANTUM MAYBE THESE LACKS OF UNDERSTANDING ARE SOMEHOW THE PROGRAM IS RATHER THIN QUANTIZE IN GRAVITY, MECHANICS. WE SHOULD START WITH THE PURELY QUANTUM IDEA EVERETT QUANTUM MECHANICS THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES THEIR VERSIONS WERE THERE ARE HIDDEN VARIABLES, ALL OF THESE , SOME LINGERING ELEMENT OF CLASSICAL THERE IS SOME CLASSICAL PRESUPPOSITIONS THAT WORLDS . EVERETT IS THE MOST PURELY QUANTUM THERE ARE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME WITH THE PURELY THE CLASSICAL DESCRIPTION ARISES, PUTTING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO . NOT TO TRAUMA WE ARE ALLOWED TO TAKE HINTS FROM THE REAL THE BEST THEORY WE HAVE OF THE REAL WORLD CALLED QUANTUM FIELD THEORY. I TALKED ABOUT PARTICLES LIKE ELECTRONS AND IN MODERN PHYSICS THE FUNDAMENTAL INGREDIENTS FIELDS. A VERY SUBTLE THING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE THEY ARE WAVES. BUT NOW I'M TELLING YOU THAT THE THINK THAT YOU GO FROM PARTICLE TO WAVE FUNCTION YOU OF THE FIELD. THIS IS VERY COMPLICATED. I WROTE MANY WORDS ABOUT THEM I PUT THEM IN BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING IT'S THE FINAL ANSWER AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE LECTURE YOU HAVE TO THE POINT OF FIELDS VERSUS PARTICLES IS, A IT IS THERE, IT IS NOT ANYWHERE ELSE. A FIELD IS THE OPPOSITE. THE FIELD IS EVERYWHERE. THE MAGNETIC FIELD YOU MIGHT SEE BECAUSE YOU IS A VALUE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE UNIVERSITY YOU MIGHT BE ZERO IN SOME PLACES, LARGE OTHER QUANTUM FIELD THEORY THE BASIS OF THE STANDARD OF THOSE FIELDS ARE WHAT YOU AND I PERCEIVE WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT EVEN EMPTY SPACE HAS REALLY IMPORTANT FEATURE OF QUANTUM FIELD TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU JUMP RIGHT TO THE AND QUANTUM FIELD THEORY THERE ARE THESE WAVES THEY ARE ALL QUANTIZED AND LOW ENERGY STATE PARTICLE WHEN YOU TAKE THAT QUANTUM FIELD MORE STRONGLY THAN IT WOULD IN ITS LOWEST OF THE WORD REALLY MADE OF PARTICLES WE WOULD EMPTY SPACE ELSEWHERE. AT THE WORLD WAS MADE OF QUANTUM YIELDS WE THE THERE ARE STILL MODES, VIBRATIONS OF THE YOU WILL NOT BE SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THESE WITH EACH OTHER. ALL THE FIELDS OF VIBRATING AND IF THEY ARE TO DO WITH EACH OTHER, NO RELATIONSHIP THERE SO THE LOWEST ENERGY THING TO DO THE EMPTY NEARBY PATCHES OF SPACE ARE HIGHLY ENTANGLED. AND REGIONS OF SPACE THAT ARE VERY FAR AWAY SO IT IS VERY NATURAL THAT IN QUANTUM FIELD BETWEEN THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE , BECAUSE THAT DISTANCES AND TRIANGLES AND LENGTHS AND STUFF BETWEEN THOSE DIFFERENT REGIONS OF SPACE. THE SHORTER THE DISTANCE THE MORE THE ENTANGLEMENT. SO LET'S TURN THIS AROUND. THAT WAS TAKING A CLUE FROM WHAT WE ALREADY OUR PROJECT IS NOT TO TAKE SOME FIELDS AND QUANTUM AND FIND THE STUFF WE KNOW IN IT. SO INSTEAD OF SAYING WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSE MAYBE WHAT WE CAN SAY IS, WHEN THINGS ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. I AM USING THE WORD THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS INGREDIENTS OF THESE KINDS OF DESCRIPTIONS FREEDOM ARE NOT VERY ENTANGLED THAN THEY ARE IN OTHER WORDS, IF YOU GIVE ME A BUNCH OF THAT KNITS THEM TOGETHER AND IF WE ARE LUCKY , THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACE WITH A CERTAIN GEOMETRY THERE IS A VERY NATURAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THERE IS ALSO A VERY NATURAL RELATIONSHIP REMEMBER, WE SAID THAT IN EMPTY SPACE THE IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY. WE ALSO SAID THAT PARTICLES WHICH CARRY ENERGY, THE QUANTUM FIELDS IN ONE REGION OF SPACE. THE EXTRA THING YOU DO GENERICALLY BREAKS VIBRATION YOU PERCEIVE AS A PARTICLE IN THE WHEN YOU PUT PARTICLES AND THEREFORE ENERGY WITH ALL THE STUFF AROUND IT. SO THERE IS ANOTHER DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENTANGLEMENT. WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THIS BUNCH OF HANDWAVING? AGAIN THERE ARE SOME EQUATIONS ATTACHED TO THIS IS SPECULATIVE STUFF. LETTING YOU IN ON THE CUTTING EDGE BY STUFF BUT WE HAVE IS VERY NATURAL FOR ENTANGLEMENT BUT WE KNOW FROM QUANTUM FIELD THEORY IS THE ENTANGLED WHEN THEY ARE NEARBY. WE CAN IN PRINCIPLE EXTRACT THE GEOMETRY OF EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD. THERE IS ALSO A VERY NATURAL RELATIONSHIP WHEN YOU CHANGE THE ENTANGLEMENT , YOU BREAK AND OTHER ONCE IT IS LIKE PUTTING ENERGY IN THUS, THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GEOMETRY NOT STARTING FROM A DESCRIPTION OF SPACE, WITH THE QUANTUM FUNCTION WITH DIFFERENT BITS IF YOU START WITH THAT QUANTUM DESCRIPTION NATURALLY CORRESPOND TO, THE ANSWER IS A SPACE TO THE ENERGY INSIDE. GUESS WHAT? THAT IS GENERAL RELATIVELY. THAT IS THE RULES OF SPACE AND TIME AND GRAVITY WHAT EINSTEIN HAD TO DO WAS CAUSE IT, AN EQUATION OF CURVATURE. WHAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO UNDER A LONG LAUNDRY TO PUT IT POLITELY, AND YET YOU PROVEN TO ASSUMPTIONS WE CAN DERIVE EINSTEIN'S EQUATION FREEDOM. AGAIN THIS IS VERY PRELIMINARY AND WORK BEING ENTANGLEMENT AND SPACETIME IN GEOMETRY AND WE CAN AT LEAST SEE THE VAGUE OUTLINE OF A SOME CLASSICAL THEORY CALLING THAT QUANTUM THERE IS WAVE FUNCTION's ENTANGLED ETC. AND WAVE FUNCTION? HOW WOULD WE INTERPRET IT? WHAT IS THE CLASSICAL LIMIT? WHAT ARE THE EMERGENT REALITIES THAT COME IS VERY NATURAL IT SEEMS FOR THAT EMERGING EQUATION OF GENERAL RELATIVITY. LET ME CLOSE WITH A QUOTE FROM DAVID DEUTSCH, AND THE MANY RULES OF INTERPRETATION IN PARTICULAR. DESPITE THE UNRIVALED EMPIRICAL SUCCESS OF INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM THEORY, THE VERY A DESCRIPTION OF NATURE IS WITH CYNICISM AND I'M HOPING THAT THE END OF TODAY'S TALK AT LESS THAN IT WAS AT THE BEGINNING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. [ APPLAUSE ] I THINK THERE IS TIME FOR QUESTIONS. I BELIEVE I AM IN CHARGE. WHAT HE WILL DO IS RUN PELL- MELL UP TO THESE I WILL PICK ON YOU. I DON'T KNOW ARE THERE ANY MICROPHONES OF NO? SORRY. YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME DOWN. YOUR FIRST. THANKS FOR THE GREAT TALK. THANKS. THE COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS OBSERVER ISSUE WHAT COUNTS AS AN OBSERVED ISN'T THAT STILL AN ISSUE IN THE EVERETTIAN WHAT CONSTITUTES AN EVENT IN WHICH BRANCHING GOOD. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW THE [ LAUGHTER ] . WAY. OCCURS WHEN INTEGUMENT BECOMES ENTANGLED WITH TO UNDERSTAND WHEN THE MEASUREMENT HAPPENS EQUATION. TO BE MORE FAIR, THERE IS A QUESTION OF EMERGENCE. THERE IS A QUESTION OF MICROSCOPIC AND MACROSCOPIC IF YOU THOUGHT YOU KNEW THE WAVE FUNCTION AND KNEW THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT SUBSYSTEMS YOU HAVE RICH? THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE THE REALITY WE PERCEIVE HIGHER-LEVEL, INCOMPLETE THING WHICH IS NOT THE SINGLE HARDEST THING TO DO IN THE EVERETT DOWN WITH THE FORMALISM IS , IT IS TO CONNECT OF COURSE WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT CONSTITUTES THE ELECTRON IN A CLOUD CHAMBER, WHATEVER. THERE IS SOME WORK TO BE DONE AND ATTACHED IN PARTICULAR SHOWING THE WORLD's REALLY DO SHOWING WHY THERE IS A PROBABILITY RULE IN THAT IS THE ONGOING RESEARCH OF THE EVERETT STUFF. THANKS. SHIRT. YES? SO, WHEN YOU ARE SAYING LIKE WHEN YOU OBSERVE PART OF THE QUANTUM FIELD AND THAT LIKE JUST THAT ENTANGLEMENT DOESN'T EXIST IT IS JUST IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'M SAYING THERE. WHAT I'M SAYING IS , LET ME SAY SOMETHING YOU HOPE I AM SAYING. WHEN THERE IS A PARTICLE WHICH IS SWEEPING IN A QUANTUM FIELD BUT THAT IS KIND HAVE NOT HAVE BEEN A PARTICLE OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE THING WE ARE OBSERVING HAS A WAVE FUNCTION. WHEN WE MAKE THAT OBSERVATION OF ITS POSITION, CERTAINTY WHAT ANSWER WE WILL GET AHEAD OF THAT IS THE EMPIRICAL FACT. THE EVERETTIAN EXPLANATION FOR THE EMPIRICAL YOU ARE OBSERVING AND ALL THE POSSIBLE MEASUREMENT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ENTANGLED POSITION YOU THINK YOU JUST MEASURED . OKAY. THANK YOU. CLOSE ENOUGH? [ LAUGHTER ] BETTER THAN I USUALLY GET [ LAUGHTER SO, I WAS READING YOUR BOOK, AND I WAS TRYING . IN THAT NORMAL DELAYED CHOICE APPEARS WHEN NOT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE COHERENCE FOR IT IS VERY CONFUSING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEFORE ANY OF THE -- WHICH PATH IS GOING TO YOU HAVE A PATTERN YOU CANNOT SEE AND YOU WHICH ONE BUT THE PATTERN IS THERE AN BRANCHING IF YOU STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES ARE GOING GOOD. I AM NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GIVE A COMPLETE THIS IS A LONGER STORY. THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT HANGING OUT ON THE THE DELAYED CHOICE QUANTUM ERASER EXPERIMENT A WAY THAT LOOKS LIKE A PARTICLE SEEMINGLY EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY PREVIOUSLY IT ACTS WAVELIKE OR PARTICLE LIKE DEPENDING WHICH SEEMS WEIRD AND ALMOST AS IF SIGNALS I THINK THE IDEA, I THINK THAT THE STANDARD ARE ALL NEEDLESSLY , INTENTIONALLY MAKING SENSE IN ORDINARY QUANTUM MECHANICS WITHOUT BASIC TRICK IS TO FUSS AROUND WITH WHAT DO QUANTUM MECHANICS WHAT WE MEAN BY MAKING A IN EVERETT IS 100% CLEAR YOU ARE SOLVING THE MEASUREMENT OCCURS WHEN THE QUANTUM SYSTEM IF RATHER THAN INTENTIONALLY WITH A BILLION THEN YOU CAN KEEP THAT ELECTRON, SHIELDED IT. YOU COULD APPARENTLY DO THE OBSERVATION BUT BY. BUT ALL I WILL SAY ABOUT IT , IT IS 100% COMPLETELY THE STRONGER EQUATION FORWARD IN TIME . WE I DIDN'T -- THERE IS A BLOG POST ABOUT THIS ANOTHER SECTION MY EDITOR FORCED ME TOO CUT I WAS WONDERING IS THE SPLIT LIKE FROM ONE YES. IT IS NOT INSTANTANEOUS IT TAKES ABOUT THAT IT IS VERY, VERY FAST. LITERALLY SOMETHING CALLED THE DECOHERENCE IF A PHOTON HITS YOUR EYEBALL YOU CAN ASK BECAUSE THE EYEBALL IS A WARM WET THING THAT LESS THAN TEN THE MINUS 22nd. IT'S NOT INSTANTANEOUS REALLY FAST. HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT GENERAL RELATIVITY. IN SPACE HAS A CERTAIN RATE AT WHICH IT MOVES TO THAT CLOCK IN SPACE . SO ON EARTH WOULD IF --YOU COMMERCIALLY BECAUSE IT'S CLOSER IF IT GOES INTO A HOLE IN THE EARTH, IT IS BUT, IT IS UNDER LESS GRAVITY BECAUSE IT IS FASTER THAN THE ONE ON THE SURFACE? -SLOWER. THANK YOU. [ LAUGHTER ] HI. THANKS WITH A GREAT TALK. ABOUT IT WAS QUITE ILLUMINATING. MY QUESTION IS A BIT RELATED TO CAUSALITY. I THINK A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TOUCHED IT BEFORE WHEN YOU HAVE THIS BRANCHING, THE CAUSALITY TO OPEN THE BOX AND IN THE CASE OF SCHRODINGER'S OR NOT. SO HOW DO YOU KIND OF INCORPORATE CAUSALITY AND THE SECOND THING IS, I KNOW YOU HAD DAVID PERSPECTIVE HOW INNER TAKES THE PROBLEM I THINK WE GET ONE QUESTION. SORRY. THE QUESTIONS CONNECTED SO BECAUSE CAUSALITY TO BEGIN WITH BECAUSE WHO DECIDES AT THE BEGINNING OUT OR WHAT ARE THE BRANCHES? IN MY VIEW OF IT, CONSCIOUSNESS IS ENTIRELY ARE IN THE UNIVERSE. THE ONLY THING THAT EVER HAPPENS IN THIS VIEW OBEYING THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. GUESS WHAT? THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION IS COMPLETELY DETERMINED THERE IS A QUESTION, A GOOD PHILOSOPHY QUESTION REALITY, BUT THE WAVE FUNCTION ITSELF IS COMPLETELY AT THE LEVEL OF WAVE FUNCTION AN BRANCHING, YOU ARE JUST OBEYING THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. AND THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CAUSALITY. YOU'RE JUST OBEYING THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. ALL OF THOSE ARE WORDS THAT ARE USEFUL AT LIKE YOU IN NEED BUT THEY ARE NOT THERE IN OKAY. REGARDING THE BRANCHING YOU SAID TWO BRANCHES DOES THAT MEAN THEY CAN'T INTERFERE? YES THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT MEANS. THEY CAN'T INTERFERE AT ALL? THAT IS CLEVER. SORRY. [ LAUGHTER ] OTHERWISE A LOT MORE SCIENCE YES. SO, QUANTUM MECHANICS TO ME REMINDS ME A BIT DEALING PROBABILITIES. FROM STATISTICAL MECHANICS STANDPOINT, IF OF SOME SPACE, FOR EXAMPLE THIS ROOM, THE ON WHERE THAT PARTICULAR MOLECULE OF OXYGEN MY QUESTION IS, IF THAT IS INDEED THE CASE, OF ALL OF THOSE WORLDS, IF THE BULK PROPERTIES ARE EXACTLY THE SAME? YES. I AM NOT SURE I EXACTLY GET THE THRUST OF THE WORLD's ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONAL's IN THEM. THE CAT IS AWAKING ON GOLD AND ASLEEP IN THE BUT THERE'S A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN QUANTUM THE WAVE ACTION IS ONTOLOGICAL. IT REPRESENTS WHAT REALITY IS DOING. DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION IN CLASSICAL MECHANICS SO YES THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON WITH BOTH BUT THE WEIGHT FUNCTION IS REALLY REALITY THANK YOU. SURE. SO MY QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE MANY-WORLDS THEORY. YOU MENTIONED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE DUPLICATING WHEN YOU HAVE , BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE SPLIT WITH INFINITE ENERGY, RIGHT? COULD YOU NOT WORK BACKWARDS WITH THAT ARGUMENT HAVE TO HAVE AN INFINITE INITIAL UNIVERSE POINT THE SPLITTING HAS BECOME SO INTENSE OR IS THERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE AVAILABILITY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. 's ARTICLE IS DISTRACTED I'M GOING TO CALL EIGHT PEOPLE GET QUESTIONS OTHERWISE I WILL YES. SO, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THERE IS, IF AS I BELIEVE, IF THERE IS A LIMIT ONLY A FINITE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE BRANCHES, IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE. THE POINT IS BASICALLY THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM IT WILL LOOK LIKE EMPTY SPACE AND THERE WILL DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE WAVE FUNCTION. WE ARE NOWHERE CLOSE TO THAT RIGHT NOW. THAT IS A QUESTION FOR OUR ANCESTORS . DESCENDANTS. PHYSICISTS . [ LAUGHTER ] THANK YOU. MY QUESTION IS ABOUT --SHE SAID ENTANGLEMENT THE SPACE . BUT, SPACETIME BOUNDARY LOCALLY THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE AND INFINITE RELATED TO THE ENERGY AND GEOMETRY WE HAVE THE BOUNDARY OF THE BLACK HOLE ? RIGHT I WILL ONLY DO A PARTIAL ANSWER THAT BEEN CHEATING ON ME LISTENING TO OTHER PEOPLE THERE IS A THING FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T ADS EFTU RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A COSMOLOGICAL ADS AND A PARTICULAR KIND OF QUANTUM FIELD FIELD THEORY OR CFT AND THEY ARE THE SAME SIZES. THE THEORY OF QUANTUM GRAVITY THAT IS THE NATURALLY, THIS IS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY BY THINGS ABOUT GRAVITY FROM UNDERSTANDING FIELD IN PARTICULAR, WHAT YOU CAN SHOW , FIRST MENTIONED SPACETIME ON THE GRAVITY SIDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP FIELD THEORY SIDE OF THE RELATIONSHIP. THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND THAT RELATIONSHIP IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ALSO A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GEOMETRY AND ENTANGLEMENT. ADS CFT IS WHERE THEY ARE MAXIMALLY FAR AWAY THERE IS A COSMOLOGY THAT IS DEFINITELY BIG BACK THAT THINGS GOING ON , ON THE BOUNDARY, ADVANTAGE OF GRAVITY REALLY BEING DIFFERENT BIG. LIKE A BLACK HOLE WHERE ADS WOULD BE LIKE HERE, I'M WORKING IN THE WEEK FILLED LIMIT MY GOAL, THIS ENTANGLEMENT IS NOT IN A FARAWAY IN THIS ROOM. AS MY GOAL IS TO UNDERSTAND WHY APPLES FALL IN A FIVE DIMENSIONAL SPACE-TIME. THANK YOU. SURE. I FEEL LIKE THIS IS PROBABLY NOT A VERY GOOD ARE ENTANGLED? WHAT IS IT MEAN WHEN THINGS ARE ENTANGLED? GOOD. IS THAT IT? YES. THE BURDEN YOU ARE STRUGGLING UNDER HIS HAVING YOU THINK THAT IF I HAVE A PARTICLE , NOT HAVE A PARTICLE IT HAS A LOCATION IN SPACE. THAT IS A VERY NATURAL, INNOCENT SOUNDING YOU HAVE THIS WAVE FUNCTION, THERE IS THIS THE WAVE FUNCTION TELLS ME WHERE THE PARTICLE WHAT EVERETT IS TRYING TO TELL US IS, THAT THE WAVE FUNCTION DOESN'T TELL YOU THE PROBABILITY THE WAVE FUNCTION IS ALL THAT EXISTS. BEFORE YOU LOOKED AT IT, THERE IS NO SUCH THERE IS ONLY THE WAVE FUNCTION. WHAT POSITIONS ARE IN EVERETTI QUANTUM MECHANICS GREETINGS OF WHICH THINGS ARE MADE IF YOU ARE THE POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONAL OUTCOMES . IF PARTICLES. OR NEARLY WITH INK WHERE ARE THE PARTICLES POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONAL OUTCOMES. ENTANGLEMENT IS SIMPLY WHEN THE POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONAL NONTRIVIAL WAY TO THE POSSIBLE OBSERVATIONAL YOU CAN SAY I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS PARTICLE THEN I CAN SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER PARTICLE OKAY. THANK YOU. A QUESTION WAS TOUCHED ON JUST BRIEFLY. SO I'M GLAD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. IF I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU IS IF THIS IS WHAT BIG QUESTIONS A PHYSICIST HAS TO ANSWER INTRIGUED BE WRONG BECAUSE THERE IS NO CHOICE OR FREE AND YOU CAN PREDICT EVERYTHING. IF I AM AN EVIL HACKER WITH RANSOMWARE LIKE IT OR NOT, I COULD MAKE TWO OPINIONS I COULD AWFUL DEED, LOOKING BACK I HAVE NO CHOICE DO IT NUMBER 2 WHICH IS WORSE IS I COULD SAY, SPLITTING OFF ALL THE TIME EVERY POSSIBLE SO WHY DON'T I DO AND GET THE BENEFIT IN MY WHO BELIEVES IN MANY-WORLDS THEORY STRIVE [ LAUGHTER ] IT. THE SHORT ANSWER TO THAT IS READ CHAPTER NINE [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE READ CHAPTER NINE. HERE IS THE LONGER ANSWER. IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU I SUGGEST YOU IMPLEMENT THIS LEAF IN YOUR WANT TO HAVE FOR DINNER, WITH THE LAWS OF DO YOU LOVE ME? I DON'T KNOW WHATEVER THE LAWS OF PHYSICS I PREDICT YOU WILL NOT GET VERY FAR IN YOUR AND I CAN EXPLAIN WHY IT IS BECAUSE THERE THE WORLD THAT IT WILL BE DIFFERENT RULES. THERE IS A VOCABULARY FOR TALKING ABOUT THE AND REDUCTIONISTIC WHERE YOU HAVE THE WAVE EQUATION. AND INDEED NOT VOCABULARY THERE IS NO SUCH IT IS DETERMINISTIC IT DOES WHAT IT DOES. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER VOCABULARY IF YOU'RE PLANETS AND PUPPIES AND CHOICES AND OPINIONS AND DID NOT VOCABULARY, THINGS ARE NOT DETERMINED ABOUT THE WAVE FUNCTION OF THE UNIVERSE. AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE CHOICES. I SUGGEST YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE. [ APPLAUSE ]. THANK YOU . I WAS JUST WONDERING IF THERE WAS -- YOU SAID THERE IS A SPLITTING OF THE UNIVERSE I'M WONDERING THE MANY-WORLDS THEORY HAS LIKE PREDETERMINED YES, NO. YES, NO. THE THICKNESS OF THIS DIAGRAM IS SUPPOSED WEIGHTS THAT GO INTO THIS. VERY TYPICALLY WHEN WE ARE GIVING THIS EXAMPLE UP OR SPIN DOWN WE ARE OFTEN GIVEN AN EXAMPLE BETWEEN SPIN UP AND SPIN DOWN YOU SEE THERE WE AUCTIONS FOR SPINS WHERE IT IS ONE THIRD TO BE SPIN DOWN. THAT IS A PUZZLE FOR EVERETTIANS WHERE THIS THE ONLY DIFFERENCES THE WEIGHT IS DIFFERENT. AND I THINK THERE ARE VERY GOOD ARGUMENTS 22nd ANSWER. WHEN THE SPLITTING HAPPENS, EXACTLY BECAUSE SPLITTING ALWAYS HAPPENS BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. SO EVEN THOUGH THIS PERSON HERE CAN PREDICT OF THEM THERE AND A COPY OF THEM THEY ARE, A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN THESE TWO PEOPLE DON'T OUT THERE IS A UNIQUELY SENSIBLE WAY TO ASSIGN BRANCH AND IT IS A WAVE ACTION SQUARE. OKAY. YES I HEAR MUMBLING. [ LAUGHTER ] I HAVE THE TWO PARTNER. ON HOW TO WORLD SPLIT IN TWO HOW DOES YOUR FLAWS AND COPENHAGEN INTERPRETATIONS. HAD A WAVE FUNCTION SPLIT? IT IS EXACTLY MY ANSWERS DECOHERENCE, GOOD THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC MICROSCOPIC LEVEL, THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION. IT IS EXACT AND ALWAYS OBEYED IN THIS PICTURE. ALL ELSE IS COMMENTARY. THE DIVIDING UP OF THE WAVE FUNCTION INTO FOR COMING BEINGS IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY IS FULL OF ATOMS, PROTONS , HIGHER-LEVEL APPROXIMATE THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE MOMENT WHEN THE WAVE IT HAPPENS GRADUALLY OVER TIME . YOU SOLVE IS THIS REALLY PREPOSTEROUSLY TINY NUMBER THE WAY TO MAKE THAT QUANTITATIVE IS TO ASK ENTANGLED WITH THE AWAKE CAT IN THE ENVIRONMENT IT TAKE TO MAKE THEM GO PERPENDICULAR? THAT IS A VERY QUANTITATIVE QUESTION YOU CAN THAT IS WHEN THE MEASUREMENT HAPPENS. THE MEASUREMENT HAPPENS WHEN THE QUANTUM SYSTEM THE TWO ENVIRONMENT STATES ENTANGLED WITH . THANKS. SURE. SO, SUPPOSE YOU HAD TWO ENTANGLED PARTICLES PROBABILITY OF THEM BEING THERE AND YOU MEASURED KNOW THE OTHER IS SPIN UP? AND IF SO WOULDN'T THAT VIOLATE THE FACT THAT OF LIGHT? SO YES AND DEPENDS. [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS EXACTLY OF EINSTEIN'S GREAT CONTRIBUTIONS TO QUANTUM THERE IS A MYTH EINSTEIN WAS TOO OLD AND CURMUDGEONLY HE UNDERSTOOD IT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE, OF THE REASONS WHY BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE TWO AS YOU WANT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT MEASUREMENT OUTCOME YOU OF THEM YOU INSTANTLY KNOW WHAT THE OTHER THE PROBLEM IS, IT IS COMPLETELY USELESS FOR YOU HAVE MEASURED THIS ONE BUT THEY DON'T WHAT THE ANSWER IS. YOU HAVE TO SEND THEM THE INFORMATION ABOUT SIGNAL MOVING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT. RIGHT? SO THERE IS A NO SIGNALING THEREMIN QUANTUM ENTANGLEMENT TO SEND SIGNALS FASTER THAN THE IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING KIND OF HAPPENS FASTER CANNOT BE USED TO SEND INFORMATION . SHOULD IT IS UP TO YOU [ LAUGHTER ] I WILL NOT TELL LAST QUESTION. OH MY GOODNESS THE PRESSURE IS ON YOU. THIS IS A REALLY SIMPLE QUESTION NOW THAT SO, YOU HAVE BROUGHT UP A LOT OF REALLY INTERESTING BUT IF YOU COULD JUST SUM UP AND HELP US UNDERSTAND AND WE WOULD TRULY UNDERSTANDING? WHAT WOULD IT BE? OF THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION ACTUALLY. I THINK I WANT IT TO BE , THE THING I WANT NOW, PEOPLE ASK YOU ABOUT THIS TALK. AT THAT, SURE. IT IS NOT ANY FACT ABOUT QUANTUM MECHANICS IT IS THE ATTITUDE THAT THE JOB PHYSICS IS IT IS NOT JUST TO MAKE PREDICTIONS. PHYSICISTS POST ALL THE DIFFICULTIES IN QUANTUM INTO THE IDEA THAT PHYSICS IS NOT ABOUT REALITY. PHYSICS IS JUST ABOUT MAKING PREDICTIONS. I THINK IT IS A BAD ATTITUDE ANYTHING QUANTUM WE SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT LIKE WE SHOULD TO BIG BANG AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF PHYSICS THAT IS HER JOB AND WE CAN DO IT AS LONG AS THANK YOU [ APPLAUSE ] THANK YOU .
