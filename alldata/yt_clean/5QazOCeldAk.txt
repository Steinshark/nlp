I am putting these 15 speedrunners in a game of hide and seek tag! They get the whole game and are not out until they are caught. The last one caught wins $100. If all players are ready... 3.... 2... 1.. Go. [Mennis]: Go go go! [AirBrush]: No! I didn't want that! [LeySauce]: Lets go baby we're first! [LeySauce]: Movement! [Suigi]: (chuckle) Dude I can't get in. [Achilles]: I'm actually scared. [Super]: Oh god dude. [Scythamer]: Alright let's go, go in TTM baby! [YogoC]: I think Rainbow Ride might be popular. [N8rBeans]: (chuckle) Dude everyone's going upstairs. [Say Surprise]: We have so much time to hide man. [Badroenis]: Everyone's going upstairs, I don't know why. [Petalite]: Please, let me go in. [Inter]: Excuse me, coming through. [Needle]: (chuckle) Heh, we both have the same idea! [Jumbo]: (controller mashing) You guys time is up. Good luck guys, I am starting now. [Needle]: We gotta hide up here. [Needle]: This is the spot right here! [LeySauce]: No one else came into Wet Dry World with me man. [Petalite]: Alright cool put here. [Scythamer]: I'm so scared. [Suigi]: There we go. [Scythamer]: Come on, okay. [Scythamer]: No. [Suigi]: Just hold forward x2 [Scythamer]: Oh! [Suigi]: Just hold forward x2 [Scythamer]: Ok x2 I'm good. [Scythamer]: Ok, we're good. [Badroenis]: Because Toad is so short. [Badroenis]: I believe I can hide under a little ledge, where no one will look for me. [N8rBeans]: (chuckle) Oh my god it is so glitchy dude. [YogoC]: Don't get the STARRRRR [Mennis]: (laughter) [N8rBeans]: (laughing) Oh my god, no wayyyy. Some people after waiting around tend to make silly mistakes that they MIGHT regret. [Say Surprise]: Ooooooh... -le sad music- After aimlessly running around and scaring players, I eventually put someone in a tight situation. I heard someone move up there, I think someone's up there. [N8rBeans]: Dude do you think you can groundpound him off the carpet? [Mennis]: Do we either run or do you wanna try and actually hit him off? [YogoC]: I don't wanna try. I'm gonna chase after the first person that leaves the stage. [YogoC] I'm just gonna- I'm gonna jump over here. I see a toad down there &gt;:) [YogoC]: Oh he- I think he followed me. Yogo's gone, it's Yogo. [YogoC]: I'm here! He's exiting. [YogoC (15th)]: NooooOoOo..... The first person has been eliminated. YogoC. [Super]: No way! [Mennis]: We lost him... But, that's not our only announcement! With YogoC eliminated we are gonna be adding our first extra seeker. Sunk is gonna be joining us. [Say Surprise]: Alright, this is where it begins. [Inter]: Ha ha ha! Okay lets go back into Rainbow Ride and see if we can force anyone out of the stage as well. [Petalite]: Oh boy. [Inter]: Oh no. [Petalite]: Bye! Petalite exited, where is he going? [Petalite]: BBH, please. [Petalite]: Oh no he's here! [Petalite]: Please... Which one is he in- Oh! He's in the secret books! [Petalite]: Oh my god! No way! [Petalite]: He didn't see me! [N8rBeans]: Sunk entered, oh god. Haha. [N8rBeans]: Oooh nooo. [N8rBeans]: Oh my god. (chuckle) [N8rBeans]: Dude Sunk is on my trail. [N8rBeans]: Holy crap d- I just did the most 5Head thing of all time! [N8rBeans]: I went through the Boo door and I waited until he was gonna go through and I went through at the SAME time. [Inter]: Oh dear god. [Inter]: Oh god. [Inter]: Oh jesus. [Inter]: god...oh god.. [Inter]: Gotta blast! [Inter]: Oh god! [Inter (14th)]: I got caught... [Petalite]: There is actually no way dude. Meanwhile Mennis and N8r decided they would try something risky. [Mennis]: Sunk entered the level! [N8rBeans]: Oh my god alright. [Mennis]: I really wanna try and kick him. [N8rBeans]: Is it worth it? [Mennis]: I don't know. [N8rBeans]: Unless we jump down in the middle of the rainbow and just groundpound. [N8rBeans]: O-oh my god I kinda wanna risk it. [Mennis]: Alright he's- he's in the center now. [N8rBeans]: Okay I'm just gonna wait just a little bit. It's safe to say This did NOT work... [N8rBeans]: He's on the chase dude. [N8rBeans (13th)]: NOOO dude how did he see me?! [Mennis]: Did he get you? [Mennis]: Awww I'm sad now :( With Mennis losing both of his companions, we figured we would turn up the heat. N8rBeans has been caught. With his loss we're also gonna be bringing in our second seeker, Cheesy. [AirBrush]: Oh N8rBeans... [Needle]: I'm next I SWEAR I'm next. [Needle]: There's no f---ing way... [Achilles]: We got three- three seekers. [LeySauce]: There's three of them now. [Needle]: OOOH s---, Bizzare is in here! I have a suspicion someone MIGHT be in here somewhere. [Needle]: MonkaW You can hide in the clouds pretty easily. [Super]: Needle what did you do bro. [Needle]: Oh he's coming up- [Needle]: He's coming up here! x2 [Needle]: Oh my god I'm scared [Needle]: scared x5 [Needle]: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- [Super]: Byeeeee. Oh! There he is- two Toads right here! What?! There's two Toads here! [Super]: Oh HELL naw. [Needle]: Oh my god. x4 Only because they moved, I would've probably just walked right past them. [Super]: My heart is absolutely RACING bro. Someone went into THI I believe. Oooh- Needle left, he was about to get caught there. [Needle]: Oh my god- Oh my f---ing god I'm outta here! [Needle]: Okay. [Needle]: I'm safe. [Needle]: This is the spot! Right here. [Petalite]: So anyway as I was saying, here's my decapitated Mario. Attention players! We are now adding YogoC as another seeker. [Achilles]: Oh lord four seekers... [Mennis]: Yogo was hiding with me... [Badroenis]: He's in the level. [LeySauce]: Oh f--- my a-- dude. [Badroenis]: I just really wanna see what happens when he comes into this room and just- [Badroenis]: -runs straight into Metal Cap. [Badroenis]: Like will he check the corners? [LeySauce]: This is where it could happen. [Badroenis]: Oh! Yogo looks to be swimming normally, but LeySauce saw something ENTIRELY different on his screen. [LeySauce]: Dude run! [LeySauce]: Run! x5 [Badroenis]: No! Oh my god... [Badroenis (12th)] [LeySauce]: Alright down to HMC. [Cheesy]: Hold on- Hold on! [Cheesy]: Somebody's in basement! x2 [LeySauce]: NOOOOO [LeySauce]: NOOO [LeySauce]: NOOoooo.... [Cheesy]: I got him. [LeySauce (11th)]: Come on man! [Super]: &quot;Sunk has entered your level.&quot; [Super]: (sarcasm) Niceeeee, nice bro, nice..... [Super]: I should've left when I had the chance dude... [Super]: Sunk le- [Super]: NO WAY [Super]: No way! That's a miracle. [Super]: That is a miracle and a HALF right there- -da vine boom- [Super]: F- [Super]: Oh my god.... [Super]: Hi. [Sunk]: I know where you are. [Sunk]: You can't hide from me. [Super]: I'm not- [Cheesy]: God, I was hoping I could get him in time... [Super]: HOW. [Super]: how... [Cheesy]: Where'd he go? [Super]: I somehow evaded TWO Mario's at the SAME time! With Super barely escaping this chase, we began to place more pressure on the hiders. [Needle]: They're climbing. [Needle]: They're climbing! [Needle]: T- They made it. [Needle]: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA [Cheesy]: I did- I knew it, I knew it! [Needle]: I'm- I'm so dead. [Cheesy]: Somebody's on Castle Grounds! [Needle]: (scream) [Needle]: Cheesy found me! Motherf---er. [Cheesy]: Ok he's inside the castle somewhere. [Needle]: I don't know why I went in here, I panicked. [Needle]: I don't know where to go like- [Needle]: I actually do not know any places to go. [Petalite]: Alright you. [Petalite]: Person that's watching this video. (That's you.) [Petalite]: Lets do Rock-Paper-Scissors right now, and if you lose you have to subscribe! [Petalite]: Rock. Paper. Scissors. Shoot! [Petalite]: Did you lose? [Petalite]: If you picked Paper you better hit that subscribe button right now- -hit- [Petalite]: Ow- [Petalite]: Get out of my level. [Petalite]: Oh, no. Are you going back there? [Petalite]: Oh, he's in here now. [Petalite]: There is no god---- way man. [Petalite]: There's just no way. [Petalite]: Oh he's punching the little corners. [Petalite]: Why- [Petalite]: are there THREE people here. Why is there always just one person in BBH while there's a ton of people seeking 'em. [Petalite]: Dude they're gonna find me, there's literally three people here. [Petalite]: (laughing) [Petalite]: Dude it's too good man. [Petalite]: There are four people looking for just this one little measly Toad. [Petalite]: Five?! [Petalite]: All the seekers are here! [Petalite]: Literally every seeker is in this level. [Petalite]: Why me?! [Petalite]: Why do you do this to me man. [Petalite]: This is so mean. (chuckle) [Petalite]: ...! [Petalite]: Oh my god he saw me. [Petalite]: He saw me. [Petalite]: Oh he saw me. [Badroenis]: Alright. [Cheesy]: Oh it's him. Oh he left! [YogoC]: Oh he left. [Petalite]: Don't make sounds. [Petalite]: Just go behind BITS. [Petalite]: They found me, they actually found me. [Petalite]: Dude I hear sliding doors. [Petalite]: Oh f---! [Petalite (10th)]: Noooooo!!! [Petalite (10th)]: D---it. With five of us now seeking, the hiders were struggling to stay out of sight. [AirBrush]: Okay, cool! [Mennis]: Oh no. [Sunk]: Mennis is in CCM. [Mennis]: (gasp) [Mennis]: No... Oooh I just saw someone! What? What's happening here? He decided to break my ankles here. [Mennis]: Just leave me alone :( [Sunk]: Whomps Fortress. [Mennis]: Please. Oh I see them. Nope he's re-entering. [Mennis]: (exhale) How- How did I miss that...? [Cheesy]: Oh there's a Toad. [Mennis]: Holy s--- that the- [Mennis]: -worst place to go... [Mennis (9th)]: Ah okay we got- [Mennis (9th)]: we got- [Mennis (9th)]: -he got me. [Mennis (9th)]: I couldn't do much more than that. While Mennis was being eliminated, back in TTC there was still a search going on. [AirBrush]: Oh no! Mennis got caught. No... [N8rBeans]: Yogo I'm gonna die and just make sure- [N8rBeans]: Wait they're right there! [N8rBeans]: They're on top of the pendulum! [AirBrush]: I don't know if they're gonna come down from above. [AirBrush]: We're leaving. [AirBrush]: !!! Oh! Oh there's someone right here, is that AirBrush? I'm after AirBrush here. And it seems he's exiting. [AirBrush]: Oh wow, did we really get away from there? [AirBrush]: (laughing) Can't believe we juked them. [Cheesy]: Did he go- he must've went in Vanish Cap. [AirBrush]: Is Cheesy here? I don't really remember. [AirBrush]: Uh, I don't really know where to go now. [N8rBeans]: There's someone in Wet Dry World I'm gonna go down to the town. Funny enough, N8rBeans and Yogo did not notice AirBrush here for a good amount of time. [AirBrush]: How did they not see me? [YogoC]: Oh they're in the Vanish Cap area! [AirBrush]: There's no way he does not see me now. [AirBrush (8th)]: Nooo, d---it! More than half of the contestants have been eliminated. A lot of players remaining have either escaped effortlessly, or just haven't been found yet! Lets see how long their luck lasts... [Say Surprise]: Bizzare is here. [Say Surprise]: Oh- [Say Surprise]: No x9 We're gonna go check down here in the door room. This is a very easy location to hide in. 'Cause not many people go down here. There are coins missing...! [Say Surprise]: He's totally coming, he knows where to go. [Say Surprise]: He's here. Oh, I see him! S---. [Badroenis]: Oh! He just went into the Toad! [Say Surprise]: That was fricking nuts dude. [Say Surprise]: They was like three or four- there was like two or three of them on me. [Suigi]: Dude what if we are the last two left? And we're here? What are we gonna do? [Suigi]: Like are we just gonna- -the boom of the vine- [Scythamer]: Oh my god. [YogoC]: There's two people in TTM. [Scythamer]: Ugh I'm so f---ing scared. [Suigi]: There's three now okay. [Scythamer]: Okay man, okay. [Scythamer]: Dude! [Suigi]: Go away x2 [Scythamer]: There's like four people. [Suigi]: Oh! Ok x4 [Suigi]: (sigh) [Scythamer]: Ok! [Suigi]: Oh! x4 [Suigi]: Oh they're f---ing here, they're f---ing here. [Scythamer]: Leave? [Suigi]: I'm leaving. [Scythamer]: Oh my god! [Scythamer]: (breathes) [Scythamer]: PLEASE [Scythamer]: Alright where are we going? [Scythamer]: Where are we going? [Suigi]: Uh, I'm- I'm just going to Metal Cap room again. [Suigi]: F---ing Scuttlebug dude. [Suigi]: You KILLED me! [Scythamer]: Did I hit you? [Scythamer]: Oh my god. [Suigi]: Oh my god x6 [YogoC]: Someone's chasing a Toad? Think they went downstairs? [Suigi]: They're f---ing chasing me. [Scythamer]: No f---ing way, I am SO sorry. [Suigi]: O-o-oh my god... [Sunk]: Go- go into the Castle Grounds [Suigi]: I'm going to Vanish Cap. [Suigi]: Hey YogoC is- is chasing me. [YogoC]: Suigi just left Vanish Cap. [Cheesy]: Yep he's going to basement! [Suigi]: Dude! F--- off! [Badroenis]: I'm in basement. [Badroenis]: To uh- HMC! HMC. [Suigi]: Oh my god Badroenis just entered. [Badroenis]: Toad just going into the rock room! [Suigi]: They're RIGHT behind be bro. [Scythamer]: Exit course if you can and like go to JRB or something. [YogoC]: He left! [Sunk]: JRB! [Suigi]: I'm- I will never forgive you bro. He's in JRB. [Cheesy]: Yep there he is! [Cheesy] He left! x2 He left. [Cheesy] He's going downstairs again. [Suigi]: Dude they're literally right behind me. [Say Surprise]: Oh my gosh they're all's- [Suigi]: Are they ever gonna get off my A-- bro. [Scythamer]: Are you still alive? -cornelius vine boom the third- Oh! Someone's in Metal Cap! [Scythamer]: Oh my god BizzareScape's in here. Someone's in here. Scythamer exited at the exact same time as Suigi. This could not have been WORSE timing, since everybody chasing Suigi- -redirected their attention to HIM. [Scythamer]: I saw you. [Cheesy]: There's a Toad just entering upstairs. [Scythamer]: (exhale) AAAAAAAAA- [Scythamer]: (nearly breaks the sound barrier) [Scythamer]: Dude. [Scythamer]: Go. [Scythamer]: I am so f---ing scared. [Cheesy]: Basement! x2 [Scythamer]: Go! Please! I'm begging you. [Cheesy]: Oh he's screwed if I enter first. [Scythamer]: OH [Scythamer]: Oh my god get f---ed! [Cheesy]: G- Go the other way. x3 [Scythamer]: I'm just like running around. [Scythamer]: I feel like I'm f---ed. [Scythamer]: I'm so f---ed dude I'm gonna be honest with you. [Suigi]: There's still seven hiders left, these hiders must have the most BANGING hiding spots EVER. [Scythamer]: Where the f--- are these people dude?! -gets hit- [Scythamer]: YOU GOTTA BE KID- [Scythamer (7th)]: I'm out, I just got out. [Suigi]: Aaahhh f---, I'm sorry dude... Earlier while Suigi was being chased, he entered Shifting Sand Land where Super was hiding. And the seekers knew to come back for him. [Super]: (groan) Why Suigi why?!?! [Super]: I gotta actually pay attention now. [Super]: I hear him he's in. [Super]: He probably knows I'm in the Eyerock boss room, there's no way he doesn't. [Super]: Oh, he's down here. [N8rBeans]: Yogo, you're in SSL right? [YogoC]: Yeah. [YogoC]: Oh I found a Toad :D -biggest fumble in history- -facepalm- [Super]: (laughing/disbelief) [YogoC]: Oh my god he's in- (chuckle) he's just ledgegrabbing and I thought I can hit him! [Super]: My controller was dead! [Super]: How did he not get me?! [Super]: Oh my god I actually lucked out. [N8rBeans]: Going in HMC. [Suigi]: O-oh my god no way. [Cheesy]: There's a Toad right here going to upstairs! [Suigi]: Go away now. [N8rBeans]: There's a Toad on Dorrie in- HMC star one. [N8rBeans]: Going to Metal Cap. [Super (6th)]: D---... [N8rBeans]: Oh, I got him! [Cheesy]: SL? [Suigi]: Oh my god. Holy f---! These are the final five on the run. Each runner has had their fair share of escapes or smart decisions to remain unseen. However, there are currently eight seekers running around, narrowing their movements significantly. [Cheesy]: Yep he's upstairs, he's going to tippy! [Cheesy]: He's in one of the th- four stages upstairs, I'm not sure which one. [Cheesy]: Yeah- -gets kicked to oblivion- [N8rBeans]: Oh, whoops! (chuckle) [Cheesy]: Why did you kick me?! [N8rBeans]: I was trying to buffer kick to do the triple jump! [Petalite]: Is the Toad just in the Big House? [Sunk]: I will- uh find I don't know. [Petalite]: Uh- The Toad is in the Big House! [Petalite]: I see him! [Petalite]: Suigi left the level! He left the level. [Cheesy]: He's going to basement! [Cheesy]: I'm on his tail. x2 [Suigi]: Nooooooo.... that's it. [Cheesy]: I got him! I GOT HIM! [Suigi (5th)] [Achilles]: Wha- [Achilles]: Suigi's gone? [Needle]: Suigi?! No way! [Say Surprise]: No way GreenSuigi's out. [YogoC]: There's one Toad in DDD by the way star one. [Say Surprise]: Oooh, Yogo's in my level. [Say Surprise]: And Cheesy, they're all coming after me, I'm next. [YogoC]: Yeah I'm looking for the Toad in the second one. [Say Surprise]: Alright lets do this boys. [Say Surprise]: Bring it. [Jumbo]: Yikes... [Say Surprise]: My hands are so sweaty dude. [Achilles]: Nooooo Bizzare, Bizzare's coming here. I'm gonna guess that Achilles is the one who's hiding in TTM. 'Cause I haven't of Achilles and this person's been in TTM for a while. [Achilles]: Do I hear a Mario? [Achilles]: F--- it I'mma leave. Oh it was Achilles! I was right, it's been Achilles this whole time! [Achilles]: Oh s---! [Badroenis]: Oh! Toad in Castle Grounds! [Badroenis]: Going toward vanish. [Achilles]: Don't choke! x2 He's running again in Dark World. [Achilles]: Ok lets go. [Jumbo (4th)] [Achilles]: Jumbo- Wait they got Jumbo! Oh there he is! He's right there! x3 [Achilles]: I may be next. [Needle]: We're gonna do this guys. I have confidence. [Needle]: We're in top three. We got this. [Say Surprise]: Top three, I don't know how this happened. But I'm in top three, somehow. [Achilles]: Oh s---! [Achilles]: F---! [Cheesy]: Achilles is going to basement! [Achilles]: Oh! [Achilles]: No! [Achilles]: (breaks the sound barrier) [Cheesy]: I got him! I got Achilles! Achilles is done! [Achilles (3rd)]: Oh noooo..... [Say Surprise]: Achilles gotten? No way dude. [Needle]: OOOOOOOOOH [Needle]: Bro... [Needle]: Bro we're at top two now. [Needle]: We're actually at top two. You guys are down to the final two. Say Surprise and Needlemouse. [N8rBeans]: Oh I see them! They're on the- where the blue coin platform is for hundred coin. [N8rBeans]: How do you get there without the sub dude? [Petalite]: You use the poles! x2 [Say Surprise]: They know I'm here. [N8rBeans]: They're in the blue coin switch! [Say Surprise]: Everyone's here! Everyone's after me! [Needle]: Say Surprise, it's him. [Needle]: He's chasing Say Surprise! Oh it's over. It's over. [Cheesy]: Does anybody know where that Toad went? [Say Surprise]: My heart is pounding so hard. (chuckle) [Say Surprise]: This is nuts. [N8rBeans]: Nobody in HMC. [Petalite]: Yeah I-I'm checking Dark World right now. [Say Surprise]: This is a terrible spot, I should really move. [Say Surprise]: But I'm terrified someone's gonna enter, right as soon as I go. [Say Surprise]: Oookay. Calm down. Calm down. [N8rBeans]: There's one in uh BBH. [Petalite]: Wait really? [Needle]: There's a Mario literally right there. Holy s---. If I had to guess, I think the winner's gonna be hiding somewhere in the castle. [Needle]: I hear them, they're trying to go for it. [Needle]: Guys. x5 [Needle]: No- no- We're good. x4 [Needle]: We're good. [Needle]: We're good! Oh my god! [Needle]: (scream) [Needle]: That was BizzareScape too! [Needle]: Let's f---ing go! Ooooh I see someone there! Say Surprise is right here! [Mennis]: Going downstairs. [N8rBeans]: Going around. x2 [Petalite]: Uh- Where are they? x2 [Petalite]: Oh I see them! x2 [Petalite]: They die! (chuckle) [Say Surprise (2nd)]: Noooo, he got me. [Needle (1st)]: NO WAYYYY [Needle (1st)]: (I don't get paid enough to write his scream) No way Say Surprise! (chuckle) [Say Surprise (2nd)]: They got meeeeee (groan). [Needle (1st)]: WHAAAAAAAA- [Needle (1st)]: Oh my god I f---ing won! [Needle (1st)]: Let's f---ing go!!! Congratulations on first place. You survived through every single person there. [Needle (1st)]: Yes!!! You're the winner of the $100 prize AND outclassed some of the BEST Mario runners that we have here.
