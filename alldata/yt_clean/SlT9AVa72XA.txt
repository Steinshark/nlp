- We are just hardly above the terrain at the moment. (dramatic music) We'll make this turn right, And then again, over here, and this is where our We never continue. If this area is cloudy, and you're unable to see the mountains. So, this is a very critical point. - [Computer] 500. - [Sam] Good morning. I am with Mr. Saddam He's driving me on the And today's a big day for me. I've been waiting for this for many years, going to the Northern area of Skardu. (upbeat music) - [Majid] My name is captain Majid Akhtar, from PIA, flying the ATR 42-500, and with me today is captain Satib Hamid. - Hello. - [Majid] And he's getting familiarised with the route today, and then he'll be flying on his own. So these check ride, as well Flight time is about an and approach procedure's but the tricky part is actually The Zulu bend is like a Z. And we have basically one, It's very tricky, and this captain's decision especially flying to the Northern areas. - [Sam] The whole flight is VFR? - [Majid] Absolutely, the We cannot be inside the clouds, especially near the mountains. (plane engine roaring) (indistinct speech) (machine beeps) (upbeat house music) - [Majid] Right now, we're in clear direct to position (indistinct), which is actually where the So at the moment, we're and the Tarbela Dam on the left hand side. - [Sam] Have an orange juice. Thank you. So I'm sitting in this This is actually the reverse facing seat, and now the mountains are here, and it's getting very scenic. - [Majid] You can see and that's the Indian Haramosh straight away, and this is a Rakaposhi Two main peaks. So today we're flying the normal route, because the visibility is excellent, and from here, we'll And the turning point is Position Punji. It's called this Counter Punji. From Punji, if you take a left turn, you'll go to Gilgit. If you take a right So, we are just hardly, maybe two or 3000 feet above (dramatic music) - [Majid] You can actually It's quite difficult to tell. It's a very perfect shape That's actually K2. Basically, we made a right and now we're descending and it's all VFR, and this is the point where If you see that area, is blocked by clouds, this is the time you make a right turn, and you go back to Islamabad. So we never continue and it's filled with clouds, and you're unable to see the mountains. So this is a very critical point. Basically, we have this landmark up here, and we call it the saddle. You know the horse saddle? It's a flat area, and it's That is the time where That is a very tight turn. So what we do is we keep our speed low, and we try and stay on profile, and then we make this turn. This is known as the We're coming this way. So we make this turn right, And then again, over here, and this is where our So this turn is this first one here. And this one is also a very tight turn. So here, we must have and then we start et cetera, early. (machine beeping) (dramatic music) - [Computer] 500. (indistinct radio chatter) (dramatic music) - Sam, welcome to Skardu.

We just saw the A320 and final approach into Skardu It's actually different to ATR flight came from behind me, and they did a very steep descent, coming down through the mountain. (upbeat music) - So colourful. Everybody turned up to board on the plane by stair one by one, and you can take as many and it's surreal, the backdrop. It's just so unreal.

It is 7,300, and due our performance is compromised, so we have to take longer, take and the cloud performance (indistinct radio chatter) (dramatic music) (plane engine roaring) (indistinct radio chatter) - (indistinct) altitude. - [Man] Check. (upbeat house music) (indistinct) - So, you just had a view of K2. And we're lucky we have but just take Karakoram's to the right. Over here, this one's (indistinct). They're about, 21,000, 19,500.
