If you found this tape, it means Or working at a different office. How did this happen? Well, I'll tell ya. Buckle up! Buckaroos. Today's lesson is the misfired launch of Fallout 76. June 2018. It began with everyone getting [Todd Howard] &quot;Have we waited long enough, guys?&quot; [Internet Historian] Oh, God, yes we have, Todd! [Todd] &quot;Think we have-.&quot; [IH] Fallout 76. Bethesda's biggest game yet. MY GOD, it was exciting and they promised we'd E3 hype time! The press conference! 16 times the detail!! [Todd] &quot;16 times the detail.&quot; &quot;All new rendering, lighting, [IH] 4 times the map size! [Todd] &quot;It is 4 times the size of Fallout 4.&quot; &quot;And it's our biggest one yet.&quot; [IH] My God, it was excitinggg! November 14, 2018. The game goes live, with a day one patch of 50 gigabytes. [Text-to-speech] &quot;For fuck's sake.&quot; &quot;I'll see you tomorrow.&quot; [IH] But once that's downloaded, people start logging into the And, oh dear lord, they And there are so many of them. Goodbye, world. Goodbye, necks. Goodbye, body. Goodbye, heads. Bugs, bugs, bugs, everywhere. Server crashes. Game crashes. Old bugs imported from Fallout 4. Use more than one nuke at a time? Textures far too texturous. An all-consuming void. Error log 3:0:7. Can't pick up stuff. Can't stop asserting dominance with a T-pose. Frame rate problems. Screen tear problems. Getting too swole. Getting underneath the map. Getting attacked by invisible enemies. Spawning too many enemies. &quot;Kinda speaks for itself.&quot; Spawning too many god rays. Also, your C.A.M.P. resets after every session and sometimes it goes underwater. Holotapes randomly play static, but too many holotapes mean Enemy AI is far more A than I. Animations are broken. Surprise! Floating objects and a Traveling Merchant. Just to name a few. Joseph Anderson has a great video that documents That video is THREE hours long. But it gets worse. Error CE-34878-0 can corrupt your data and force you A few PC players had their Also, when the date rolled over the nukes in the game stopped No one thought it prudent to program in And a few players were straight-up logging This guy had a level 78 character that was Bethesda said they couldn't Many players are... not thrilled with this game, and they want Bethesda to know that. And they want everyone else to know that, too. But Bethesda owns the platform. &quot;Is Fallout 76 fun?&quot; [Text-to-speech] &quot;YES IT IS.&quot; &quot;Banned for racism.&quot; &quot;Thread locked.&quot; [IH] They had no direct outlet for their rage. The only solution was to put Reddit. Twitter. Bethesda's other games on Steam. The backlash was immense... but surely level heads would prevail. The reviewers would come out and *Kaboom* Oh, dear lord, they hated it. This is so sad. Despacito, play Country Roads. Almost heaven, West Virginia~ Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River And the YouTube community &quot;It's really f*cking boring.&quot; &quot;Could barely bring myself to play &quot;No one on staff wants to play &quot;Not gonna... subject myself to another &quot;In short, Fallout 76 is morally, technically, [IH] The mods on Bethesda forums The mods on Reddit almost gave up. Look, I'm not saying that some people didn't But what I AM saying is that the Metacritic So what happened? Well, it came out that development The deadlines were tight... too tight. ( deg ? deg) Plus, this wasn't Bethesda's A-team. It's actually a relatively inexperienced And the scope of the game [Todd] &quot;We're gonna need [Text-to-speech] &quot;Hey Todd, I stayed [Todd] &quot;We're gonna need [Text-to-speech] &quot;Please. Todd. No more.&quot; [Todd] &quot;We're gonna need 4 times the size of Fallout 4.&quot; [IH] That, and they were trying to patchwork the old What else could you expect? &quot;That's why I give my kids Fallout 76.&quot; [crash] Now, Bethesda could tolerate the bugs and but what they couldn't tolerate were the exploits. Infinite inventory. Infinite invisibility. The frame rate was tied to the game speed, so Server hopping for more items. Infinite cash and infinite duplication. Unlimited XP. Unlimited nuking. (The nuclear codes were unencrypted and And someone was given the curse Naturally, this can really mess with so Bethesda was ready with the banhammer... [Todd] &quot;This just works.&quot; [IH] ...and a blindfold to wildly flail around and But Bethesda wasn't satisfied No. They're a progressive company They wanted to give a road to redemption. So support sent out this email &quot;We would be willing to accept an essay on 'why the use of third-party cheat software is That's right. 500 words on why you're a very naughty boy and they may just give you your account back. But a couple of days later, the mocking from news One more exploit. In all the Bethesda games, Every item in the game is kept here. Security has to be top-notch, someone could just waltz in and take and it would be an absolute disast- Well, shit. Of course, Bethesda wasn't equipped People started flooding in, taking then selling those items on At first, they tried the usual approach: (Pump that 12 Gauge in me Daddy Todd) banning people who had some You spent 700 hours just Die, cheater! Next, they put in a system where players would and they banned those players. That wasn't much better, because people Get in quick with a level 1 account, get all that good shit, then get the fuck out. Then use a duplication glitch to Then transfer that stuff to your main Bethesda then takes out this level 1 And you've just beaten the game. So the problem continued. Bethesda is running out There's a lot of speculation in the media and among but no one except for the exploiters That said, Bethesda needs to act fast before So they wrote another email [clears throat] &quot;Uh, hello, cheater. Do you want to tell us how you did it, Should we not hear back from you, the It's not known whether this approach worked, but from what I've seen, it's still November 22, 2018. Just a week after the release, From $60, to $40... to $35... to $30. You can find it for $15 on eBay and in Germany they're straight-up giving it for Also, some stores are just zip-tying it to other products. But to Bethesda, it's worth selling because it brings people into the Atomic Shop (which is where the real margins are), and it inflates the poor sales figures. Let's have a look at those. The latest figures show 76 sold less Not good. There's also been a massive oversupply Although what's the point of a hard copy telling you to redeem an online code? And while sales are low, returns are high. Immediately upon release, people began 76 is not on Steam. It's on so they have all the control. If players only played the game for a few hours, However, it came out that people were sometimes Quite generous! But then word about this Then to Reddit, and a post got 12 1/2 thousand upvotes, informing people that this made pretty and the comments told them Bethesda was flooded with And their response? &quot;Shut it down, lads!&quot; &quot;No! No! No one gets a refund now! &quot;Robot customer service man engage!&quot; [Text-to-speech] &quot;Customers who have downloaded We apologize for the inconvenience. DIE-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-&quot; [IH] A few things followed. First, people got mad. One hardcore gamer even trashed a Thank you for calling GameStop. This is Brian how can I help you? A bit of an overreaction... but probably also fake. Second, the media. And third, a class-action lawsuit. Their inconsistent refund policy and terms November 27, 2018. Migliaccio &amp; Rathod LLP filed a class-action Media quickly picked up on that. Their main argument is that it's a sometimes that they're refusing refunds, and that Bethesda is engaged in and then slowly patch their way Updates on this lawsuit are slow, so I'll keep [Ad time.] Look, there's a meteor headed Oh my God!

Please. curiositystream.com/internethistorian [Ad's over.] Let's rewind a little bit. Fallout fans made their pre-orders, and the most dedicated pre-ordered Wow. It came with a helmet, box, map, army toys, and a genuine West Tek canvas bag. [angelic choir] Fast-forward to the release... and customers notice that their precious bags, which are supposed to be made of look a bit... different. In fact, it looks like a carry bag Did they really just advertise one You can't do that! So there was a surge of backlash, and people began emailing Bethesda, asking for refunds, By this point, customer service They are done with the facade, and [Text-to-speech] &quot;Hello. We are sorry The bag shown in the media was a prototype We aren't planning on [IH] That's the whole email. Staff at Bethesda aren't even Naturally, the internet goes wild. [Y] &quot;Are you fucking kidding me?&quot; [TQ] &quot;Wow.., Wow..&quot; []&quot;I got so mad, I shaved &quot;Okay, guys, this is a bit of a PR nightmare. What do we do?&quot; &quot;Well, we've got this in-game currency. Let's just give them the &quot;FANTASTIC idea.&quot; &quot;Hear ye, hear ye! Anyone who paid $200-300 for the Power Armor Edition that you'll be able to spend with us.&quot; &quot;500 Atoms? Fuck yeah!&quot; - What are you gonna do with YOUR Atoms? - I'm gonna buy 5 eighteenths of the white - Whoaaa! - Light Wood Laminate, Light Wood - [gasp] Fuck the bag! [chanting &quot;Light Wood Laminate&quot;] Of course, this was Bethesda's What really happened is further outrage. And even the media started piling on. Almost heaven, West Virg- It even became part of that Bethesda put out a tweet apologizing and gave a different excuse for why A shortage of material, apparently. That was quickly debunked... because it turns out they DID except they gave them all Oh dear. It's not the same one, of course, but it's sourced from that canvas. But what's more amusing is that it turns if you don the postman's outfit. Which, of course, can be for 700 Atoms. Ooh. Just short. Well, the bleating from the online community continued, so they decided to capitulate. &quot;Alright, fine, we'll make your If you want to claim it, you'll have to fill out this form with your and we'll ship out the bag to you in 4-6 MONTHS.&quot; But it doesn't quite end there. Because Bethesda is known for bugs and of course their website is a buggy mess, too. Turns out all of the customer support inquiries In fact, people can open and Listed are details of full legal names, phone If you've requested your canvas bag, Not knowing how to immediately Bethesda panics and temporarily shuts And that is the tale of the Duffel Kerfuffle. How could this have been so difficult? One last piece of merch: a rum drink, Nuka-Cola Dark. Pre-order's available in September. Shipped out on November 14. $80 plus postage and handling. Not cheap. But in return, you got a very cool bootle. Looks good on the shelf. A great conversation piece with Or at least it would have been. November 14 came and went, Er, okay... A week later on November 21, There's a delay. &quot;Things aren't up to the usual &quot;the usual Fallout standards&quot; &quot;all of this just works&quot; &quot;things aren't up to the usual Fallout sta-&quot; &quot;So we'll have it for you soon.&quot; No specific date given. Nothing. Then on December 5, another email. &quot;Good news! We start shipping on December 12.&quot; It's been nearly 3 months since you pre-ordered, but as a show of good faith, we made And this is where things went Right there. Did you catch that? That's just a regular industry bottle and a plastic shell. We paid $80 and waited a quarter People were not happy. Look at that ratio. Nothing in the marketing said that it was a plastic shell. &quot;SUPER PREMIUM&quot;, we were promised. And the media agreed. People began cancelling their orders. Silver Screen tries to convince people &quot;It actually cost us twice as much to make Then what the fu- &quot;We spent a hundred hours coding the design.&quot; Convincing stuff. So it arrives, just a few days before Christmas. The rum is about the quality you'd expect. &quot;Oh god. Can I swear on this? It's my own show. Agh.&quot; Worse is the design. The oversized lip means liquid &quot;Hard to pour 'cause... of how &quot;I spilled like half the shot.&quot; &quot;Very dribbly...&quot; So you're best off opening the whole If you do that, there's a good chance Any liquid will immediately ruin Some made their own at home, and But look, if you do want a decent version of this They're on Etsy. They're far cheaper, Not gonna lie, though. Some of the memes Now, many claim that this &quot;Sorry...&quot; ...or that customers were at fault for I disagree. All of the marketing shows other glass items. All of the mock-ups show something more They give plenty of descriptions of the product, too, And they were engaged in a bunch Before the product was even available, they flooded This raised some eyebrows, and people so they deleted them. You can see all this activity Now, if they're happy to it seems silly to give them the benefit It's also worth quickly talking about Some of these items are pretty neat. That's cool. Good idea. I'd have that. Fallout 76 pant. Singular. But why is he so mad? The photography is all just slightly... off. This gaudy jacket was mocked But does the 76 in $276 And why did they just toss it on the ground? And it comes in this crumpled-up toddler body bag. You're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars Why is she wearing the size XXL? But who looked at this and said: &quot;Good job. Print.&quot; Now that's surprising. And what the fuck- They made the bottle properly! Yeah! One of THOSE, please, but bigger and brown! Is that SO hard? Let's get back to the game. December 2018. There are two new patches First, the good. For PC, they included a number of quality-of-life [Squidward saying future twice] But also brought in field of view sliders. Hooray. Increased stash capacity from and a small buff to automatic weapons. Hooray. They decreased the carry weight of bobby pins so [Todd] &quot;I got a box of bobby pins the [IH] There were also upgrades to the C.A.M.P. and a bunch of bug fixes. Hoo-ray. The bad. A whole bunch of unannounced They generally made the game grindier. Ammo production was decreased. Fusion cores burned out faster. Legendary enemies spawned less frequently. [Text-to-Skyrim-chicken] &quot;En garde. I'll f-ck you up.&quot; [IH] And the backlash was significant, because everybody knew why to encourage people to use the Atomic Shop. And let's talk briefly about that store. Some of the prices are outrageous. A Christmas tree for $12. A Santa outfit for $20. Blue and yellow paint for $18. Oh, look - $3 for the same sweater vest and But the biggest offense of all $24 for some Christmas-themed emotes. Twice the price of these games. The media agreed that these But worse, they're engaged in some Oh, look! It's marked down half price! But it's not. It was RELEASED half price. They're artificially jacking up the price, only in order to create a sense of urgency. That's illegal. (Here in Australia, at least, Reddit quickly picked up on Bethesda reacted by scrapping the &quot;discount&quot; and Okay, it's been about 25 minutes of whining I didn't even get a chance to touch the new camera item that lets you teleport, dwindling player numbers... But, on the flip side, they're also adding new content Heck, No Man's Sky was a surprising comeback. So... maybe Bethesda can do it too. But for now... Todd returns to cryostasis... hiding in his bunker until the bombs and returning only when it's time... to get our hopes up once again.
