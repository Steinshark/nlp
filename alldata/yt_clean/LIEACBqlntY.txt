Welcome to Jeremy's IT Lab. This is a free, complete course for the CCNA. If you like these videos, please subscribe Also, please like and leave a comment, and of videos. Thanks for your help. In this video we will cover two very 4 protocols. These protocols are mentioned in exam topic TCP to UDP. I could spend hours covering the details of you just need a high-level understanding of different. Here's what we'll cover in this video. First up, the basics of Layer 4. We've already covered a lot regarding Layers For example, at Layer 1 we covered the most At Layer 2 we covered things like MAC addresses, At Layer 3 we covered things like IP addresses Now I think is a good time to talk about Layer After a basic overview of Layer 4, I will After that, I will introduce UDP, User Datagram UDP is much simpler than TCP, and it's easiest Then we'll compare the two. Remember, that is the exam topic, compare As always, make sure to watch until the end from Boson ExSim, the best practice exams If you want to get Boson ExSim, follow the Okay, let's get started. So let's cover some basic functions of Layer First up, Layer 4 provides transparent transfer To briefly explain what that means, here's when I covered the OSI Model and TCP/IP Suite. This up here shows the network topology, with Transport Layer do? It encapsulates the data with a Layer 4 header, Layers 3, 2, and 1, to deliver the data unchanged The hosts themselves aren't aware of the of data is 'transparent' to them. Another function of Layer 4 protocols is to to applications. You'll soon see that TCP provides these not. What are some of these services? One is reliable data transfer. That means making sure that the destination it's supposed to. Another service is error recovery. If an error occurs in transmission, Layer Next is data sequencing, making sure that of order, the end host can sequence it in One more is flow control, making sure that than the destination host can handle. These are services provided by TCP but not I'll explain further later, so don't worry Okay, one more function of Layer 4 is to provide These addresses are called 'port numbers'. Note that the word 'port' can also refer to on network devices, but the Layer 4 port These port numbers provide a few functions, Layer protocol that is being used. Another is to provide something called 'session Let me explain these concepts. Here we have PC1, and it will access resources SRV2. Let's see how these ports are used to identify sessions between PC1 and the servers. First of all, what is a session? It's simply an exchange of data between And in your daily use of your PC, your PC sessions at once. Perhaps you have multiple Internet tabs open, You probably have multiple services running In PC1's case, let's say it is communicating At Layer 4 it is using TCP, and it uses a of 80. What are these ports used for? The destination port is very important, it For example, TCP port 80 is used for the protocol So, perhaps SRV1 is hosting a webpage that Now, how about the source port? It's randomly selected by PC1, and in combination the session. For example, after SRV1 receives PC1's message In SRV1's reply, notice that the source the source port is 80 and the destination When PC1 receives this message, the source it's part of the same communication session What if PC1 opens up a separate connection It might be using HTTP at destination port port. SRV1's response will use that source port so PC1 knows it's part of that session. But PC1 wants to access something on SRV2 It uses a TCP destination port number of 21, TCP port 21 is used for FTP, the File Transfer As the name suggests, it is used to transfer SRV2's reply will reverse the port numbers, port of 60000. These will tell PC1 that this communication Okay, I hope that gave you a basic understanding protocol, such as HTTP, the Hypertext Transfer or FTP, the File Transfer Protocol which is I also showed how these numbers are used by at once. The port numbers that Application Layer protocols Assigned Numbers Authority. They have designated the following ranges. Well-known port numbers are ports 0 through These are used for major protocols like HTTP, Registered port numbers are in the range 1024 Registration is required to use these port with the well-known port range. Finally, the range 49152 through 65535 is as private or dynamic ports. Hosts use this range when selecting the random Note that in the previous example, all of came from the ephemeral port range. Finally, note that port numbers are a function and UDP. Next I'll explain each of the protocols, earlier, reliable data transfer, error recovery, by TCP and not by UDP. First I'll explain TCP. I'll give an overview of it's functions, and then I'll go more in depth on a few First up, TCP is a connection-oriented protocol. What does that mean? Well, before actually sending data to the to establish a connection. Once the connection is established, the data The source host doesn't just start sending destination host and setting up this connection. Next, TCP provides reliable communication. How does it do that? The destination host must acknowledge that Remember, segment is the name of the Layer at Layer 2. Then, if the source host doesn't receive again. Next, TCP provides sequencing. In the next slide you'll see that there The sequence numbers in the TCP header allow order even if they arrive out of order. Okay, last thing for now, TCP provides flow That means that the destination host can tell rate that data is sent, so that it isn't it can process it. Okay, now let's take a look at the TCP header, As you can see, there are quite a few different provide all of those different services I The good news is, you don't have to learn I just want to briefly point out a few important First up, the source and destination port Note that each field is 16 bits, 2 bytes, That means there are a total of 65536, which The next two fields are the sequence number These two fields are used to provide sequencing in a bit more detail later. TCP has a series of 'flag' bits which I want to mention these three, ACK, SYN, and These three flags are used to establish and In the next slide I'll explain those processes The final field I want to point out is the This field is used for flow control, adjusting Okay, that's all for the TCP header. You don't have to learn every field or memorize I pointed out in this slide. I mentioned that TCP is connection-oriented, a connection before actually sending data. The method TCP uses to establish connections It has that name because it involves three So, let's say PC1 wants to access a webpage First, it must establish a TCP connection. To do so, it uses these two flags in the TCP acknowledgment, and SYN, meaning synchronization. First, PC1 will send a TCP segment to SRV1 set to 1. That is part one of the three-way handshake. Next, SRV1 will reply by sending a TCP segment So both bits are set to 1. That is part two of the three-way handshake. Finally, PC1 will send a TCP segment with Now the three-way handshake is complete and The real data exchange can then begin, the handshake, are just to establish a connection. Make sure to remember the three-way handshake. SYN, SYN-ACK, and then ACK. Now let's talk about how TCP terminates This process, sometimes called the TCP 'four-way handshake. When PC1 decides that it no longer needs the process to terminate the connection. The process uses these two flags in the TCP First, PC1 sends a TCP segment to SRV1 with SRV1 responds with an ACK. SRV1 then sends its own FIN. Finally, PC1 sends an ACK in response to SRV1's Here's the same summary I showed you before. So, can you see what 'connection-oriented' Before actually exchanging data, PC1 and SRV1 Okay, now let me demonstrate how TCP uses the header to provide reliable communication So, let's look at an exchange between two When PC1 sends the three-way handshake's number, let's say it sets it to 10. Then, when PC2 sends the SYN-ACK to PC1, it for example 50. Not only that, it also acknowledges that it of 10, by setting the acknowledgment field Why 11? That's because TCP uses something called Instead of acknowledging sequence number 10 sequence number of the next segment it expects So continuing that process, PC1 sends the The sequence number is 11, and using forward acknowledgment field. PC2 replies with a sequence number of 51, a value of 12 in the acknowledgment field. Then the exchange continues, like this. So, what should you remember from this? Remember that hosts set a random initial sequence used to indicate the sequence number of the Okay, so now I've shown how the sequence are used to acknowledge that the host has These sequence numbers also allow hosts to for some reason they arrive out of order. Now, what about this part? If a segment isn't acknowledged, it is sent I will briefly demonstrate. To simplify things, I will only show one set So, PC1 sends SRV1 a segment with sequence Using forward acknowledgment, SRV1 sends Ack PC1 then sends Sequence number 21, but for After waiting a certain amount of time with This is called TCP retransmission. This time SRV1 receives it, and sends Ack Okay, that's a very brief overview of how acknowledged. Finally, let me introduce how TCP provides Acknowledging every single segment, no matter However, the TCP header's window size field is required. Here's an example. A host could send three segments, with sequence sent with sequence number 23. In addition, a 'sliding window' is used size is. The window size is increased as much as possible size backs down to a more reasonable level, Okay, before moving on let me point out one In all of these examples, I used very simple In real situations, the sequence numbers get each message, especially when the sliding For the CCNA, just understand the concepts Okay, so that was a very brief overview of It would take hours to cover all of the details, the concepts. The details I did show you about sequence just to help you understand the basic concepts. Remember, the exam topics state that you need you need to understand the detailed mechanics Now that you've seen some of what TCP provides UDP is much simpler, so I'll sum it up in UDP is not connection-oriented. It is connectionless. Unlike TCP, in UDP the sending host does not host before sending data. It is simply sent. UDP does not provide reliable communication. When UDP is used, acknowledgments are not If a segment is lost, UDP has no mechanism Segments are sent 'best-effort'. You might not be familiar with the term best-effort. Basically, it means UDP provides no guarantee It sends it, it makes the effort, but it doesn't UDP does not provide sequencing. Unlike TCP, UDP has no sequence field in its If segments arrive out of order, UDP has no Finally, UDP does not provide flow control. It has no mechanism like TCP's window size Let's take a look at the UDP header. , thanks again to Wikipedia for the image. That's it. Four fields. Source and destination port numbers, a length and a checksum so the receiving host can check In the next slide let's compare TCP and First up, here are the two headers for comparison. All of the additional fields that TCP has like sequencing and error recovery. So, in which cases would TCP be used, and TCP provides more features than UDP, but at the larger header. In addition, acknowledgments and retransmissions For applications that require reliable communications, You wouldn't want to download a PDF file You want to make sure you get the whole file. On the other hand, for applications like real-time phone calls, Zoom, Skype, etc, UDP is preferred. These applications are very delay-sensitive, it down. One thing to note is that there are some applications such within the application itself. TFTP, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol, I'll cover it later in the course. Also, think about a Skype call. If you're talking to someone over Skype you can simply ask the other person to repeat In effect, you are asking for a 'retransmission'. Finally, there are some applications that DNS, the Domain Name System, is an example. Here's a chart summarizing the differences But don't forget, both TCP and UDP provide These port numbers identify Application Layer They are both Layer 4 protocols, so they both Finally, I will list some important well-known We haven't really covered any of these Application taking the time to memorize the port numbers I will provide flashcards in the flashcard I will, however, mention the port numbers the course, so if you prefer you can learn Here's the list. First up, FTP, the File Transfer Protocol, SSH, Secure Shell, which is commonly used uses TCP port 22. Telnet, which can also be used to connect SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, is HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, commonly 80. POP3, Post Office Protocol 3, used for retrieving And finally HTTPS, Hypertext Transfer Protocol Okay, let's list some protocols that use DHCP, Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, IP address and other things, uses UDP ports TFTP, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol, SNMP, the Simple Network Management Protocol, Syslog uses UDP port 514. Finally, the only protocol you should be aware Name System. It usually uses UDP, but uses TCP in some Okay, to help you review I have added a 'portnumbers' numbers. Here's how you can use it to review these Open the Anki flashcard deck. Click on 'custom study'. You'll see this window. Select 'study by card state or tag'. Then select 'all cards in random order (don't Finally click on 'choose tags'. This window will pop up. Check 'require one or more of these tags' highlighted. Also make sure it isn't highlighted under Finally, click OK. Now you will be able to review the cards without After you have reviewed them, you can simply to review them once more. Do it until you answer them all perfectly. By the way, if you have questions about Anki are having trouble getting the custom study or look on the Anki website. I'm no Anki expert and it's hard for me section. Before moving on to the quiz, let's review We covered the basics of Layer 4, including We took a look at TCP, a Layer 4 protocol such as reliable communication and flow control. Then we looked at UDP, which doesn't provide a smaller header with less overhead. Finally, we spent some time comparing the Remember the exam topics list, you're expected so focus on that. Watch until the end of the quiz for a bonus exams for the CCNA. Okay, let's go to quiz question 1. Which of the following is a well-known port A, 1010. B, 2001. C, 4023. Or D, 65000. Pause the video to think about your answer. The answer is A, 1010. Here are the ranges designated by IANA. Well-known port numbers are those from 0 through Answers B and C are in the Registered range, Okay, let's move on to question 2. According to IANA specifications, what range randomly selecting a source Layer 4 port number? A, well-known. B, registered. C, ephemeral. Or D, reserved. Pause the video to think about your answer. The answer is C, ephemeral. The destination port number depends on the port number should be randomly selected from Once again, here are the different port ranges Note that D, reserved, isn't one of the Okay, let's go to question 3. Which of the following are features of TCP (select three). A, Layer 4 addressing. B, error recovery. C, session multiplexing. D, flow control. And E, sequencing. Pause the video to think about your answers, The answers are B, error recovery, D, flow Layer 4 addressing in the form of port numbers TCP and UDP, but only TCP provides services to applications. Okay, let's go to question 4. Which of the following Application Layer protocols (select three). A, SMTP. B, SNMP. C, HTTPS. D, DHCP. E, Syslog. Or F, SSH. Pause the video to think about your answers, The answers are A, SMTP, C, HTTPS, and F, Although we haven't learned the details which ones use TCP or UDP, and their port You'll definitely need to know some of them Okay, let's move on to question 5. PC1 and SRV1 have an active TCP connection. SRV1 receives a TCP segment from PC1 with When SRV1 acknowledges the segment, what will TCP header be? Assume a TCP window size of 1. A, 26. B, 27. Or C, 28. Pause the video to think about your answer. The answer is C. TCP uses 'forward acknowledgment', segment by stating the next segment it expects If SRV1 acknowledged with a value of 27, for receive the segment with sequence number 27, Don't worry too much about the details of understanding of how sequencing and acknowledgment Okay, that's all for the quiz. Let's take a look at a bonus question in Here's today's Boson ExSim practice question. So, I will click on Launch Simulator and here Select the applications layer protocols on transport layer protocols. All application layer protocols will be used. So, these here on the left are all application layer protocols we just learned, TCP and UDP. And also one of these uses both TCP and UDP. Okay, so pause the video here and think about Okay, let's check. So I will go from top to bottom. DNS, Domain Name System, that uses TCP and Usually it uses UDP, but it does use TCP in Next, DHCP uses UDP. FTP, File Transfer Protocol, TCP. HTTP uses TCP. SMTP, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, TCP. And then these last two, of course UDP. SNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol. And TFTP, the Trivial File Transfer Protocol. Okay, so I will click on 'done'. And let's see if I'm correct. Click on 'show answer'. And yes, that is correct. So, if you want to read Boson's explanation I haven't explained all of these application later in the course. For now just remember whether they use TCP Okay, so that's Boson ExSim for CCNA. I highly recommend these practice exams. I used them when I was studying for my CCNA because they really helped me pass my exams. So, if you want to get a copy of Boson ExSim, There are supplementary materials for this There is a flashcard deck to use with the This time there won't be a packet tracer demo, to show you TCP and UDP in action in Wireshark is a packet capture program, which It's great for studying and also a very Before finishing today's video I want to To join, please click the 'Join' button Thank you to Benjamin, Deepak, Tshepiso, Justin, Erlison, Apogee, Wasseem, Marko, Florian, Value, John, Funnydart, Scott, Hassan, Gerrard, Mark, Yousif, Sidi, Boson Software, Charlesetta, Sorry if I pronounced your name incorrectly, One of you is still displaying as Channel me know and I'll see if YouTube can fix This is the list of JCNP-level members at 28th 2020, if you signed up recently and your be in future videos.
