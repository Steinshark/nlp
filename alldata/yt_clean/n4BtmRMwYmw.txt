The news that caliph Uthman was assassinated reached him in 656 and he returned to Syria Muawiyah was one of the participants in the civil war within the Caliphate and after Caliph Ali was assassinated in 661 He became the next ruler and established the Umayyad dynasty All that gave the Byzantines some respite and they even took roads back However, Muawiyah still dreamt of taking Constantinople. In 673 the Muslim Navy attacked in three directions Tarsus, Smyrna and Rhodes were conquered and the latter two became permanent basis for future invasions In 674 the Arabs took Suzukas, just one hundred kilometers away from Constantinople The events between 674 and 678 are shrouded in mystery with some sources claiming that the capital of the Empire was under a constant siege While others insist that it was just a series of raids But we know that the Byzantines used Greek fire for the first time to destroy the Arab fleet In 678 the Byzantines managed to land a small force in Syria and that sparked a revolt by the local Christians That forced the caliphates to sign a peace treaty and pay a symbolic amount in reparations in 679 Meanwhile a war in the Caspian steppes was raging between the Bulgars and the Kazars and the former had to migrate The Bulgars were led by Asparukh Khan, they settled around the Danube River sometime between 674 and 678 But now that the eastern border was secured, Emperor Constantine IV Assembled a strong force and marched to meet these new invaders The Bulgars took a defensive position in a place called Ongarl in the Danube Delta and a siege began After three days the Emperor boarded a ship and left his army most probably to attend the 6th Ecumenical council in his Capital Seeing that some of the troops decided to abandon the siege Asparukh used this opportunity and charged out against the Byzantine forces who began to rout. The Bulgar horsemen rode them down all the way to Athesos modern day Varna The Byzantine losses were heavy and the following year they signed a peace treaty Which guaranteed the borders of Bulgaria and agreed to pay yearly tribute to the nomads who were here to stay. Constantine was succeeded by Justinian II in 685 Justinian was very ambitious and wanted to live up to his name in 687 he led successful campaigns against the Bulgars and the Slavs He signed a new treaty with the Caliphate according to which Armenia, Cabiria and Cyprus were now in joint possession However in 692 he attacked the Muslims again, and who were soundly defeated at Sebastopolis as in Silesia In 695 Justinian was deposed and a period known as the twenty years of anarchy began Six Emperor's ruled during this period and the Caliphate used this time to take over North Africa and Spain The Arabs were making inroads into Anatolia, and it was clear that Constantinople would be next Emperor Theodosius III was aware of this danger and in 716 signed an alliance with the Bulgarian.. ...Khan Tervel and prepared to defend his capital Stockpiling food and ordering any family who couldn't acquire enough food to last for three years to evacuate the city In 717 the Arabian forces were besieging the city of Amorian At the same time the Strategos of the Anatolian theme Leo rebelled against the Emperor the Muslims tried to take advantage of the situation... ...and Negotiated with them.
