(intense music) - [Narrator] The ground proximity - We're sinking, we're going down guys. All right, all right. - [Narrator] August 7th, 1997. Fine Air cargo flight 101 prepares to take off from Miami At 12:30 p.m. when flight first officer Petroski - Standard flying procedure. If there's a problem prior the pilot in command Treat anything after V1 - Sounds good. - [Narrator] At 12:34, - Fine Air 101, fly heading - Takeoff 27 right, Fine Air 101 heavy. - [Pilot] Okay four spooled and stable. Knots power. Okay, coming up on 60 knots, power set. 80. V1 rotate. - [Narrator] The plane - Hey easy, easy, easy, easy, easy. - Gear up. - [Narrator] The air traffic by what he now sees. - What's going on? - Whoa, whoa. - [Narrator] The crew tries to - [Computer] Too low, gear. Too low. Too low, terrain. - Stop. - [Computer] Too low, terrain. Pull up. (dramatic music) - [Dispatcher] Where is your emergency? - [Caller] Yes there's been a plane crash at 72nd and 25th. - [Narrator] It's the unthinkable, a plane crash in the heart of Miami. The plane's three man are confirmed dead. Before the crash, XL Airways flight 888, the captain tries to fly out of trouble. He increases power while to bring the nose down. It's a textbook maneuver but it doesn't work. The plane continues to and falls from the sky. Investigators need to know why. The flight plan calls for flying the plane through a series of 35 inflight tests that make up what's known - [Controller] Okay - [Narrator] A computer analyze flight 888's final flight check. - Here we go. - [Narrator] Captain Keppel deliberately slows his but the computer lets Below the minimum needed to Investigators notice a warning moments before the crash. - [Investigator] There, what is that? - [Narrator] They learn that the warning is supposed to alert the pilots the flight computer is no It is switched to full manual mode. The warning comes on gets conflicting information. The frozen sensors are the plane is flying level. While other onboard sensors are relaying its extreme nose up attitude. One must be wrong. - The plane gave the - [Narrator] It seems either didn't see or didn't understand the warning being sent by the computer. - Stick forward. - [Narrator] The pilot uses his side stick to try to lower the nose. - [Pilot] Stick forward. - [Narrator] In manual mode, The crew also needs to for a more dramatic change Investigators need to know failed to act quickly when They suspect one reason may be the unusual nature of this flight. An acceptance flight designed - [Pilot] Okay that's good. During the turn, let's - Okay. - [Narrator] Every time - [Pilot] Hands off now. - [Narrator] The automation - Yeah, yes, voila it's all good. - [Narrator] Even when they - [Controller] We need to over speed. - You just want to hear - [Narrator] They're expecting the plane to correct the problem. - There it is, you can cancel - They trusted the plane too much. - Stick forward. - Flaps up, flaps up. - [Narrator] With their plane the seven men aboard - Oh god, oh god. - Damn it. (plane whooshing) - [Narrator] The official accident report highlights several contributing factors, including the decision at low altitude. - Yeah we need to go slow with recovery. - [Narrator] The report governing acceptance flight and more training for stall recovery. It's Easter Monday, 1994 at - Set torque. Fly controls. - [Narrator] KLM Cityhopper flight 433 is on its way from - What's that ahead of - Oh yeah. - [Narrator] Captain Levard He wants to get above them. - Ask control flight level 200. - Amsterdam KLM 433. - [Controller] Go ahead 433. - Is flight level 200 available? - Climb to 200, you are - [Narrator] Amsterdam air traffic control okays the climb to 20,000 feet. - Okay we're not climbing anymore. - [Narrator] Approaching 17,000 feet, Captain Levard notices a problem with his plane's performance. - No. - [Narrator] It's not climbing - We need to return to request to maintain flight level 160. Tell them we have a technical issue. - Amsterdam KLM 433, We have an engine problem for return to Schiphol. - That's a copy, sir. You may turn right heading to Schiphol. - [Narrator] The pan calls sends - We have a pan from KLM 433 (sirens blaring) - [Narrator] At the race to positions near the runway. KLM 433 is just 500 feet above the ground. - Watch your speed. - [Narrator] The plane has slowed to a dangerously low speed. - I'm on it. (passengers gasping) - [Narrator] A sudden bank to the right takes the passengers by surprise. The captain struggles - Going around, set - [Narrator] Then he tries (passengers yelling) - [Narrator] Flight 433 - Steer steer steer garret garret garret. - Crash crash crash, runway - [Narrator] KLM in full view of Amsterdam Bagram air field in It's a hive of activity. - Bagram ground, icef, 95 - [Narrator] The crew of is on the last leg of a grueling shift. The flight plan has taken to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan where the crew loaded up There were supposed to but were rerouted via Bagram. Finally at 3:25 p.m. - 95 Alpha Quebec runway - Runway three is verified. - Prepare for departure. - [Narrator] The first for this final leg. They're scheduled to arrive in Dubai in two and a half hours. At that same moment, military is on the basis perimeter road, returning from a day's work taking photographs for a magazine. - We decided we were going And I saw off to the left of the truck, a white and purple 747 this is beautiful a airplane, - V1, rotate. - Gear up. - Gear up. - [Controller] He pulled away And in this case there was - [Narrator] The climb is unusually steep. - What's going on with that aircraft? - It was almost stuttering in the air. - Keep on that. Get the nose down. - [Narrator] The plane is The nose won't drop. - My airplane. - [Narrator] In a matter of seconds, the crew is in emergency mode. If they can't get the nose down For a moment, the plane - And then the aircraft seemed to sort of careen in our direction. Now you're looking at a - Stop the car. - And then it completely and I remember thinking, And in a very slow motion, and pancaked into the ground. The explosion was enormous. - [Narrator] Did flight because it was too heavy? - [Translator] During our that West Caribbean didn't over the checking of passengers' - [Narrator] If a plane is too heavy, it may not be able to where the air is less dense. Pilots need to make these (speaking in foreign language) - [Translator] The pilot knows by studying the aircraft's and inputting the plane's - [Narrator] What investigators don't know is whether Captain Ospina - Standby. - [Narrator] They now try to was too heavy to avoid - So we went back and looked at the number of passengers on board, the number of crew on board and the weight of the aircraft itself along with the baggage. - [Narrator] They already tested the plane at it's reported weight of 148,000 pounds. - All right, let's add We've got heavier luggage, misweighed cargo. - Let's try 155,000 pounds. - [Narrator] Investigators for a plane that's grossly overweight. They're in for a surprise. - And even with a heavier the aircraft could maintain - [Narrator] It's a setback - We're missing something. - Let's go back to the beginning. - [Narrator] After much research, investigators still can't figure out what caused the plane to stall. - Thanks. - [Narrator] The answer has to do with how a plane distributes power. When it's turned on, the anti icing system draws energy from the engines - This decrease in thrust can affect the performance of the airplane depending on the weight and the altitude. So the performance study showed that the airplane was perfectly with the anti ice on. - Anti ice on please. - [Joseph] However, it could only fly as high as 31,900 feet with the anti ice on. - It was the anti icing. - Robbed them of the power they needed. - They shouldn't have (speaking in Spanish) - [Translator] We was flown too high for its weight and the weather conditions it faced. - [Narrator] The investigators learned that neither pilot had ever They wonder if the captain knew that runway 10 was a than runway two eight. They studied the airline's procedures. - They had to watch a video. That's it. - [Narrator] Because of the military pilots require special training to land on runway 10, but the cargo airline only to watch a short video. - [Video Narrator] when landing on runway one zero. - [Narrator] Records show had both watched the training - [Video Narrator] Align your base leg just to the right of the strobe beacon. This beacon identifies beginning at the shoreline. (plane whooshing) - [Narrator] To avoid The plane must make a tight right turn. - Where's the strobe? - Right over there. - Where? - Right over there. - [Narrator] The captain that marks the Cuban border. - You know we're not getting - [Narrator] The flight engineer notices that the plane is still flying - Where's the strobe? - Right down there. - I still don't see it. - [Narrator] Instead of the captain keeps trying Flight engineer Richmond sees the DC-8 isn't properly - Do you think you're going to make this? - Yeah. If I can catch the strobe light. - [Narrator] First officer but captain Chapo isn't taking the hint. The DC-8 begins its critical final turn. (airplane engine roaring) The team needs to know why the crew didn't abandon an approach that was clearly going wrong. AirAsia flight 8501 cruises North of Indonesia. The pilot in command is 53 He's highly experienced with more than 20,000 hours in the air. His first officer is French He is 46 with about 2,000 flight hours, much of it on the Airbus. 22 minutes into the flight, the pilots notice bad The captain decides to increase altitude to go above the storm - I'm going to radio for a higher cruise, get around the weather. - Good idea. - [Narrator] But before the captain can contact air traffic control, he gets a fault warning - E-cam actions. - [Narrator] The plane's give the pilots step-by-step instructions on how to fix the issue. The pilots now notice that the plane is rolling sharply left. - Level. Okay level. - [Narrator] Something with flight 8501. The first officer is struggling. - Level. - [Narrator] But soon, the - Level. - [Narrator] The pilots - It's not responding. - [Pilot] Pull down. - [First Pilot] It's not correcting. - [Narrator] The plane seems to have taken on a life of its own. It climbs higher and higher as the pilots fight to level off. Then inexplicably, the - Altitude. - I see it. - [Narrator] Flight 8501 Speeding toward the ocean below. It seems the pilots can do - Pull. - It's not correcting, what's going on? Max power. (passengers screaming) - [Narrator] 43 minutes into what should have been Airasia flight 8501 disappears from radar. - Pull-- - Pull. - [Narrator] Of the 162 there are no survivors. After being delayed for more than an hour, Spanair flight 5022 is There are 166 passengers on board. Many of them looking to escape the stifling heat of Madrid in August. - [Translator] Everyone Everyone wanted to be on their way. - [Narrator] Anna Stefanides She is on her way to the Canary islands to meet some friends. - [Translator] Most of different summer holidays in August. I was going to Grand Canary We were going to have one - Spanair 5022, you're next - Okay here we go. - [Narrator] At 2:23, the MD-82 aircraft starts speeding down the runway. - 100. - [Narrator] The captain They can't lift off until takeoff speed. - V1, rotate. (alarm beeping) - [Narrator] An alarm warns the pilots something is going wrong. - Engine failure? - [Narrator] The first but he's losing control of the plane. - How the hell do you - [Narrator] The plane is less - [Translator] I managed to I've had a good life. I thought, now I die. - Fly the plane. Fly it. - Oh god. - [Narrator] Just seconds after takeoff, flight 5022 slams into a The plane with 172 people on board is now shattered wreckage Captain Kevin Stables Emery Worldwide flight 17. His first officer is George Land. They're hauling freight across the country aboard a 30 year old DC-8 cargo plane. - Hi there, is that the load plan? - Just before they're finished up loading the last couple of containers they would give us a list of and how much it weighed, in what position on the airplane it was. - Here you go boss. - Then we'd take that information and we would calculate the and make sure that it was all correct. - Airspeed's alive. - Alive, here. - 80 knots. - 80 knots. Elevator checks. - [Narrator] Just another routine takeoff. - V1 rotate. - [Narrator] But as the nose the DC-8 pitches upward much - Watch the tail. - They recognize that they have an issue during the course of the airplane actually starting to rotate - V2, positive rate. - [Narrator] The sudden by an uncommanded left bank. - I got it. - You got it? - [Narrator] This is anything but routine. - We're going back. - What the hell? - The center of gravity - [Narrator] They need as quickly as possible. - [Pilot] Emery 17 emergency. - Emery 17 say again? - When a pilot declares an emergency, that really cues an air that this isn't just This is a critical situation. - [Narrator] The ground proximity - We're sinking, we're going down guys. - All right all right. - Okay we're going back up. - [Narrator] The DC-8 - Roll out, roll out. - [Narrator] But the pilots are still struggling for control. - Emery 17 extreme balance problem. - Emery 17, roger. - The airplane started to go into these big perturbations, dive and - [Narrator] They push all the way forward in a desperate effort to level the plane. - Power. - More? - [Narrator] Captain Stables and his crew have managed to get their crippled plane to inside of the runway. - It was working very well. I made it almost all the way around to the backside of the airport. - [Narrator] They knew if they there was going to be crash fire rescue that would have been - [Narrator] They've now - We're still trying to look ahead to figure out what needs to be done next. But they know that sooner or later, they got to get on the ground. (soft soothing music)
