Cocco Co., Ltd. is a comprehensive recycling company located in Hiroshima Prefecture, Japan. In Japan, approximately 1 million tons of glass bottles are produced annually, but some colored glass bottles cannot be recycled and are disposed of in landfills. Cocco Co., Ltd. focuses on recycling waste glass bottles used for beverages and food, producing a lightweight foamed material called Super Sol. Super Sol is a lightweight foamed material made by crushing, firing, and foaming waste glass bottles, often referred to as artificial pumice. Today, we will show you the process of making Super Sol. Let's take a look together. Super Sol is created by crushing, firing, and foaming waste glass bottles. Super Sol is used in various fields, including civil engineering, landscaping, agriculture, and household applications. Collection of waste glass bottles. Before crushing, the raw materials are fully dried using waste heat from the kiln. The dried raw materials are placed into a hopper for distribution as needed. Impurities like plastic caps, which result from crushing, are removed before starting the crusher. Crusher start-up. The crushed waste glass bottles are further ground to about 200 microns using ceramic balls. Impurities like labels attached to the glass are removed. Recycling of waste solar panels. The glass from waste solar panels is also used as a raw material for Super Sol. Aluminum frames removed from solar panels are recycled as aluminum material. Small steel balls are blasted to remove the glass on the surface of waste solar panels. The glass-removed waste solar panels are sent to a smelter to extract and recycle silver. The crushed waste glass bottles are sieved to about 200 microns. Additives are mixed with the glass powder. The mixed powder is placed on the firing line. The mixed powder is fired at about 800degC to 900degC and foamed. It is mainly used as civil engineering material. Super Sol can also be used as security gravel.
