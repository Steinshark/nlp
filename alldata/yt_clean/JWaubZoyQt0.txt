Hello everyone I came to the balcony garden to harvest basil for lunch. Harvesting two large basil leaves Today's lunch menu is marinated cherry tomatoes. Finely chop the onion. Roll up the basil leaves and chop them finely. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Put everything in a glass bowl. Add 4 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1 tbsp lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Mix everything well, and the tomato marinade is done I'm going to cook cappellini pasta for the dish. Add a pinch of salt and cook the pasta for 7 minutes. Rinse it lightly and put it in a bowl. Add the cherry tomato marinade generously. Add cute mini cheese. Top with basil leaves, and it's done A friend recommended this Esavisa soda, so I bought it. It didn't have a strange smell, and it tastes good?? Approved.. Roll up the pasta and take a bite. It's a refreshing salad pasta taste that makes me feel good. It's the perfect flavor for a weekend brunch But the problem is, today is not the weekend. The combination of marinated cherry tomatoes and mozzarella cheese was the best Before the afternoon class, I'm getting some caffeine. Add a lot of milk. I've been cutting down on coffee lately, so I'll add a light shot. Add some mint syrup to make a mint latte. Mint lattes with a shot aren't sold outside much, so I make them at home like this. For dinner today, I'm making Dongpayeok (braised pork belly). Cut the pork shoulder into large pieces. Put some oil in the pot and brown the pork on all sides. Once the surface is cooked, add water to cover the pork. Add 1 cup soy sauce, 1 cup cooking wine, 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1/2 cup brown sugar. Add whole garlic, whole pepper, and bay leaves. It's said that adding a bottle of Ssanghwa-tang makes it really delicious! Let it simmer for more than 30 minutes. The visual is amazing... Cut it into bite-sized pieces. Arrange it nicely in the center of the bowl. I've been growing bok choy, but it's still in mini size. I'm going to harvest some small napa cabbage that looks similar Blanch it for about 30 seconds in boiling water. Place it around the Dongpayeok. Pour the Dongpayeok broth over the top, and it's done~ I'll heat some multigrain rice and eat it with the dish. Enjoy! The taste really makes you want rice It's not melting in your mouth, but it's chewy, and the sauce is so delicious. The marinated cherry tomatoes are refreshing and can be eaten like a side dish. I really wanted to eat Dongpayeok, and it tastes amazing.. The texture of the napa cabbage was as good as bok choy I ate dinner quickly and am going to try making Haribo jelly, which is trending these days. But... has the trend already ended? Soak it in sparkling water for over 12 hours instead of soda. 'Yass' is doing photosynthesis She's been running on the cat wheel a lot lately, but it doesn't look like she's losing weight... Today's lunch is a quick tofu gratin. Break the tofu into pieces with a spoon. Add a lot of tomato sauce Spread it evenly. Add frozen corn. Cut some sliced ham and add it. Cut the onion roughly with scissors. Add a lot of mozzarella cheese. Microwave it until the cheese melts. Sprinkle parsley, and it's done Eat lunch quickly and try making Gyeongseong Jwack! I saw how to make it when it was trending, but it seemed complicated, so I gave up. A subscriber recently commented asking me to make it, so here I am The tofu is so soft, and it's easy to slurp down. It's good for using up leftover ingredients and it's simple and delicious It tastes light, so I liked it even more :D The lovely 'Mary'! She's cleaning the floor for me. Let's take a good look at those cute paws. A suspicious back view. Rescuing the mouse. After soaking Haribo jelly for about 12 hours! Freeze it for about 6 hours in the freezer. Making the Gyeongseong Jwack syrup first ('Seodam' recipe!) 300g corn syrup, 100g water, 1 tbsp ginger juice (or ginger powder) Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once white foam rises, reduce heat and let it simmer. When the syrup thickens, turn off the heat. Bought glutinous rice flour for making Gyeongseong Jwack. 200g glutinous rice flour, 50g wheat flour. Sift it finely through a strainer. Add 50g sugar, 1 tsp salt. I also bought makgeolli for making Gyeongseong Jwack. 50g makgeolli. Add hot water gradually to adjust the consistency. Adjust the consistency to a clay-like texture. Cover with a cloth and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Divide into portions and roll them into balls. Rolling... It looks like the mozzarella cheese I had yesterday. Before the dough dries out, make a hole in the center. The hole should be big to fry it crispy all the way through! Place them one by one in oil to prevent sticking. Fry slowly over low heat (I had the heat too high) Once crispy, remove and drain excess oil. Dip in syrup. After soaking in syrup for about an hour, the Gyeongseong Jwack is done! For dinner, my friend is coming over to try out chicken nuggets from Bulyongari! Cook at 180degC for 10 minutes. Add a little water to a pot and cook the kielbasa sausages first. Add the thick noodles. Add enough cream to cover the ingredients. Add spicy Buldak sauce Cut some sliced ham into long pieces and add. Let it simmer. The kielbasa sausage has cheese inside Serve the thickened sausage-rosemary Tteokbokki. Finish with parsley Add the baked wings and close. The friend who recommended the soda is right! Taking the taste of a very raw apple and try it. First bite of Bulgogi! The chili seeds are coated on the outside like a crispy batter, super crunchy and delicious The noodles are so chewy, and the spicy Buldak rose sauce goes perfectly with them The rose sauce, made with cream and Buldak sauce, is the best combination! The Kielbasa sausage was good because it had cheese inside, but the skin was too tough. It's been a while since I had Buldak rose tteokbokki... it's absolutely the best I took a quick break and made 'Mary' and 'Yass' a little hideout with a paper bag. Do you like it, master? Choosing a hiding spot is quite a picky process. Cat trait: If you make a hideout for them, they won't use it. For dessert, I'll try the bread my friend bought from E-Mart. The texture is tougher than expected. It's just okay... not what I expected. In that case, I'll try the frozen jelly. The texture and the sound are so satisfying The taste is... bland! It tastes like plain water without the sweetness. Here comes my homemade Gyeongseong Jooak! Let's eat~ It's crispy on the outside and chewy like rice cake inside. It doesn't seem like I fried it well, but it still tastes good. It's not a perfect Gyeongseong Jooak, but I'm a little disappointed I think I used too much heat while frying. I'll try again during the next holiday. Still, it looked great for my first Gyeongseong Jooak Let's finish today's video with the cute 'Yass' Woke up to 'Mary's' morning call Mary: Wake up, human. Today, I'm going to pick some perilla leaves and eat them. Today's lunch menu is smoked duck bulgogi. I'm prepping the vegetables I had at home. I'll add cabbage, enoki mushrooms, and smoked duck to the pot. 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp gochujang, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp allulose, 1 tbsp chili powder. Stir-fry it sweetly. Once the vegetables are cooked, I'll add green onions and stir-fry for another minute. I'm also using up the perilla leaves that are wilting in the fridge. I'll chop them roughly and throw them in. Top it with the completed smoked duck bulgogi. Sprinkle some sesame seeds to finish. Place some spicy smoked duck bulgogi on top of perilla leaves and take a bite. It's really delicious Making bulgogi with smoked duck gives it a slightly less greasy taste. It's even better than regular duck bulgogi I've been growing vegetables at home with hydroponics, and some of you were curious about the method. I filmed a detailed video this week, so it should be up in about two weeks! I cooked a delicious meal with the leftover ingredients for lunch :D For dinner, I'm having frozen chicken nuggets and Tsuyu noodles! I tasted these chicken nuggets at Costco, fell in love with them, and bought them. They're so delicious. TMI: I dropped the lid of this bowl and it broke haha. I'll boil somen noodles in hot water. Rinse them in cold water and place them in a bowl. Add Tsuyu sauce and water in a 1:0.8 ratio. Time for the bear to dive in Let the noodles soak in the Tsuyu sauce and slurp them up. This Tsuyu noodle dish became famous with Choi Hwajung in the summer, and I'm trying it for the first time! What is this? It's totally my style... It's easy to make, and the slurpiness makes it perfect for a late-night snack. I think it would be even better with a little lemon juice added to the sauce I wasn't that hungry, so I only boiled a little bit of noodles, but I slightly regret it. Boyfriend picture 'Yass' Good morning today! For lunch, I'll make chicken soup with the chicken I bought last time. I'll blanch the chicken and wash it clean. Add 2 tbsp cooking wine, 1 tbsp chicken stock and boil it well. I'll clean off some potatoes I had at home and add them to the chicken soup. Chop them finely. Chop the radish as well. Let the chicken cook for about 20 minutes. Take everything out. Add more water to the broth, add the potatoes and radish, and cook well. Hot... Shred the chicken and add it back into the soup. Add green onions generously and continue boiling to finish the chicken soup I'm here to harvest some young napa cabbage from the balcony garden I'll harvest 2 heads and make kimchi. Add anchovy sauce, allulose, vinegar, and chili powder to taste. Mix it all up. If you mix it well, you've got simple and delicious napa cabbage kimchi I'll pour the completed chicken soup into a bowl generously. Top with salt and pepper to finish. Take a sip of the hot broth first. It's a bit bland.... The flavor of the broth is so rich that you can't help but eat it with rice. It feels healthy because of the color of the rice +18714 points. It's really delicious when eaten with the kimchi The rich, warm broth is perfect for the chilly weather these days. When I can't focus on studying, I'll play with 'Mary'. A wild party. For dinner, I suddenly wanted to eat pickled cucumbers, so I made them. Cut the cucumber into bite-sized pieces. Add 1 tbsp ssamjang, 1 tbsp sesame oil, 1 tbsp chili powder, and sesame seeds. Mix it well and you've got simple, delicious pickled cucumbers~ I'll add the chicken soup I made earlier into the pot. Add some water and put in the kalguksu noodles to cook. Add 2 dumplings. And now you've got ultra-simple chicken kalguksu Finish it off with some spicy Buldak cold noodles sauce This cold noodle sauce is really spicy, so it's not great on its own. But adding just a little makes it perfectly spicy! The pickled cucumbers are crispy and refreshing, so tasty hh But wait... why are these cucumbers spicy...? Spicy kalguksu with spicy side dishes... I actually like it. Yass: Are you watching, human? You better look, I'm using the cat wheel for you, picky master. Yass: Look properly. Today's lunch is Yonggari fried noodles. I'm going to eat it with Yonggari chicken tenders. Spray some oil. Cook at 180degC for 10 minutes. This noodle packaging and cooking method are almost the same as Buldak noodles. The packaging says to drain the water and stir-fry, but I just cooked it in the sauce like Buldak. The visual is almost identical to Buldak noodles! I also crisped up the chicken tenders and put them in a bowl. Drizzle some honey mustard sauce. Let's eat! I'm curious about this new noodle flavor It's a little less spicy than Buldak noodles for me! Bulgogi is still totally my style It's like adding one spoonful of spicy jjampong to Buldak noodles. It's a sweet, mild, delicious fried noodle taste. I heard they added hot chili peppers, but it wasn't that spicy for me. Please re-release my beloved super spicy Buldak noodles... I had a simple, satisfying Bulgogi lunch. I bought the necessary ingredients through quick delivery I bought octopus and udon noodles for tonight's dinner. I bought some pork ribs and sweet potatoes on sale The sweet potatoes come in three different types of flavors. Honey sweet potatoes? I suddenly craved some fresh kimchi, so I ordered some!!! I moved it into a kimchi container. The visual of the fresh kimchi... it makes my mouth water For dinner, a close friend came over, and we made stir-fried octopus! Crack 5 eggs Add egg steam powder and water, shake, shake. Strain it through a fine sieve. Cover it and microwave for 6 minutes! Slice half an onion thinly. Tear the enoki mushrooms into small pieces. Heat oil in a pot and add the onions. Add 1 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp gochujang, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 2 tbsp allulose, and chili powder. Mix the sauce well and add the thawed octopus, stir-fry it. The octopus is especially plump today Once the octopus is cooked, add the udon noodles. For spiciness, I'll use Buldak sauce Last time, I used kalguksu noodles, but this time I'm going for udon! Once the stir-fried octopus udon is done, I'll serve it in a bowl. I added starch water, and the sauce got super thick. Let's eat~ I love how much sauce there is, it's totally my style. But my friend said the sauce was too thick last time and prefers it less saucy. I like it moist, so I think the udon version tastes better and is juicier Last time, I added the Tteokbokki sauce for spiciness, but this time, I think Buldak sauce fits better! I recommend Buldak sauce over Tteokbokki sauce I'm going to make walnut cookies for dessert! But now I'm making the dough with fish-shaped bread mix... I don't have any walnuts at home, so I'll skip them. Making walnut cookies without walnuts I used the leftover red bean paste from summer shaved ice! Put the red bean paste in, add the dough, and cook it. I tried, but the dough overflowed I'll use the Takoyaki method. The result... walnut-less walnut cookies with a Takoyaki twist. They tasted sweet and delicious like fish-shaped bread I'll wrap up this video with the cute 'Mary' :D That's it for today's video! Thank you so much for watching until the end
