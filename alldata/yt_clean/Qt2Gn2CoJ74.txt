&gt;&gt; This episode of the Modern Rogue brought to you by our Head on over to ring.com/home. Pick up the welcome kit, including the Video Doorbell and start building your own custom security solution for your home. &gt;&gt; All right, we're back &gt;&gt; Hey man. &gt;&gt; Good to see you again-- &gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, this has First, we learned all and about how essentially We learned that RFID chips because they're more like because there's back-and-forth. We learned about how they when it gets close to whatever these, oh, I did a thing. And we learned that you could to capture the number or-- &gt;&gt; One of those. and print out a new one of these, right? &gt;&gt; We can make a copy. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Here's where things get really scary. You guys were talking about The idea that out on the street-- &gt;&gt; Yeah, Dev shot a guy, took his card. [laughs] is somebody on the street or the badge on the side, you just walk past them &gt;&gt; Yep. So these readers, right? We talked about how they work when they're attached to a full system. But the reader doesn't If you take a car motor out of the car, it's still a motor. It's going to generate power if it's just on a work, test bench. You can take the reader off the wall. As long as it has power, it'll fart card data out the back end-- &gt;&gt; BRIAN: It's a very technical-- &gt;&gt; No matter what's connected to it. &gt;&gt; It's a very technical term. &gt;&gt; Do you guys ever where instead of a beep, when people-- &gt;&gt; New project for you, [laughs] That's a freebie. You don't even have to &gt;&gt; Is the disappointment [laughs] &gt;&gt; I don't know, I love this idea. &gt;&gt; You were describing-- &gt;&gt; A lot of our team meetings. Like, &quot;Babak, what if &quot;Can you make that happen?&quot; &gt;&gt; So, with these readers, it seems like you have &gt;&gt; BABAK: You do, yeah. &gt;&gt; Just to activate them. &gt;&gt; Would you be like rubbing &gt;&gt; If you used one of these But we have a different method, and we kind of use some of So, we've taken this. Now, this is a reader. You might have seen something when you go to, like, a parking garage-- &gt;&gt; Mm-hmm. &gt;&gt; Or an airport, or something. Anything with a gate arm. &gt;&gt; BABAK: And of course, you know, if you're in a car, or you're in a truck-- &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're doing &gt;&gt; You can't, like, take lean halfway out the window. You've got to have a little So, this is what, this As you can see, it's physically much larger than the standard reader, and that's because inside is a huge antenna. So, as you can see here, this entire green thing that's the antenna. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So that, along with a fancy circuitry is able to be much longer range. Now, with long range, we're you know, 10, 15 feet, but it's going to be much longer than this and we're going to show &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Yeah, okay, so what I recognize a battery. &gt;&gt; BABAK: Those aren't factory. &gt;&gt; You've added some stuff here. &gt;&gt; I have, yes, good eye. So, all of the original in this kind of L-shaped part Now we've added a couple We have some lithium-ion batteries, and then a boost converter to bring up that voltage to 12 volts that a little Arduino to record &gt;&gt; So this is the &gt;&gt; Yes. a self-contained unit. &gt;&gt; It saves it to an SD card and I got a little Bluetooth &gt;&gt; Nice. to see on my phone as soon &gt;&gt; Oh man, this is the &gt;&gt; It really is. &gt;&gt; This thing, as a mobile unit, you just walk around and you could just grab &gt;&gt; Yes-- discreet than that-- Yeah. &gt;&gt; I don't know, I do like being like, &quot;Ha ha, got your info,&quot; wearing a bandit mask. &gt;&gt; We've had a job once like, a nice company shirt and they said, &quot;Do you qualify for free coffee today?&quot; And it was like a whole, like, a booth, and they said, &quot;Here, try it.&quot; They were just touching people's badges, and it would occasionally say yes, and they'd give them a coupon that did nothing at the local businesses. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's dark. [laughs] Okay, I want to see what &gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's go ahead and close her back up. &gt;&gt; It looks like a scale. I thought it was a weighing &gt;&gt; DEVIANT: It's the new &gt;&gt; It has some rubber gaskets &gt;&gt; Oh, that's smart. So you don't have to &gt;&gt; BABAK: Yeah, and these So that's why they have that. &gt;&gt; JASON: Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, normally, there's We've added that just so all the cool stuff that it's going to do. &gt;&gt; What's happening when. &gt;&gt; So we're going to go And again, this is not all factory. We've added our own power switch and our own charging circuit so you can-- &gt;&gt; JASON: Gotcha. &gt;&gt; BABAK: Charge it whenever you like. &gt;&gt; Hold on, it just hit me. Is this a commercially available product? &gt;&gt; The reader itself is, but this whole thing But-- is a after-market build. &gt;&gt; It is-- &gt;&gt; Yes. if this started appearing &gt;&gt; We're going to go and it's going to take a few seconds. You hear that clicking? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah, so those were that are being used to tune the antenna. And now, it's set. So if you'd like, go &gt;&gt; Sure. bring it to the reader. &gt;&gt; All right, so I'm or I'm being in a subway, and I'm trying to figure out &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. It said got card. &gt;&gt; BABAK: It said got card. &gt;&gt; It says hunting wabbits? &gt;&gt; Jason, do you want to &gt;&gt; This is a normal laptop. &gt;&gt; Oh, you got to-- &gt;&gt; DEVIANT: It's an interesting principle you just illustrated there. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. &gt;&gt; Look at the angles. &gt;&gt; Those inductive antennas want to work in a field with each other. Them being parallel helps a lot more. &gt;&gt; Ah, so it matters that &gt;&gt; DEVIANT: Let's make &gt;&gt; All right, here we go. &gt;&gt; BABAK: We're going to &gt;&gt; BRIAN: Got it. &gt;&gt; BABAK: Put that in there. We'll do that. &gt;&gt; It's already beeping on there? It's, like, billion &gt;&gt; So if you're, like, in an elevator-- &gt;&gt; THat's what I was thinking. &gt;&gt; And, will it just start grabbing-- &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And of course, we're hearing that you would-- &gt;&gt; Not have a beep. So now, this is a normal bag, but inside of it is a cloner, right? I'm going to start monitoring And this way, even if the beep I can tell you when I have credentials. Just stand by, I'm going to connect to it. &gt;&gt; Hang on a second. Got to get my wallet. [laughs] &gt;&gt; Too little too late, brother. Too little too late. &gt;&gt; I just realized this is [laughs] Turns out it's all an elaborate ruse. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; We're getting onto &gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe we're at we're going to get coffee. I just kind of get next-- &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; And there's no way because it wouldn't make that beeping noise. &gt;&gt; That's correct. it's nothing to print as of now, because you're on your chip. How amazing is that? &gt;&gt; My Pikachu bandaid's coming off. &gt;&gt; It's a cute Pikachu. &gt;&gt; Thanks. All right, how do we protect against that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it keeps grabbing it. You've already got it, stop! Greedy damn robot. &gt;&gt; Actually, I didn't I just assume we're all screwed. Is there a way to protect against it? &gt;&gt; Yes, just like with anything related to technology and security, the the current limitations of old technology, and take a look at what they've done with the new platforms to mitigate. &gt;&gt; Those crazy wallets that Are those real? because there's not a true They would attenuate the Remember when the card &gt;&gt; They help a lot. &gt;&gt; It's going to be that, multiplied. So you'd have to really, it's We could make an more powerful antenna, and then you could make a better blocker. Honestly, that is the simplest But for companies that the idea of using modern credentials, modern credentials that so that readers won't that's good as long as that and then one day it will be, and then you do the next best thing. &gt;&gt; You know how, like, any or a new software that comes out, like when it first comes out, it's, like, secure, and then eventually, like, it gets hacked? Same thing with credentials. When new credentials come out, for like the first five or 10 years, however many years, they're good. And then someone finds a vulnerability, and then, like it's, the game continues. &gt;&gt; The ongoing arms race of security. &gt;&gt; The ongoing arms race &gt;&gt; For everybody at home about all of this stuff, &gt;&gt; redteamalliance.com. Happy to have you in the class, man. &gt;&gt; And you guys do live class, I'm beeping again. &gt;&gt; Stealing it, oh my god. I'm going to run away. I'm going to abscond with this. [laughs] &gt;&gt; BRIAN: I've got it! &gt;&gt; Get away from that guy! &gt;&gt; All right, John Rael. It has been over a year since I lured you away from Hollywood to become one of our producer editors here at The Modern Rogue. First thing I tasked you with was how to protect all of our equipment when none of us are here. I was convinced you had come up with some kind of highfalutin, with a utility belt and-- &gt;&gt; Mirrored glasses, yeah. But you came back with one word. &gt;&gt; Ring. &gt;&gt; And the more I asked, I was like, &quot;Yeah, yeah, yeah, &quot;but what about all the intelligent &quot;smart locks that I have?&quot; &gt;&gt; Ring works with them. &gt;&gt; And then I was like, &quot;Wait, &quot;what about the ability to scale, and--&quot; &gt;&gt; Just give me your smartphone, &gt;&gt; That's literally what it was. Now we're at the point where we have dozens and dozens all across the 7-acre shwood here at Modern Rogue World Headquarters. It is awesome, because when I know things are supposed to happen, I feel my pocket buzz. I'm able to open up. If I need to, I can talk to And if my pocket ever buzzes like at three in the morning when I know nobody's I'm able to open it right up and see, oh, don't worry about that, &gt;&gt; Taking a poop. &gt;&gt; Taking a poop-- There's a lot of poops. &gt;&gt; Well, that's the nice thing about Ring. You feel like you're always there. You feel like you can keep a and know that it's fine. It's just animal poop-- Yeah! I'll go back and I'll and I'll say, like, &quot;Well, &quot;I don't remember that being there,&quot; and I'll be able to see and all that stuff. I was like, &quot;Oh, it looks &quot;and he put this over here, &quot;and I bet this is, yep, It's that virtual presence And the amazing thing about We started with just three cameras, and now we got a bazillion-ty of them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, and if you want you can go to ring.com/home and you can get their welcome kit, which has, what? &gt;&gt; It's got the Video And the Chime Pro not only is a bing-bong to let you know when people are coming, but also it's a Wi-Fi extender, and it's an awesome the modular expansion of your You're going to feel like All you got to do is go to ring.com/home. Thank you, Ring. &gt;&gt; It said got card. &gt;&gt; That-- &gt;&gt; Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on. And it-- &gt;&gt; It says hunting wabbits on the screen. &gt;&gt; Which technology-- did you grab? &gt;&gt; It won't read that one. This is-- &gt;&gt; So it'll read this one. It'll read this one, these two here. &gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah. &gt;&gt; DEVIANT: All right, so.
