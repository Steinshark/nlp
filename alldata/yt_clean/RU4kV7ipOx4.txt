I should get going soon. How to prepare for tomorrow. Any idea who this mysterious new client None. I've been trying to get my agent Also tell me is that this client So it's a better class of client. Someone who doesn't call I'm hoping it's royalty. I mean, that would mean a whole new level dealing with heads of state It all sounds wonderful. I'm sensing a but. Well, maybe a little one. If you get this, I guess so. Similar, but less chaos, hopefully. When was the last time you went out I had an evening off and saw friends. Had time for a date. Gloria, you don't understand. If this client really is super high profile, the experience could help me Training. Top level pays to work for the real movers International CEOs. Royalty, presidents. That's quite a plan And in the meantime, this new job can't be Excuse me. Anyone? Wait. If you could just. Do you need help there? no, I'm actually. Yes. Missy. I just. I need to get these cakes I see. It's just that I've heard that the prince Really? I've heard that, too. It does sound frightful, doesn't he? I'm so sorry. I'm. Never mind that. Do you want me to clean? I feel you only make it worse. No, no, I have some I can. I've got some weights in here somewhere. I'm sure that. Just give me a second to. I assume you are a candidate for the position of personal assistant, Yes, I am. I'd offer to shake your hand, but. thank you. But no. You may restore yourself in there I mean, I'm not The role is quite unlike anything you've done before. I know, but I'm adaptable and discreet. No, I mean, your role is quite unlike You see, this is a different world, Lucy. There are rules and rituals to remember I'm here to learn. Good. For instance, leave the room before the prince does? No, but I do now. When he enters. It's just right, Your Highness. Right isn't quite the word I'd use. Don't mind me. I thought I would just sit in Very well, sir. If successful, your role will be to answer the prince's It's very dull. Right. Help him navigate New York's high society. Arrange the prince's schedule. It's very busy. I see, sir. And assist with the preparations to be held at the Queen's insistence He'll be hosting it here in New York. Well, that sounds exciting. The organization of the ball will serve as your probation period. If you can help us successfully stage We will confirm your position here in the royal household Running after me basically. I should stress, this is no ordinary bowl party. No, no. The masked ball is a royal reason ritual with three eligible debutantes the King and Queen of Pomerania You see, it is the bowl at The idea is that I will take the Pomeroy's betrothal The prince means Sound romantic, sir? Anything but duty and formality, and your duty will also entail helping for the interview with the three princess Interviewing princesses. Kind of questions would you ask? What's your favorite throne? Where do you buy your crown? Actually, I do have a question. What made you become a P.A., Ms.. Woods? Well, I. I like helping people. Making things right. Making things run smoothly because they don't You see, and so I had to organize everything. I had to look after her clean and iron, get myself to high school When I got back and doing it well made life easier and it made her happy. Is that true? Of course it's all true. I know the difference Well, Miss. Which will let you know Right. Thank you. Well, there's no need. We can tell her right away. I'm so sorry about the cakes. And if I said the wrong thing I hope you find the person you need. Sir, we have. Very well, sir. When can you start? Can you begin tomorrow? yes, sir. Remember, Mrs. Lucy, please. You might want to research by their crowns. So we might have found more suitable candidates. Have we seen anyone more suitable chaps. She's highly capable. She'll be a breath of fresh air This is going to be fun. Anyway, she'll only be here for a while when she. She might even last a few days Here's to you, kiddo. Your new job As long as I never see you made yourself memorable. That's what matters. Here's to fabulous royal events. Acute manners and glittering tiaras. I haven't seen any this. Now, that's what I call a showstopper. How fabulous. You've got to try that little beauty on. It's for the Prince's chosen one. It's stunning, though. Worth getting hits just for that, I'd say. Gloria. Rod, I'm a realist. A realist? The ring shouldn't come into it. You marry for love, Dear, sweet Lucy, Let me tell you, as one who has lived. You grab your chances where you can. Otherwise, you end up like me, wondering Gloria. it's fine. I'm over it. You don't sound over it. So what do we plan to run away together? There's not been a day that I haven't wondered Or what happened to Jimmy. I'm sorry, but that's the thing, darling. You never know Don't let your chances pass you by off. I have a feeling Any good? I have notes. Your knees shouldn't touch the floor. It should look as though But it shouldn't touch the floor. Okay. And your eyes should be straight ahead. In a word of caution. If I may somehow gain the impression how shall we say, warmth. Some might even call him charming. Do not be fooled, Lucy. No. Charm is his armor and shield. His method of escape. Should demands I wouldn't quite put it that way, but yes, it does have a similar effect. You may need to take a firm I'm afraid the other candidates all, and it's run rings around them, My advice is be prepared. That's my motto, too. Your Highness. So we were just taking a break Well, if Lucy needs a break, in my daily schedule. I don't actually need a break, sir, but if you'd like me to do that, I'm See you, James. Highly capable.

Best idea you've had all morning. We do have to finish the guest list No can wait. The masked ball is in a few short weeks. Let me have some fun, Lucy. Okay. What can I have running for you? We could go out to eat. What's a typical lunch menu? we could go to a cafe. That would be exciting. What's that? Which one? All of it. I usually just get brought dishes of food. I didn't know Well, here Okay. One turkey club combo on rivals. Two of those, please. I mean, one for me. Not too. That would be excessive, though. I probably could. No, just one kind of. You seriously never done this before? We've got that amusing here. No more amusing than being asked I'm sorry about that. I misjudged you. It's okay. I've heard worse. I heard of this one, Pierre, into the Hudson River we'll have to try that one when I get back home. With respect, if you did that to me, I don't do water. Don't do water. You can't just decide that. Yes, I can. I'm scared of it. So no scuba No, I can't swim. Well, I can order from a menu. We all have our weaknesses. I've always prided myself on working in my clients best interest, Well, mission accomplished. I'm feeling pretty stress free right now. That's because we're having lunch Hope I'm not talking out of turn, not entirely on board It's the schedule. Talking of which, Is that the phrase? I've seen it in the films. I only wanted to know I could help with this. hello, Henry Triana. Peace be with you. Hi, Ryan. Can you just call me I just need to make sure you're okay. And you've not just left Hello? No. No need for it. That's really very good. Well done. Thank you. I just wanted to. I was a bit curt with you at the cafe, and you're right. It was wrong of me and I just wanted to, you know. That's all right. I appreciate your honesty. And sometimes honesty is not always what we want to hear. What's that? Nothing. And if I had to be honest with you, rather dreading the most boring. Go. Do you want to answer that? No, it's fine. You see, it's my duty, and it's tradition. Something that I have to go through. But I don't know why It makes me want to run away and live No, Sir James. Actually, I keep Sir James. He can come. Not a lot of caves in New York. that's a shame. But I have to do something I don't like. I try to find that the least worst thing A novel idea. What would that be for you? The music. You could make a playlist for the quartet that might make it all Yes, that's great idea. I'll have a think about the playlist. The music. You really ought to answer that. Lucy, don't let me hold you up. I can't actually leave until you leave. of course. Yes. How silly of me. I'm going to have a lovely evening, whatever you do. Thank you. I don't think it'll be lovely for you. I won't be able to make movie night. What's happened? I don't know. I just find Amy. But she won't see what it is, You've stopped working for her. I couldn't just leave her in lurch. She could be in real trouble. What if it is an emergency. How quickly Nonsense. That would cost you a fortune. How else am I supposed to get there? Kind of like the control from harrowing. I won't hear another word. Get in. We need to get going for you. I can't thank you enough. Lucy. What are you doing here? You said to come. You said it was urgent. that. I lost my password to my lady's account. I thought you'd be the one to remember it. No drama. But then I found I'd written it down. Can you believe That's great. The thing is. Couldn't you have asked Patricia? Who? The part that replaced me. she was two opposite. Go. They come. They go. Anyway, thanks for stopping by. So sweet. Have a happy life. We've got a late reply from the house. And the hosts are still waiting He probably won't reply Lucy? Yes, That sounds wonderful. Well, Sir James? No, he's chosen to go to his boat. It's a little vexing, to be honest. I say a little vexing, timed, very inconvenient problem. Why do I always say that? The prince is delighted. He's delighted to hear this. Delighted to hear that. Always delighted. It's because the prince is always Lizzie, one of the secrets to this world is consistency, Consistency Even correspondence. If all let us say the same thing, then favorable response. Can they? Clever. Hello? Lucy speaking. Lucy. Your Highness? Yes. What do you want? You called me. I didn't know. I was just joking. It's nice to hear you so relaxed. There's nothing is good for And on that note, Lucy, I wondered, Me? Yes. I need my back. Some of the fellows from Newgate. That's another test. Stretching and caring for who knows? So he's playing us both? Of course. I'm on my way. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm looking for Prince Rupert's yacht. The royal yacht? Yes.

Yes, well, it's surprisingly spacious. Would you like a cup of tea? I'll make it this time. I should get going. Stay for a cup of tea. It'll fortify you for the walk I would have had a go, Milk? history. Not too much. Otherwise, it'll be a milky horror. As Gloria calls, it sounds best avoided. A milky horror. Not Gloria. What time will your friends be back? I don't know. by the way, here you've written a playlist. You were right. It helped me feel better about the ball helping conquer my fear. I'm glad. That's why I wanted to return the favor. I didn't need the backgammon set. Nursing. I asked for it Help you cope with something, too. You remembered what I said about being scared of the water. Sorry if I was. I know. It's okay. I appreciate you helping me. I can't say I'm totally over it, but I feel a little better. Same here. Is that why you came out here? And the most of my own destiny here. No duty, no tradition. I just wanted to enjoy my last That's such a bad thing. Surely you don't have to do this It's your choice. Choice It's not how it works. And one. If they don't, they at least ask you. You must have some input shortly. Who you're attracted to. Who you love. Love? My family arranged suitable candidates from suitable families Our parents decided I had to choose a bride They are prepared to enter an agreement Love isn't a factor. Well, it should be. I no, I can see why you come out here to escape. It'll do you good not to think Well, It's a big deal. You have to participate in it. What, are you, like it or not? You can still shape it in some way. I've got an idea. Why don't you telephone Sir that we're finalizing the play list, And what will we really be doing? Are we moving? Not just yet. I'm not sure I'm ready for this. Do you trust me? Did you enjoy it? It was delightful. So you enjoyed it? Yes. Especially now that it's over. Well, at least it wasn't just another day at work, was it? Well, I suppose I'd better go. Need to prep for the interview with the princesses Okay. Do you want me to order your car It's fine. You see? I think I'll stay tonight. Will you be back in time? Yes. See you tomorrow, then. Thank you for the tea. Good work, Lucy. I'll see you tomorrow and I'll be there. So you sail? I sailed. And you feel Now He's unhappy. And the weird thing is It's not weird. You like you want to be in his company. There's no future in it, though. Tomorrow You sure you need me for this? I want you to be here and see what I'm getting into. Here are the pre-agreed questions for the princesses. Are we ready? Shall I present the first candidate? Isn't she going to stand with what they'd be served to? Through? You know, I'm extremely relaxed about Lucy sitting. Please, Lucy, remain seated. Who is this? This is Lucy, my new pair. Awfully small courtyard room. If your family hasn't fallen on hard Don't be like that, Carrie. We've known each other since we were tots. Our parents had this arranged Let's get the formality over with, Ruth. I don't really know why I'm here. What do you need to hear? My plans for our living arrangements. Just as long as you don't interfere What's your favorite setting? My floors asked me a proper question, Roo. Well, I'd like to know. No. Okay. But how is you sound, New York. It's frightful. I was in Central Park. Just let one of my ponies Suddenly, What happened? Yes, Carrie, What happened? Well, rather silly. The police turned up, shouting at me So boring. I got two of them suspended. So that was fun. That's awful. I know the pony wouldn't harm anyone. No, I mean, getting two people suspended. Sounds a testing time, Caroline. I you to let your staff judge me I'm sure Lucy wasn't being judgmental. She was just taken by your predicament. You're wasting your time. Just tell them you've chosen me, The first thing I'll do is find you, and you pay. She seems nice. Who's your last medical? July. Any problems? I don't think so. What is your annual household profit? Personal. Household, Not the entire royal. Well, the prince wouldn't have access Well, not without consulting. What is your projected forecast Again, I see. Is there The prince asks his questions. Those sandwiches. Could you pack them for me? Have the ambassador coming. He can have them if he has an overspent. This should be Princess Ariella. Where is she? I like your earrings. Can I have them? Well. don't worry. You can present them to me at the end. I do like presents. Do you know Mommy It was one of the palace cellars. She had soundproofed and everything. Really? Yeah. Mommy said super thick walls create the best acoustics. So what did you think? Well, sometimes positivity isn't enough. Research. what am I doing? It's all awful. Which is released? Well, none of them want to marry me either. I know. Sorry if I'm like, a broken record. It's just that That's it, Lucy. I could run off to see. I just need some time to think. But you're running out of time. Just one evening. Just one evening. Away from all of this. What are you doing now? I'm so sorry. I'd love to, but my friend Gloria, She's hosting a charity event tonight. We promised her I'd be there for you. Are you allowed? A plus one. Lucy, Royal box? It's upstairs. It's not down here. This theater doesn't have a royal back. Full theaters have a royal box. I've never seen one without a yes. Still, that makes me probably Jolly good. You could probably ask them Holloway. I don't think I've ever had that before. What? People in front of me. What happens if you get a tall fellow Well, you just keep like this. You've got a little snake More like this. It might be able to work. At the end, there's a charity auction. Top prizes, dinner at our seniors. Two tickets, please. But if we get more tickets, Yes, but a whole bucket. Are you sure? I don't actually carry any money. Have any other guy said that to me? I think it was the worst line ever. Don't worry. I'll get it this time. Thank you. I'm royalty. I don't think she. Believe me. Here she is. You know, I think I saw Gloria's nutcracker Was she delightful? No, she was brilliant. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Delightful to meet you, Gloria. That was quite the performance. Your Highness is too kind. It's my absolute pleasure. And many congratulations on your prize. Who would have thought, with all the odds The question is, who do I take with me to see nerves? I could see if one of the princesses, even owe me more is just one of those. This is a better question here. What is the worst decision My worst decision? Well, that's an interesting one. I've not made a bad decision Really? Well, no, So James has made some shocking ones on my behalf. Going to have to make a decision for myself soon, though. Do you have a favorite? Isabella is bossy. Caroline is mean. Ariella is Ariella. So from them? No. And I'm not sure any of them would choose me Maybe we should finish up. Thank you for walking me home. Nonsense. Sighs You never find a taxi in a city like this. Thank you for your help. Your company has made this process I've enjoyed it too. It's been great. Is that what you said about your job with the bookstore woman Honestly, no. You stay in It can be hard to let go. Can it? Yes. You still want to make sure they're okay? Remember the other night That was Rhianna, the book. What ended up traveling most the night for her She was still working for her. No, no, I just answered her cry for help. That kind of labor in a lurch. She can't really manage on her own. This is me. Do you care so much about all the people you work for? Yes, But this is a special job. So it must have been hard for you when you were younger. Looking after your mother. Maybe that's why you're so dedicated. But it's fixed. You on one track to one track. I mean, it's not just about putting No, You have to write your own happiness. The right to enjoy, your freedom That's the true privilege, isn't it? The freedom to make your own choice. You're very fortunate. So make the most of that freedom. If see for both of us. Sorry. Goodbye. Listen. good morning, sir James. Good morning, Lucy. The chefs say everything is nearly ready Can't have come at a moment too soon. You are the. This dessert fork is too close What measurements are you working from? I just think of the guests contribute You're less likely to be out of pocket, So you don't write me. Have. I'm still. So let's your Highnesses, I know you've met Miss Woods yesterday. The Prince's Trust today just hired help. And she will kindly oversee the menu tasting, secure opinion on the proposed dishes and ensure I need to find the prince. Have you seen him? He's proving Not since last night has he? He walked me home around 11. I think I might, Your Highness. The first dish will be ready shortly. Sir, if you graciously take your seats. The ganache was too runny and the Duchess of York snaps. We can lose the gold I like the cold, though It didn't really Time a taste of guilty and what did you think of the dessert, It's cheap and tries far too hard. The prince seems to like it. What can I say? Sadly, Rupert can often be distracted Maybe there's an honesty to it It's an eminently forgettable, set Your Royal Highness. May I? What are you doing, girl? Did I tell you I'd finished Getaway? Honestly, I don't know why Rupert finds People. You're being unfair. How dare you? I'm sorry, Your Highness, Maria was merely preparing I'll do exactly as I want. Like this party, this confession of me. And. I just don't understand. Or Cena's was so great, I don't know if I did something wrong. Things were going so well. He's really honest with me about things. I don't think he talks like that Could he be gone to his boat? Probably. I know how unhappy is about a situation. I just don't think he can face it. What's expected of him? He's so different when. We're alone away from the royal residence. You miss him while he makes Dealing with But not just because of that. It's ridiculous. I know. and I just find it hard How much he's dreading this ball, I. I find it very hard not to think of him. You feel something for him, don't you? I've seen the way you look at each other. You think he's interested in me? Isn't it obvious? I just. His charm, though. I wish I knew where I stood. Look, you're both trapped. You by your job, him by his position It's so frustrating. I wish we had a chance to just see where we both stood. Now see ourselves as we really are. For once. Well, you could, but you both have to take a risk Think, sir. Hello? Are you escaping, too? Good to see you. And you? I was worried about you. I just needed some time. I understand. Where have you been? just a few places I knew in New York. I'm sorry I wasn't there for tasting. How does it go? Fine. Really. It was like herding cats. It all happened. Everything will go as planned, they desire. how rude of me. You've come all this way and I haven't Are the princesses ready? Nearly. I really need them down for practice now. Good heavens, James. Why are they taking so long? Well, I'm sure they'll be down shortly. Unfortunately, we had an additional delay as we had to get a new hairdresser She sent the other one away in tears. Well, I've got I really can't wait that much longer. Maybe I can hurry them along. No. Perhaps you could fill in for them and Sir James could stand in for me later. So they've a chance to practice. That's most unusual, sir. Nonsense. Three princesses to dance with. You have a lovely time. I really won't. Lucy, I have two left feet. That's okay. I have to write to come to port. Your Highness. May I present Princess Caroline, Gustaf of the Oslo States. She curses. He takes her home and music stops. He sings. May I have a dance? She said. You bet. So why not be serious? I would be honored. I think that's enough. We'll stop the music then. Yes. Don't worry. She'll take it more seriously. Where's the fun in that? I'm saving my voice. Amusing, you know, Steady. So much fun. Hi. And this concludes the dance with the second princess. I think it wants us to stop dancing. What do you think? I'm not going to do what's expected. Just this once. Stop the music. I'm here now. we were just practicing. You can send the staff away to give me that. And that. Thank you so much, Lucy. It was a pleasure. I will leave you both to practice, but I don't know why you're wasting your time on that little upstart. Yeah. No. Can I help you? I don't know how it stuck. It's not coming. Try again. It is most insulting instead of dancing with me. Well, Sushi's. And then I'll try again. my word. She's trying to steal the betrothal ring. No, I was just trying it on stealing it. No, I'm sure. She wasn't. I just walked by, and it looks so amazing. And I thought in the spur of the moment no. No harm done. I'd wager Are you talking about what? Brooch? Check her handbag. But this is most irregular. This is crazy. If it's crazy, I hope you're ready to apologize. Caroline. I had no idea. You have to believe me. I didn't put it there. I was right. She's a thief, an upstart commoner, and a thief. No. Obviously, I'm sorry. I had no choice. And under the circumstances, I can't give you a reference. But it's my dear Lucy. I wanted to write to you to I also wanted to let you know that for what happened and hope Thank you for making the past few weeks I wish you a happy life. Yours sincerely, Rupert. It's been three days. I just can't let it go. I keep going over it. I was totally unfair. But you know, He thinks it's all a big misunderstanding. And forget her. She just saw you as It's not her I'm thinking about. I'm sure he knows the truth. His letter suggests as much, doesn't it? Tonight's the night he'll pick one of the princesses Well, someone should give him proper choice. What do you mean? I mean you. You should go. You'll always wonder if you don't. Wonder What? What might have been He'd never choose me. Would you choose him? Yes. But who? Think. Give him a chance to choose you. He doesn't love these women. They don't love him. He's told you that repeatedly. This is crazy. I know what it's like, Lucy. I felt the same that night. I ran to the station. It's a risk, but I had to go. It's The only way you'll know What does your heart say? That I want to see him again. That's her answer. Yes. What? The purchase of first food. Once. Back yourself, Lucy. Trust and love. I don't have an invite. That's your invite. He'll be appalled. I've broken protocol. He seems quite happy to break it I don't have anything suitable to wear. Shall we? Royal gala, the Hamptons red carpet. He met ball. It's okay. It's more than okay. Wonderful. It's a nice ball. And I don't. A mask. you don't need one. We'll be late if we don't leave now. I don't have any mice for the pumpkin, but I do have my fairy coach Thanks. Gloria. I'm doing the right thing, Honestly, it's a tough thing you're doing. It would be easier to stay here. But if you do that, Evenings spent thinking. What if in days So, yes, it's a Gloria, I've never done this before. Putting Myself first. Putting love first. It's scary. It is scary, but it's so worth it. Come on. I spent too long talking like a demon. Is there a back entrance Yes. It's good. We might be able to sneak you in that way with the side entrance. You go on. I'm going to stay out here But what are you doing? I'm sorry, Sir James, I need to see the prince. He believes that that incident He doesn't blame you. It's not about that. Don't you think he should be free to I'm sorry, but. that's entirely inappropriate. But you must leave and Gloria not to be. Why weren't you at the station? Why? Where on earth were you? I was at the station. You weren't there. Where you. So was I. No, you weren't. I waited all night at Central West, I was at Central East. I waited on that platform all night until dawn. You never wanted to see me again. Same, Lucy. Let this be a lesson to you of communication. What do we do now? Right now, Then. Then we'll see. I missed you so much. We've both been given a second chance. Lucy needs hers. Presenting Princess Caroline of the Oslo States like the transcription. Princess How much does this all cost? I never approved payment for decorations. Princess Ariel of Augustine. Sorry. I didn't know it was for me. There was four of us. Really, Mother, you do pick them. no. Stop that, Faith. She's here to steal the ring. She was sacked for theft, here, sneaking around, Stop her. Have her removed. Call the police. No, no, She did it. Caroline. What? Not through her face. She was caught with stolen Was there. You are only stolen a cow. I was told to always be honest. And that's what I saw. I saw her put the branch in her bag. She's a servant. Ariella Why are you defending a servant? You wanted me out of the way. Is it talking to me? I think you should go, Caroline. So James will inform your family of this much regrettable. And the engagement. Read the room, sweetheart. It's not happening. By now, she can hear me. Shall we sing a song to make everyone No. Well, I mean, later. Once everyone is gone. Okay. I'm so sorry. You were falsely accused. I believed you. My hands were tied. The palace insisted on taking Caroline's It's okay. It's all worked out. Is that why you came back here? To clear your name? No. You told me that I shouldn't live my life for other people. So I put what I wanted first. And what do you want? I want you to be able I understand what you're saying. What are you? Ladies and gentlemen, Princess Isabella. Princess Ariella. I've made my decision. Thank you both for coming to the ball. You're both wonderful. Interesting and beautiful women. But you don't love me. You're polite enough to protest. But we have all been shown And to be honest, I don't love you. You should be free to find and marry So you're picking me? Or. Or not picking this with Ariella. You are free to find someone more suitable to duet with. I've been lucky enough to meet a very special person who has taught me the importance of choice and taught me the importance which is something I have never done until now. So finally, I've made my choice, and I'd like her This ring is only an offering, a symbol of my love for her to accept or reject Lucy, do you accept this ring? My heart. I do. And you do? Good.
