I think it's time we gave boats a little upgrade. You know, you're right Garrett. We absolutely should. I mean, look at these things. They're just so boring. They're so slow and unusable and I... (explosion) Oh, yeah. So I already gave it a little upgrade. And as you can see, it's quite fast. Oh my gosh. Oh geez. I know I coded this myself, but I forgot how insane it is. I'm just gonna fly down this river real quick. Ooh, drift around the side. Oh, just kidding. You can't drift. I'm way too fast for that. Uh oh. Oh geez. Okay. Oh, I'm breaking the sides. Oh geez. It's really hard to turn. Okay. It's really hard to turn. Oh coral reef. And just like that, the coral reef is gone. All right. See ya. Peace. Oh Gosh. Oh man. Oh, can I stop? I can't stop. Yeet. Okay. Oh, now it's just... All right. Okay. Okay. Woo. Yeah. That's... That's... (explosion) That's an upgrade. And there it goes. And it's still going. Oh, and it stopped. Yeah, this is a little explosive. So, it does destroy blocks. It's also a little loud. And if I get into it in survival mode, then I just explode. Cause that makes sense. Well, that seemed like a great solution, right? Because today I'm solving all your worst Minecraft problems by coding solutions into the game. I asked you on my community tab to give me your worst problems with Minecraft and I'll fix them. And sure enough, I went through and created a data pack that does just that. It's time to solve your worst problems with Minecraft in Minecraft with Minecraft features. That wasn't confusing at all. That being said, everything you're seeing in this video is done with Minecraft features and a little bit from the mod &quot;Pehkui&quot; just to change a little scale thing. You'll see why. And yeah, this boat thing... (explosion) I definitely thought that one through. I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna... Okay. Oh, I can't even... There's nothing I can... All right, it's just stuck here. It's just... (sighs) All right, who's first? Giants are too small. Oh yeah, for sure. They're definitely not called giants for any reason. No, of course not. So I did something a little wild. I made them bigger and gave them AI. Oh gosh, here it comes. And by gave them AI, I mean, I just kind of swapped them out with a zombie. It's the same thing, right? This guy now is insanely powerful. That was half my health. I'm gonna take him down. I'm gonna take him... Oh my gosh. I'm gonna get him. Oh, you can't even like fit him on the screen. That's insane. Oh, wait. Oh, he's invisible. Where did he go? Where did he go? (laughs) He's just gone. Where do you... Ah, there he is. This is the new giant. They're really powerful and really tall. And this is kind of insane. Look at this guy. Regular giants are about a third of the size here. This is just... This is ridiculous. All right, buddy. Come on, bring it on. You definitely don't have a hundred hit points. You definitely don't have that. He does have that. I lied. Oh gosh, he's gone. Where did he go? Where did he go? Where did he go? Why did he keep turning invisible? He can still hit me. Where did he go? No, please. He appeared just as I died. Yeah, this was a good idea. Now there's invisible zombies. Uh oh. I'm just gonna run. We're just gonna leave. We're just gonna... Oh gosh. I'm just gonna go. I'm out. Peace. See ya. Did I solve your problem? Was that a good enough solution? I think it was. I can't even like zoom in with how you just... It just doesn't fit. You're too tall. All right, who's next? Netherite upgrades are too rare. Make them well done. Oh boy. Yeah, that's a good play on words. Yeah, you know, I always find it really difficult to find Netherite upgrades in the world. First, you gotta figure out how to go to the Nether. And then that also requires a flint and steel. And then when you're there, you just gotta wander through all this ridiculous terrain. Oh man. Okay, this is just a pain, man. And then you gotta find a Bastion. Fight your way through all these just insane mobs. And then just hope you're lucky enough to find a chest that has one in it. I'm just gonna take that one. That was actually quite convenient. I didn't know I would find that. See, Brutes, painful. And they're just so rare. They're just so rare, man. I think we need to cook them more. Just gonna... Cool. Uh huh. Yup. Well done, smithing template. And as you can see, it says no longer a rare item because it's cooked. You see, it got burnt. It's well done now. You get it? You get it? Cause now it's not rare anymore. Cause now it's well done. Anyways, now you can also use it in a smoker. And because it's still kind of like a stone thing, you can also use it in the blast furnace. I'm just gonna do that. I'm just gonna let those cook. And then because we're just insane, I also made it so you can put them on the campfire. (laughs) Yup. Nice and well done. Some well done smithing templates. Did we solve your problem? Did I do it? Did I solve your problem? They still work. See, they still work. Did I solve it? Oh. Oh, it's delicious too. Oh, I forgot about that part. Yeah, that's right. Netherite upgrades are now edible. (laughs) I don't think these are rare anymore. I think these are really well done. Yeah. Yeah, this is weird. Anyways, let's move on to the next one. Oh, and you can still use regular netherite smithing templates if you want. But like the well done side is funny. Okay, it's funnier. And it's more delicious. All right, well now we're actually moving on. Anvils hurt you, but they don't squish you despite landing on your head. Yeah, normally they just hurt you like that, but this is a heavy object. This has gotta squish you, right? Gotta do more than just make a loud noise and deal damage. So I made it so it squishes you and it lands on you. Oh gosh. Yeah, this is, oh boy. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's weird. Oh boy. (laughs) Oh gosh, that was too much. Oh, what's that? You can't see me? Hold on. Boom, okay. Is that better? Oh no. Is it? Hey guys, how's it going? (laughs) Did it work? Did I do it? I made it work. Bang bro. Oh geez, oh my gosh. Bang bro, Minecraft is crazy. At least I can get into tighter space. Well, I'll see you guys later. On to the next one. (laughs) Oh, oh it's dark in here. Oh no. Oh gosh, I'm growing again. Oh gosh, I'm suffocating. Wait, wait, no. (chuckles) Just kidding, I can crawl. I told you I'm fine. (laughs) Oh, let's move on. (laughs) The fact that no texture in Minecraft says subscribe to Knarfy. Yeah, you know, that would be weird if it was true. Because I don't know if you've looked closely at some of Minecraft's textures, but you might see something familiar. Check this out. This is the Dark Oak Log. And if you look really closely right there, there's a little subscribe to Knarfy on there. There's a little subscribe to Knarfy. But that's not the only place. Check this out. This is the Acacia Log. It also says it right there even smaller. How about this, the Cauldron? If you look really closely, it says it right there on the foot. If you take beetroots and grow them all the way up, what's that? It says subscribe to Knarfy-- Secretly, every time you've had a birthday in Minecraft, it's all been pointing back to me. Let's just head down into this cave here. And oh, what's that? A cobweb? Oh, what's that? Subscribe to Knarfy. But if you haven't been watching closely on any of those, I'd be really surprised if you didn't see this one. Flowerpot Bamboo. Subscribe to Knar-- That one's actually really visible. I don't know how anyone's missed that. That's kind of insane. Yup, so it does say it. Which means you should subscribe to Knarfy. Fixed the problem. Actually, I didn't need to fix it. It was already in the game. Don't look it up. Don't, don't. Subscribe. That ladder in the new structure. Oh yeah, that thing I can't unsee anymore? Oh boy. If you don't know, in Minecraft 1.21, Mojang added the trial chambers and they had one fatal flaw. If you walk through a little bit, you'll probably find this room where you've got a couple cool mural things on the wall. This has got a breeze and a spider in it. There's some stuff over there, but you see anything out of place here? Yeah, take a quick look at those ladders. Something, something might be wrong. Yeah, they seem to have, seem to have messed this one up. Oh boy. But it's all right. I've got the perfect solution for you. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you watching? Watch very closely. Step one. Step two, fixed. See, now it's perfect. Oh yeah. Well, okay, wait, hold on. All right. Yup. Mm-hmm. Okay. All right, we'll just fix that one right up. Cool. Hold on. Hold on. Give me a second. Yup. Yup. All right, okay. There, see? Now it's even. Fixed your problem. All right, let's move on to the next one. I like solving these problems. They're so difficult. They're so hard to solve. A shulker drops zero to one shells. Yeah, shulkers aren't honestly worth the hassle sometimes. I think a lot of people just skip going to the end city entirely, I think I have a good solution for you. But to explain how it works, we have to talk about the mace first. And don't worry, this'll make sense in a moment. So the mace, hold on, let me build a tower. Don't move, pig. Don't move, all right, don't move. The mace is high risk, high reward. And as you can see, as I jump off here and I hit this pig, I missed. There's the high risk part. You take a lot of fall damage if you don't hit the thing. And I gotta show you the high reward. Where are you going? Come back here, pig. Come back here. Boom, it deals a ton of damage. So if you succeed in your thing, you get a lot of reward in the form of damage. But if you don't succeed at the thing, in the form of hitting the thing, you take a bunch of fall damage. High risk, high reward. Makes sense, right? Well, I would consider going to the end a high risk environment. Naturally, you've got the Ender Dragon to deal with. You've also got all these endermen all over the place. They're very annoying if you look them in the face. And then naturally, you've got the shulkers here at the end cities. High reward in the form of an elytra, which I guess this one doesn't have, but high risk in the form of these guys. So I've got another good reward for you. I've completely reworked the loot table of the shulker. Sometimes it'll give you absolutely nothing. I'm so glad that gave me absolutely nothing. It worked out quite well. And then other times, how am I supposed to get down there? Other times, it'll be an absolutely insane high reward. Come on, brother. Get out of your shell. Super high reward. Oh, geez. You just go into survival mode here. And yeah, that makes sense, right? So you've got high risk in the form of going to the end and high reward in the form of all of these shulker shells. Yeah. What a reward. This makes sense, right? This makes sense. And it's always like this. There's always too many for you to pick up or it gives you absolutely nothing. Zero or a billion. There's no in between. You literally can't pick them all up. How many are there? Let's just do this. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. That's a double chest full and I couldn't fit them all. Okay, hold on. I gotta do some math. Calculator. 64 times nine. Seven plus 64. There's 4,096 shulker shells here. Now that's what I call high reward. Am I right? I'd say I fixed your problem. And now I'm just gonna leave all of these here because I don't need them. Let's go. All right, bye. See ya. Bye, shulker shells. They're all just gonna despawn now. Bye, didn't need them anyways. It's a good time, huh? It's a good time. Mobs are kinda hard to see, so you should make them wider. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's a good way to see mobs better. Question mark? So I went ahead and I did that. As you can see in chat, wide mode enabled. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Just took that screenshot. (laughs) This is the best screenshot ever. This is awesome. This makes things more visible, right? There's a pig over there. Oh my gosh. Oh man, the rabbits. These are usually really hard to see. So this is actually kinda cool. Hey guys, don't mind me. Just looking at how wide you are. Now the pigs are wild looking. I think my favorite is still the squid. I think that's really funny. Oh gosh, the dolphin. The dolphin is wide. The fish, the puffer fish. They're definitely more visible. I'll give you that much. Oh my gosh, look at these guys. These guys look thicc. Oh my gosh, the turtle is huge. That's insane. What? Bruh. Okay, hold on. I need to figure out what the Ender Dragon looks like. Oh my gosh, the Enderman. Look at the Enderman. Oh, that's so good. Oh. Whoa. The end crystals are big too. What the heck? That's crazy. Wait, hold on. If I throw an item. Oh, it makes items wider. Everything is wider. That's crazy. That's crazy. Wait, hold on. Does this work on boats? Oh. Forgot we fixed that earlier. It sure does work on them. Oh my gosh. Look at you, dude. Oh geez. Can I even like ride it? Oh my gosh. Oh geez, dude. Whoa. What is happening? Whoa. Bye. I'm gonna go off into the sunset. I'll see you later on my wide boat. Whoa. I just launched myself. Okay. So this is cool. Oh, oh, oh. There's a boat here. Hey man, how's it goin. So everything is wider, but that does have a couple downsides. For one, you can't fit through doors anymore. You're just a little too wide. You can still go through the nether portal though. So that's a plus. But the other major downside is that it also affects the giants. So yeah, that's pretty wild. Yeah, this is cool. Hey man, I think he's too wide to even attack me now. Oh man, this is a wild video that we find ourselves in today. And that's another golden screenshot. Cool. Love to see it. So I fixed your problem, right? This guy's pretty visible. Yeah, yeah, fixed it. Fix your problem. It means I can turn it off now, right? That means I can go back to the way things were. How do I do that? The fact that when goats headbutt you, it doesn't send you absolutely flying into the distance. Yeah, I think that would make sense, right? Just like they just smash bros launch you into the distance. I think it's a great idea. And you know what does that just intrinsically? This guy, Minecraft's new mob, the breeze. Hey buddy. These guys fire wind charges at you that launch you into the distance. So I figured, why not apply this logic to goats too? Wind charges are cool, right? Like more mobs should be able to use them. I think they're cool. I think it's great. What could possibly go wrong? I'm just gonna spawn a bunch of these guys and we're just gonna wait for one of them to hit me. Come on guys, I know you want to. I know I'm annoying. I know. Yeah, I'm here. I'm just here to bug you all. I'm here to bug you. All of you are dumb and your horns are weird. Yup, that's right. I said it. I said it. Your horns are weird. Yup. Anyone gonna take a shot at me? Yeah. Anyone up for it? All right, come on guys. I know you can do it. (imitates dog barking) That's what you sound like. You sound like that. (GOAT SCREAM) (laughs) That was an in-game sound effect for the record. That was insane. (laughs) Wha--, one of them is a screaming goat. Where is he? Oh! (laughs) I guess we'll never know. Wow! Oh my gah--! That was a baby goat. I didn't even realize they could do that. (laughs) Yeah, so that works really well. Oh, there goes another one. Yup, uh-huh. Oh, and you can also see it launches the goat as well. Rip goat, yup. At least I don't take fall damage because wind charges. This is awesome. This is one of my favorite things ever. (laughs) I love that it just flings you like crazy. (imitates goat sounds) Come on, one of ya. Oh, geez, I was not expecting that. Oh my gosh. Oh no, the goats, the goats, man. They just die when they fall. It's so sad, it's so sad. Goats are crazy, man. Yeah, goats are insane, but I'd say this fixed your problem, right? That's fixed your goats. Fixed your, oh. Creepers aren't explosive enough. Oh yeah, that's an easy fix. This right here is a very normal creeper. And if I go into survival mode, you'll notice that their heads aren't good at turning anymore, which is a side effect of them Oh... instantly exploding. Woo! Yup. Was that enough of an explosion for you? Creepers, they got a little downgrade in not being able to look around, but that's all, that's the only downward grade there. That's, wow, wow, wow. I didn't really like this island anyways. Oh look, it's my well done smithing templates. I'm gonna go grab those. Oh, geez. Yum, delicious. Yeah, I think I solved your problem. Yeah, they're kind of gross actually. I'm just gonna get rid of those. We got one more. Darn, finding a stronghold takes a lot of work. If only there was a way to simplify it. Yeah, let me just walk you through the steps of finding a stronghold real quick just to refresh your memory. We start by going to the nether and finding a fortress. Then you find a blaze and kill it for the blaze rods. Don't forget to get an absolutely insane amount of them. Perfect, that's enough. Then you have to find this blue place and kill a bunch of endermen for the ender pearls and they don't drop 100% of the time. Don't forget to get an absolutely insane amount of these too. It's gonna take longer than the blazes I think. Perfect, that's probably enough, right? Then you gotta craft an absolutely insane amount of blaze powder and an absolutely insane amount of eyes of ender. Yeah, that should be enough I think, okay. Then you gotta throw it, you gotta figure out where it's going and then you gotta follow them that way. This is painful, this is painful. If only there was an easier way to do this. And then sometimes it's just in the ocean and then you have to go under the ocean. (groans) And then finally you make it and then you have to run around the stronghold to figure out where you're going because oh no, it doesn't lead right to the portal. No, why would it do that? And then when you make it there, I give up, I'm doing an easier option. Remember those endermen from earlier? Well, something these guys are known to do is pick up blocks and then teleport around with them, which can get really annoying for building things but I think we can harness this for good. Instead of them just teleporting other things, they can teleport you. Where'd he go? Where'd he go? Sweet! And now I can just go right to the end and all my problems are, oh, I guess you probably should have a pickaxe or, oh and also the ender dragon, I get, oh, oh, oh yeah. But I wasn't trying to solve those problems. All I needed to solve was getting to the stronghold. That's it, that's all I needed. Oh hey man. Oh, oh right. (laughs) How do you get out of the stronghold? You just go into the, you just end up in the end, you get teleported, sometimes you die though, but then you have to get teleported back. Oh man, oh, okay, maybe this wasn't a good idea. What, what, what, what? Oh hey man, how's it go? All right, back to the end I go, I guess. Oh boy, man, I love this, this is so fun. Man, what a great solution to this problem, wasn't it? Oh hey guys, oh man, oh man, I'm in this, man. How do I get out of here, man? I solved way too many problems, I don't even know what to do now. I solved all your problems, what else do you want from me, man? I don't know what else to do. I can't get out, how do I get out? How do I get out, man? Oh no, how do I get, oh, I'm out. Thanks for watching. (laughs) I'll see you guys next time, speeding away. Oh shoot, I forgot how to use, oh no. (upbeat music)
