Welcome to Sad Boyz, - and other things also. I'm Jarvis. (laughing) And today, And I know I'm gonna say this wrong, - and I learned once how to say it. - Mmhmm. - You didn't do your research? was hoping that my memory would help me. Is it &quot;Lan-je-vin&quot; or &quot;Lang-e-vin&quot;? - Neither. Oooooh. Who wants to shoot him first? - (Jordan quick-drawing) - &quot;Lahn-je-vin.&quot; - Technically - Like the Lance of Longinus. I had a mnemonic in my head, I don't think I technically The French Canadians are always like, But then they don't tell me You don't have to listen to them. That's how my family says it, They're top of the list - Yeah, who cares about French Canadians? - Pick a lane. - Hey, whoa, come on. Love Canadians. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. But I think that it's to try and take over Canada like that. Unless they were the first. Emma, I would describe you - That's fair. The opposite of a comfort creator. - (laughing) A discomfort creator? You're like the bed of needles that - Even &quot;creator&quot; is a loose term, 'cause you have to post to be a creator. You'd think so. - Jordan's been - I was gonna say, Jordan's been I'm the devil of podcasts, you know? I'm a devilish little don't-do-nothing, - call-yourself-a-creator type. - But you're currently a New Yorker. And you are from that part of the States. - Yeah, I'm technically from Jersey. - But then you - why'd you grimace? You know? I'm from there, - but I don't claim Jersey. - Ooh, rough. My thoughts exactly. That was - [EMMA] Yeah. 'Cause I'm not from there. - It's a horrible place. - You know? That, I connect with. You know, Jordan, I feel like, you know... Would you describe yourself - or not claiming Stroud? I'll stay with it, you know? It's like being an alma mater Yeah, it's one of those things, like, whenever you describe it, Like, you don't... paint a beautiful picture. You don't weave a rich tapestry. But then if you were to describe, - That sounds so, like... No, it's nice. I mean, it's nice. The people are nice. It's just... I imagine it's just like... if you move so far away I like all the stuff it wasn't. I prefer open environments, - Consistent sun. And I hate hills. &quot;This represents everything I'm not. As you get older, maybe that matters less. Like, how long were you Um, I lived here for two years, but then I also lived What was the timeline of Nevada? Um, like 2019. I lived in Vegas for like three months, and then I lived in Reno - (laughing) for six months. - I'm so curious what brought you there. - E-dating. It wasn't a vibe. If someone loves you, they won't There we go. Let it be known. Etch that in stone, actually. It's one of those relationship tests. Like, &quot;Doing the Reno test - No, for real. I didn't know I could find - and then I moved to Reno. - What do they have there? I don't know. - Yeah, &quot;Hold my coin.&quot; I guess he's got a residency. - [JORDAN] He's lost. When I picture Jeff Dunham, Doesn't matter where. He's at a buffet. - It's fused to his hand. And not in a weird way. It's just got a - small pillow next to him. - (laughing) Yeah. So, you moved to LA for a couple years I was here for two years, and then... I don't know. I wanted to Right. And then now this is your - but more like a... You were here for two years. like a stop-coming. I don't know. - There's not a word for that. Homeleaving. Anyway, I like it. I miss it a lot. I may have got too silly - Hey, that's life. I don't know. I wish I could split Some people do. I mean, - Like, split - Yeah, that used to be my thing. Yeah, and then also on the - - Was it the first Nephilem drop? - The two-tone hair? - That's why you were doing it. when I had that hair, so I just kinda - so I could use it as a sona for things. - That's very smart. - Wise. What's the day-to-day? Um, well... I don't know anybody that lives - My family is like an hour away. But, um... Yeah, nobody lives out there, so I just kind of sit, and I work, and I hang out with my dog. And that's kind of it. You know, that is exactly what for the first two years. - Yeah. Nobody wanted to hang out with you. That was me with my first six months here. I moved, uh, right... right before lockdown. - Ooh. I moved - OK. - End of 2019. Yeah. - (laughs) OK, hold on. Hold your horses. Um, right... I got a couple months in of, like, &quot;OK.&quot; &quot;I know people in this town. I'm gonna&quot; - - &quot;Oh, I have to stay in forever?&quot; &quot;I have to stay in, and play RuneScape for 2 years straight?&quot; - &quot;I have to do it!

What's work for you right now? Um, I basically - I usually - I wake up at a crisp 1:00 p.m. - Um, 'cause my insomnia's terrible. - [EMMA] Yeah, I did my best. Um, and then, yeah, I call my business partner and and work on the brand, I was watching, um, just a little update video That is like its own clothing company. - There's a difference between merch - - Exactly. - They mean well, and they're wrong. I know a lot of influencers have just a way to generate money. But this and I actually give a shit, - The clothing brand is the first piece. [JARVIS] Which is awesome. And I think that there are to be a creator or to be creative, and sometimes you have to - and see what sticks. Do you feel like you've found Yeah. I... It was really weird. When I was was be a fashion designer. And then I didn't consider it actually And then I realized I had 'cause my friend V, who's my And he's just run multiple and he can just do everything. He's just one of those people. He's owned all types of shops. So then one day &quot;Hey, should we just 'Cause I need a job.&quot; (laughs) You know? - &quot;And I have ideas, and I have a vision.&quot; I already thought I remember hearing it a couple years ago, And I just always had it - Yeah. is start the brand, and then what, - &quot;Oh, I'll do it, the thing&quot;? - &quot;Oh, it happened. Shit.&quot; in life, you wanna find ways to use... you know, the... stuff that you've accumulated, you know, if you have you wanna find a way... You know, there's gotta be if I've got all these things? have an audience that you've built and if you decide, &quot;Hey, - but I can still pivot this attention...&quot; &quot;and the people who are following me excited about something, and Yeah, they just wanna see me - [JARVIS] That's great, though. Is that the number-one priority Is there any other plate Yeah, basically working on um, is kinda the thing. Are you guys familiar with - - Kind of a thing? Yeah, it's basically like toys, - Oh. Is there like a famous one Uh, maybe not by - you know Lego-looking Mickey Mouse things that rich people will have? - They're called Bearbricks. That's probably one of the most - That makes sense. He's also kind of Mickey-looking adjacent, like a little skull dude, - and they're called KAWS Figures. If you saw them, like, - you'd recognize what it was. Yeah, OK. But I wanna really get into - the vinyl toy industry. We definitely know - there's some we both know from work - Oh, yeah. - I think Sam has some, definitely. It could be any Sam. You don't know. Just check who we worked with. (laughs) Um... That's kinda sick. Is there, like, I don't know. I've been for like two years now, - so it keeps kinda... It's fine. I won't be in your lane. It would be fun to just Fun content. Just start a podcast. - It isn't even out yet. &quot;Hey. Who are these people with the mic? Who do they think they are? Us?&quot; &quot;Why's he talking about - &quot;That's ours!&quot; &quot;That's my stuff.&quot; So, there's that. I don't know. I go back and forth with the content thing, 'cause I'm just scared. And having a lot of attention But then also I wanna be successful - [JARVIS] Right. I think that's relatable And I think that's valid, also, because... Sometimes there is this narrative, and I see it a lot with very big &quot;You asked for this. You've and you're not allowed to 'cause people wanna be in And, while I can empathize with, like, where someone is coming from there, there is just the natural, like - Everyone goes through We have the same, you know, and ups and downs You don't wanna set Everyone has the capacity and if you don't reach Like, if you feel bad about something, it That's when you start feeling good, But if you start, you wanna do something It's not like transferable Like, &quot;Wow, I'm in great shape. That means I'm not sad - Right. [EMMA] No, exactly. Yeah. I also randomly went viral one day, so it was kinda like, Yeah, you quite literally didn't ask to - I did, but I didn't. Like, Right, 'cause if you're becomes known as the This is somebody we talked about. - 'cause a dude had explosive diarrhea. Termed, what was it, a biological event? - Yeah. It's like, if I'm gonna be famous, You could say, you know, we live in a time where people can become popular simply for having an airplane freak-out or having a viral photo of them, or there's also those videos who became memes at an early age. Do you guys remember Balloon Boy? - Oh my god, yes. That was crazy. 'Cause it's nothing. &quot;There was a balloon around, I watched a two-hour documentary 'cause he was this adventure dude. There was all these conspiracies about - You know, 'cause the kid said, I don't know. I feel like that haven't made up their mind and I think maybe Oh, interesting. Maybe he was a balloon, Welcome back, by the way? I got here Thursday, - Classic Thursday-to-Thursday. but I have a dog back home, - What's your dog? - [JARVIS] Awww. You ever put him in a backpack, - They have breathing issues and stuff. He's also slightly too big. So it's kinda risky, - [JARVIS] Yeah. in the airport just seems like a lot when you're traveling alone, especially. But I wish. I love him so much. If I could bring him, I would Are you a not-loving-travel kinda person? - Yeah. I hate it. I, like, projectile-vomited They could've grounded the plane, - and then you could've been - I, like, made it. It was during takeoff. - You got the wrong memo. - You were like, &quot;Takeoff? I will.&quot; Yeah, I ran to the bathroom, &quot;The seatbelt light is still on!&quot; It's a thin plastic partition. I think he heard me - You know, &quot;We should let her in there.&quot; Yeah, I don't know. It was kinda sick. I don't know what happened. It was early. Maybe it's 'cause Sometimes your body just does - Yeah. I'm usually fine, you know? I was like, &quot;OK.&quot; - and played Suika Game for the rest of it. - We now know that. - No matter what your sickness is. will have that experience out of their Suika Game-based Ugh. Maybe that should be my calling. - [JARVIS] That's your content pivot. The Nephilem wellness program. - Just game out on a plane. - &quot;Are you chronically ill?&quot; &quot;Buy a Switch.&quot; Just buy a Switch. I feel like you have made mental health... conversations and talk a big part of your content and stuff. It's always, to me, seemed very approachable and relatable. Yeah. When you're crazy, so if I do some weird shit, people are like, &quot;Oh, OK, Not a lot of people I think it takes a Yeah. Like, I know there's a lot wrong So, you know, I can't really hide - I think I do a pretty good job. I hide it somewhat well - You're being insane right now. - It's fucked up. I start chewing on my hand. (all laughing) This is - I mean, that's... That's an interesting - Like, preemptive. It's like, &quot;Hey, if I do You're not gonna be like, - Yeah. There were signs. just by looking at me, It's nice to set that up. Like, - &quot;No, you're not profiling. Don't worry.&quot; Like, this has been a thing. This was a thing A little triangle &quot;Give me extra space - Yeah, exactly. the caution signs. I'm like, &quot;Hey, you - [JARVIS] Right. [JORDAN] That wasn't - &quot;You made me be a truck.&quot; so you blew me up. So if anything happens, - True. I warned y'all. I've been So if I go off the rails, you know, You're sneezing and coughing, - &quot;I'm sickly.&quot; Like if you take the tag off of your bed, It's like, &quot;You wanted this. - [EMMA] That's it. That's what being insane is. You pull it off. The warranty goes away. You're like, &quot;Now I have to take meds.&quot; - Yup. - Um... - We can talk specifics. Yeah, what the fuck is up? Yeah, I don't know I mean, we get as real - - Which one do you wanna start with? - I don't care. I'm, like, transparently nuts. Like, I was late-diagnosed - Oh, really recently. OK. When I was like 23. So, that was fun. (laughs) - Yeah. That explains every social interaction and why people would just randomly Was there like a catalyst - Well, I always knew I was a little freak. Like, I knew there was Because I've been in kind of - on and off since I was like 15. I started therapy around then, and stuff. And I knew I was crazy. in middle school and high school. I dropped out of high school And, again, in hindsight, But also, like - like, - &quot;I should've put up a warning.&quot; So, I knew something was wrong, and I kinda got diagnosed And then I was like, &quot;OK. There's no way I could have generalized anxiety disorder, and all these other I'm like, &quot;I feel like there's gotta A lot of those things, too, intertwine so much, or depression and ADHD intertwine so much. That, like, how could - &quot;I know it's A, B, C, D, E&quot;? And they just, like... I don't know. My therapist 'cause she had weird beliefs. - [BOTH] Ohhhh. I started suspecting it when I was like 18, when I was working at GameStop. My manager, I was talking about And he was like, &quot;Hey, do you have autism?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I took an online autism test at work, 'cause that's what you do - (both laughing) - But then - - It's like, &quot;I'm autistic, actually.&quot; - &quot;I'm wrapping up a Quizlet.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;Oh, I'm Lisa.&quot; which mentally ill media character For real. Like, &quot;Sorry, I'm just Yeah, &quot;Can you wait?&quot; &quot;Can you shut up? No, it's, like, actually. Um, yeah. So I asked my therapist and she was like, &quot;I can tell you're not.&quot; - And, um, I don't know. - [EMMA] &quot;I just know.&quot; - That's not what your job is. Just a doctor looking at you, - OK, but that shit happens. Literally, which pisses me off. It's like, if you're you get such, uh... They just sniff you. I feel like I have to have some overlap in background with me - to get a real read. to get any doctor to listen to me, ever. - Like, mental health or regular health. Yeah. I've had to throw a temper tantrum, &quot;We'll do whatever the fuck - Yeah. A little kid at a grocery store They're like, &quot;Uh, OK, we'll go home.&quot; No, like, actually. I mean, I'm sure there's - I mean, - A different person did the assessment. I was on - I kinda had to 'cause I was on meds when I was 17. And then I fat and I shaved my head, and that was a really weird I just kinda went crazy, And then I tried them again you know, the internet's mean. And I was like, &quot;Maybe I need meds.&quot; and I was basically just - Um... Honestly, I'm amazed I made it through it, - [JORDAN] Respect. It's also, like, you had - You were trying to get help. what to do. And I think it's insane without trying to diagnose you I find that absolutely bonkers, 'cause - Because I had autism, putting it doesn't do anything for autism. So I kinda narrowed it down. or, again, autism. I also - and, um... Yeah, I was gonna give up. I'd been trying to figure it out. Um, and then, literally, a fucking TikTok shows up talking about how she got diagnosed. And the doctor who did it specializes in women and nonbinary people specifically. So I was like, &quot;OK, as a Hail Mary, let me - an autism assessment costs. And it was like, &quot;If I'm not, because I spent $3,000.&quot; It's like getting a surgery - [EMMA] Exactly. And, you know, it was like two weeks of testing and interviewing my family. I had to answer, like, and give her my whole And yeah, then she was like, and it was that, - with ADHD and CPTSD. Did they - has that had an impact - I mean, I don't know if - not specifically - because you have - ? It contextualized everything - 100%. and situations I was in and be like, &quot;Oh, - Forgive yourself for those, like... I knew I was off. I knew I was weird. Everybody made sure - &quot;Hey, just checking in, you're insane.&quot; - &quot;Oh, I was thinking that as well.&quot; - Um, you know... Yeah. Uh, so it all just kinda worked out. But no, it was such a relief. For me, Like, I couldn't rest until It's - so, yeah. That is something that Like, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until... or, like, anxiety/depression but I was like a fully-functional adult with all these experiences I was like a pinball that was... or like one of those plinko games where I happen to be bouncing around - to even be a functional adult. And I was like, &quot;Well, I'm here, and I have the means now And then the actual progress can start, because you have a name and you have literature and experiences from other people that I remember my, um... Like, one of the small - I talk One of the niche sort of - I wanna say &quot;comorbidities,&quot; but one of the niche sort of side things that is often associated with ADHD - rejection sensitive dysphoria. And that, when I was a kid... I was always experiencing that, in certain situations where And my brain would just go, like, blank, where I couldn't... I would just feel horrible, and like I wanted to sort of And I would just go nonverbal and sit, and then all my friends would be like, And it wasn't even anything serious, ever. Like, it's such a And I just thought I was weird. - You know? Emmaisms or Jarvisisms or, like, &quot;That's just a trait I have.&quot; And then you get some kind of and then it's like, &quot;Oh, no, I just have all the symptoms of that condition, Yeah, I was always told That's a big thing with women, too. 'Cause especially at parties and stuff a lot of times I'd get overwhelmed and not talk to anybody I didn't know what that was. Dude, that is such a deranged assessment. What, she wants attention, Doesn't wanna talk to anybody &quot;Dude, this person's not coming to - from us at the event.&quot; The other thing is attention-seeking So if someone is &quot;faking symptoms&quot; they're also probably still mentally ill. Like, that's not That's where it's like, That's a thing that arbitrarily &quot;Aw, they can't have peanuts? - Stop showing off.&quot; It's easier than, like, For me, and it sounds like is like, the silver lining is &quot;I don't... this doesn't feel right to me. I don't want this. It just is happening, So at least when I am seek treatment, or I can seek answers and try to then give people And when I'm spiraling with I'm just like, &quot;Hey, this - ah, - Everything's just really bad right now.&quot; When you get that, do you 'Cause I got the ADHD diagnosis, was six months later, what I later learned was bipolar II, was my hypermania was so much 'cause it wasn't being methods, medication, with that one especially, I just had this clarifying go through the archive of all of or resentful moments and... you know, see them critically from outside, - Yeah. &quot;I feel like I wasted all this time, or I could've made I could've been more active Or, actually, the big one was I just thought of myself and thought of myself It was never, like, sometimes too focused, sometimes whatever,&quot; was never like, &quot;You are bad at this.&quot; It is, &quot;You are bad at this I'm like, &quot;Well, yeah, I'm, like, just going I'm not going home &quot;I should've done my work. Oopsie.&quot; And now, in retrospect, I can mourn - that just didn't know. But I assume that... every difficult interaction, routine, work, anything, the results of autism, - or however you wanna phrase it. Results of the cocktail. Especially when you're growing up, every - We're treated as if everything And, like, so, you make good decisions; you're good. If you weird people out at a party, If you look different, then even if it's just how - Yeah. And it's such a Or not even It just sucks. (laughs) - Like, bullying can be so - It can be such an extreme - have such an extremely negative effect, because it's happening at this like, discover yourself and figure out and things are going on that you and people are telling you - &quot;I guess I'm that, then?&quot; How does the term feel? I know some people are hesitant 'cause there's negative You're very candid about it. Yeah, I don't really care. I don't know. I think it's also because I've just been so another - labels don't Also, it's not a bad word. It's like, &quot;OK, this is just - Like, this is it. I can't control it. I don't really know. Everybody's so I don't know. But after your diagnosis, did you get recommendations of how to Or is it more like avoiding I mean, I kinda had a grasp on - how to handle myself at that point. Yeah. I definitely got off meds. If meds work for people, I've only ever had miserable They've just never done anything for me. So, I know I probably But I kinda know - Like, 'cause I know things that will I'm pretty good at setting boundaries I kinda got to that - things I had to experience. Yeah. I don't know. I kind of... you know, became a bitch as a - You know? So... - [EMMA] Yeah. Also that. It's fun, and then it's also, you know, it keeps people from - (Jarvis &amp; Jordan laughing) It helps to be intimidating. Does it feel like - I mean... To be fair, moving around a lot is... I would assume, maybe incorrectly, is... maybe difficult. I know, commonly, autism presents in some cases as, like, change is difficult, or immediate - - It's hard to adapt. 'Cause no matter what - I was like, &quot;I need to That's where all the - [JORDAN] Sopranos are there. &quot;I need to get out of here.&quot; - So it's kind of a survivor's instinct. where everyone is gonna agree with you. - They're like, &quot;I know.&quot; [JARVIS] Yeah, no one asks why. Just someone who, like, &quot;Oh, yeah, good idea.&quot; - Yeah, it's 107deg. who are mad about this, Yeah. You're the person that so, like, you know. &quot;'Ey, I'm not likin' these Sad Boyz &quot;The water's different,&quot; or whatever. - (all laughing) Las Vegas stresses me out. - I know that's not what Nevada is - I felt like I was gonna get - It's weird. - Isn't Area 51 there? Like, I thought it was freaky, where if you stand anywhere you can, - It just felt like I was in a hole. - It's just a creepy-ass place. I mean, my only experience of Nevada - is Vegas. - But so much of it is just - public bathroom has &quot;If you're being trafficked, Every single spot on the Strip, - I would see in Summerlin and shit. - Which is a good, like, resource, right? - It's also terrifying. You're like, &quot;At any moment, - what's gonna happen?&quot; - Every sign just says, &quot;Look out!&quot; - &quot;Whoa, why?&quot; - &quot;No reason.&quot; I do love a little bit of a gamble, like I like a Pokemon card or I like... What do I like? - I love a Genshin Impact. You get a cool - are they in Genshin Impact when you open a guy? I don't even know. I play it, - I just say &quot;little guy.&quot; - Yeah, when you get a rare guy. I played Genshin Impact like, uh, for, I don't know, a dozen hours You get a guy and he's got stars. - Is it stars that he has? I don't know. - The rarity thing, and you're like - And you're like, &quot;Oh, fuck yeah, dude! - I'm actually a better person now.&quot; Like we went to a Pokemon GO event, um, - this weekend at the Rose Bowl, - and it was fire, dude. Ohhhh. Oh, you don't even Shoutouts to the Johnnies, by the way. - You were very friendly, very nice. so we were both at the and a ton of people who were A couple of people came up and said that got them into the game, from across the country - Aw! - It was like - I have, so... What about Jordan? Shoutout to Pokemon Company International. This is not sponsored, - [EMMA] Yeah, me too. Yeah, so... So, Pokemon GO was at the - It was at the peak of peaks back in 2016, - Yeah. But when you have like the fall-off is like there are still - tens of millions of active players. - Oh, yeah? That's really sweet. My partner's entire family - is now really active in the game. shoutout, Trey - brought his mom and dad out. I'm friends with them on Pokemon GO. And it was the dream. I... I was saying this on stream. Maybe I just don't do anything but it's very cool to see... an environment, like a space, where all of these people from, from very, very young to, like, you know, grandparents, uh, all sharing in the same... experience. It's like... It's not like they're sharing It's like, &quot;Oh, you've got the Pikachu Like, I met a woman from, um, - Boston, and - And - close. And, uh... And she wanted - I wanted Armored Mewtwo. She wanted my, uh, shiny Tropius. - And we traded - she was - She was - OK. (all laughing) She was so stoked. We hugged afterward. - It was so wholesome. She was like, &quot;I hope you have And we would never And I love that. Like, - It was a very sweet day. Do you have a similar... type of person, if somebody comes up to you, &quot;Oh, this is a Nephilem-er&quot;? Um... Yeah, kind of. They always have - I do know the look. and it's like, &quot;OK.&quot; Sometimes it's a look and a look back. Yeah, I've definitely gotten - like, it's - I went to Disney with my family last year, and I could tell when people were looking, and I'm with my family. And I'd be like, - &quot;That guy knows who I am.&quot; And they'd eventually come up You don't wanna seem conceited, 'Cause they stare at you. - Right, and it's not a normal stare. Like, you see them do it. I never used to be able to, though, 'cause I also just don't look Like, I'm kinda just - I'm just like, &quot;Get to where I'm going.&quot; But now I'm definitely 'Cause also, I've always so people have always - But now I'm really aware of it. &quot;Look at these - - Yeah, we're here. Sorry, I actually got - Oh, yeah. You can do that after. We'll, uh, shut off the mics - - Turn up the gain. so everyone can hear you. &quot;Hey, what's going on with, &quot;Why's she got all this (laughs) Yeah, what's the deal? Would I look nice? - &quot;I bet when&quot; - &quot;Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.&quot; &quot;What if I held up a magnet to your face?&quot; - Nothing. It's not magnetic. - They use different alloys for that. Are you tempted to come back to LA? Oh my god, I miss it. Yeah. I don't know. Again, I don't know. I work like I'm way more focused, you know? - When you're in New York? 'cause also I have - [JORDAN] Fair enough. So, I don't know. I like it. Again, I don't know. I have mixed feelings. But I miss everybody. I'm so lonely. All my friends are here. and I hung out with some friends and I was like... It makes me so emotional. I don't know. Some people do that, but then [EMMA] Yeah. The thing is the dog. If I didn't have my dog - and I love him. But, um, or if I could drive, - so that's a whole thing. Yeah? Hell yeah. We're all late drivers here. - Jordan's still working on the license. I'm nuts. I shouldn't have whenever I want. You know? I have this runaway thing, which which is partially why I moved 'Cause I'd just have a bad day, Like, I'd just be MIA. &quot;I didn't even know you could do that. I would do some weird shit, I think. It'd be like, &quot;Oh, I'm in Cancun.&quot; - [JORDAN] &quot;I don't know.&quot; - &quot;It's scary. I'm on a beach.&quot; - and now I'm here on a beach.&quot; Yeah, &quot;I started a new life.&quot; - &quot;I have a five-year-old somehow.&quot; I hear you, but I also believe that, like, Those experiences help build in your brain, like, a response where, when you're like, &quot;OK, I wanna go away, but then when I do that... I tried it.&quot; Instead of, &quot;Hypothetically, because then what would happen? You'd be like, &quot;Well, I tried that so now I have that - which I think is valuable. Moving's never been a thing - I'll probably move around forever. Yeah, 'cause when I was, you know, wrapping up college and everybody A lot of people stayed around in the area. Like, I went to school in Georgia. And - which is, you know, (laughs) a step up from Florida, at the very least. Uh, and the... Damn, we're really taking them down. - Destroyed. - Yeah. Nevada, forget about it. - Nevada, Reno. (Jarvis &amp; Jordan laughing) Um, but anyway, we had some, um, some topics that 'cause there's just And that's kind of - this is the part &quot;Hey, we had a thumbnail 'cause nobody clicks on those. Now we're gonna talk about feelings.&quot; - We got you. portion of the show. But also, maybe we're doomed. (laughs) So... Uh, Jordan, you've seen some of the Project Sora stuff. - I know you haven't. - You've seen none? OK, so we're gonna set this up. OpenAI, uh, largest AI company right now. - They're the creators of ChatGPT. Uh, they recently had where they ousted their CEO and then It was a whole season of Succession - He came back as an android. (all laughing) - He had a cybernetic eye. &quot;There's no time to explain. Uh - yeah, &quot;In my time, We have to change.&quot; - Um, OK - Yeah, &quot;The movies are bad.&quot; We - uh, monitor But... oh, yeah, can we So the Project Sora is... now, instead of - they also do DALL*E, which is like the image generator. Um, AI image generator. [JARVIS] I know. [JARVIS] And the video... Have you seen Will Smith eating spaghetti? - No? - It sounds like a euphemism. - I had to take it in first. to hear for the - like, - Like, &quot;All right.&quot; So, this is - We were - last year, around this time, we were We were talking about the - yada-yada. - Dude, you're making eye contact with it. - Are you sure? No, he can. Um... - (all laughing) He starts running at me. (both laughing) Old spaghetti wobbling So, this video went viral, because of the way that it looks. - Um, so let's watch that. OK. This is important to know, like, (Jarvis &amp; Jordan giggling) This is a FNAF, like, But, OK, while it is bad, there are elements of it that are like... Every individual, like, - if you just took a piece - Yeah. You're like, &quot;OK, that's an ear.&quot; - &quot;That's a low taper fade.&quot; - Yeah. &quot;Hey, you didn't say I technically showed you - And now - We don't literally have We do have this video, which is AI-generated. - [EMMA] I could see that. - Oh, it's Will Smith! It's Will Smith eating puppy. But yeah, it's like - Is there an - and they said it's just - I wouldn't question it. Is there an updated Will Smith just posted a video of himself actually - Get out of here, Will. - She's pretty far off the bed. It's crazy. I don't like that. - If it wasn't for her face. Yeah, these are a few... Like, this is AI-generated. This is one year. I think that's the craziest thing. - Is that this is just one year. - No, it's AI. - No, he's not real. Yeah, that's Mark. This one, the prompt was for a spaceman who wears a knitted helmet. - And it's like... Yeah, it's like... You know, the progress is pretty apparent. Like, until you start to pixel-peep... and look into it. So, uh... So now everybody's like, &quot;OK.&quot; &quot;All right, so next year's Oh, yeah, this is two dogs podcasting. - Aw. Sharing the same mic, unprofessional. Yeah, that other dog should probably... - There's two different mics, too. - What brand mics are those? - Yeah. for some of the stuff he said, - [EMMA] Yeah. took down another Labrador. Golden Retriever destroyed by the woke mob. So, that, I think - I think it's just like... Man. Uh, they're not releasing this nor should they. 'Cause it'd be Will Smith Because now it's I think there's some sort of... process they're going through there's no way to the obvious ways, like AI pornography and things like that. Yeah, but people If they want to do it, There's gonna be people who, uh, if they're not using this technology, - the same ethical - How do you feel, especially - and artist point of view - ? - What's your - yeah, emotional instinct? - [JARVIS] Yeah. I hate it. Like, yeah. I don't... - Just no. - Yeah, it's just... Um... yeah. - This is - without, like, stealing from other people. - That's the whole thing. Because it's all trained on - licensed or legal, it's still hyper-derivative, and it's very different for, like, a human artist to learn from tracing the works - [EMMA] Yeah. on the works of other people and then create something - Yeah. kind of, uh, flooding the market with... very cheap-to-produce AI art, essentially. Yeah. I don't wanna gatekeep but there is this, like... I mean, even the thread that guy just posting all the examples, it's very telling to me, and almost like the audience that is are pretty disrespectful to and seem to think that the only thing from making beautiful illustrations is the technical element, as opposed to half of artistry being, you know, your execution - - [EMMA] Yeah. or literally ideating on something - and then half of it is having an idea and honing it and rebuilding it. And they're acting as though It's like, &quot;Make me a movie, and it's in space, You're like, &quot;Problem is, and that's why my hasn't been published.&quot; Not because I'm not good at or for some reason I wanted to make a movie None of those things matter. It's just, &quot;The only reason I don't is I didn't spend enough or I don't have a copy of Photoshop. That's what's getting in my way.&quot; Nothing makes me than the kind of... uh, guys who'll be like, &quot;I'm an expert AI prompt writer, and I can write the best prompts to make my AI make beautiful images.&quot; Um, &quot;Here's the ways that,&quot; uh... Not like &quot;buy my course,&quot; but... Basically overselling their skills - as an &quot;artist.&quot; They call it, like, &quot;AI artist.&quot; This is the new genre of, uh, smarmy AI bros getting &quot;It hurts, but I had to do it.&quot; You know, Invincible screencap, &quot;AI art,&quot; &quot;actual artists.&quot; &quot;Look what they need And then, &quot;Very ironic you made this post Go to the next slide. It's an animator for Invincible. - Oh my god. - That's funny, dude. &quot;Learn how to color properly, &quot;Not even in your dreams will you be - It's an animator for One Piece. - Oh my god. That's such a weird, like - It kinda says a lot where, like, you have to have drawn it yourself That's what art is about. It's about winning. - Yeah. Also, that - you know, I think I could illustrate That's like... it's just - - It's really simple. - Um... And on purpose, but that's like - I feel like I could've knocked out. Just... I saw a post, uh, this artwork of... &quot;This is my expression, but it's being gatekeeped by the woke left who are afraid to let me create art.&quot; And it's a sketch... a warped, fucked-up looking sketch that's really unpleasant and poorly done, of a anime high-school old-style British dragon. And everything's bad about it. And when somebody asked him, he just replied, like, &quot;It's epic.&quot; - It's an epic win, guys. Yeah. I'm surprised that's not - We will get to - Elon's gonna make a cameo in one of the things - Oh! - to what has been captivating my feed. Um, which is the... Well... how would I describe this? Uh, actually, Do we have the original video? [MADI] What's a piece of trauma [MADI] It has to actually [MADI] My dad abandoned my family [MADI] That is, um, a wife and four kids. [MADI] He abandoned us and then and he got really good. (laughs) [MADI] He, like, blew up. like viral breakdancer. He became in the world. He got on Good and Washington Post wrote and he did all these interviews - I'll show you. 60-year-old breakdancer. [VO] Yes, 60 years old. Amazing. [MADI] This guy wouldn't pay [JORDAN] Look, I can't do that at all. It's... it's not quite [EMMA] Yeah. [EMMA] At least he did something. - [JORDAN] Lazy. [JARVIS] I don't know mine, - Maybe... - Could be about 60, probably. Maybe if my dad made it to 60, Yeah, that's when it unlocks, He gets, like, a passive. It doesn't even matter - What's... (laughing) OK, maybe this is wild. It's better than not doing it. Like, if I found out my dad did b-boy stuff... Or better yet, I stand I could be wacky-wild-crazy. I think if January 6th happened the way it did, but one person was just doing the like kicking the door down, they That's what the viking guy Oh, if he was legitimately cool, - 10% less animosity. And then they just Everyone would go, - This one part was a tiny bit cool.&quot; &quot;This is pretty tight.&quot; That guy that was carrying the flag, if he was spinning it like - I don't know! I'd be there the next year. So, this story - We're gonna go somewhere with this. But, uh... How do you think Madi here is presenting this story? It's... I would say she's being pretty lighthearted - about this traumatic experience. It's a normal TikTok. &quot;It's beautiful. I mean, he didn't wanna pay for He shouldn't be able to move like that.&quot; He's dancing for... That's more than most deadbeat dads do. - Yeah. Again... To this day, don't know mine. Kind of low-key maybe a little bit, uh, doing a few Facebook messages with some people that I met on DNA websites - to kind of maybe figure out maybe just a little bit who maybe my dad possibly is. - Just to see. I don't care. - Oh. It's Will Smith eating spaghetti! - He's spinning on his head! He rides in on spaghetti - (all laughing) - Yeah, he has spaghetti come under him. Um... - OK. And Jacob, you know Madi, right? - Aw. - [JACOB] Yeah, she's a wonderful person. [JACOB] She's a comedian. She's on TikTok. - Yeah. when Jacob was like, I was like, &quot;There you go. - Dark horse. is &quot;ha ha, that's hilarious, It's a classic comedy thing, like, &quot;Let me take something that is - and let me make it a funny thing.&quot; - OK, so he responded. Oh, and did he respond. The phone is spinning around, - Oh my god, look at him. I'm gonna read the, um... his response. For the audio listeners. &quot;I wake up at 6:00 a.m. to find that my daughter has posted She's a big social media influencer Here it is.&quot; Now, can we go to Madi's TikTok? Like, how many followers does she have? - [JACOB] She has... is a lot of followers. But this man is presenting it Kylie Jenner, like, - siccing her... siccing her fucking - Millions of followers. - It is OK to not have millions, you know? But it's also OK to be honest - in your posts. - And so then he did, uh - If you don't want people to talk - Valid. - Yeah, exactly. Cringe. - Dancing is for girls, OK? We know that. - Oh, that's cute. - is him and his new wife? That's crazy. This is his video. - Now, it's long. - (laughing) Dude, that shirt rules. - from Spy Kids. - [EMMA] Oh, that's sick. crypto-bro Patrick Stewart. High-neck, crew-neck T-shirt, under... the Dan Flashes-style bitcoin shirt. - Shoutout to Anastasia for that joke. for Dan Flashes, I... (laughing) and his chair is so low. - This is a dad chair. He probably spends This is how I wanna - when I play video games. And I haven't been able to So we may clown you a little bit, Ben, but if you can hit me up - I'll take it all back. - He can schmoove. [EMMA] Better than me. [BEN] OK, I wake up I get my coffee, I sit down, and what am I greeted with? [BEN] Well, hundreds of comments Anybody else not expect that voice at all? I did not. Did not expect that. &quot;Oh, goodness, I woke up today&quot; - - Yeah. Yeah, but that's typically what - Those are the rules. He could be from anywhere, - Yeah. - He doesn't need a hat or anything. Just polish that shit. [BEN] Well, after a few I discover that my daughter, This is the nerdiest - This is wild, dude. - &quot;Actually...&quot; Um, &quot;My...&quot; &quot;So, I...&quot; It's like a Ben Shapiro, like... - [EMMA] Yeah. - &quot;She tried to pwn me online.&quot; I was greeted with hundreds of comments.&quot; Dude, the timeline where Ben Shapiro just - Is a breakdancer? - So much better. - That's true. He's little. - Low center of gravity, yeah. - &quot;I love Sad Boyz. I tune in every week.&quot; [BEN] She's also a big social media - [JARVIS] Lie. [BEN] And this video has [BEN] One million likes, 20,000 comments, Shoutout to my, um... Uh, shoutout to my screen-reader users. This man is going full screen-reader mode, - Oh, it's 10 fucking minutes? - I don't think we can watch it all. Also, shoutout to such a, like... &quot;And this many bookmarks!&quot; Yeah. What if the rest of the 10 minutes - was him listing other analytics? &quot;100 million impressions!&quot; &quot;And her next video had &quot;And I'm glad, and I love her.&quot; Oh, OK, tight. But he is upset. And he type you doubt. that she just made it up entirely, and that was just some guy So, in this video, he does not deny - what she alleges in the video. Is that what it is? - Yeah! - Like... - &quot;My kid sucks.&quot; &quot;Maybe if you followed in my footsteps, - Yeah, instead of that Hollywood bullshit. less impressive things that guys have - Like, to become a is, like, less impressive. When I called my dad and he told me I should join the CIA. Uh, wow. That's the second step - to being internet famous? You know, &quot;Hey, this is a thing now, Um, &quot;'Cause people are probably 'Cause that's life. And I'm like, &quot;Yeah, you know, on the internet now.&quot; He was like, &quot;OK. - I'm like, &quot;OK.&quot; - [EMMA] No. Yeah. He wished he was, but no. That's a certain generation of guy as well. - It's like - He really... Like, if you talked to him, And I think he just really, like, he just - fantasized about it all the time. - Kinda. He just kind of - yeah, that's Jersey. - &quot;Oh, I'm gonna...&quot; random military shit all over the basement - and weird propaganda. It was very concerning. - That's like super Reddit guys. was his hyperfixation. I wonder which parent Um, and yeah, it was... If you talked to him, you would've thought But he, uh... He was just an attorney. - One of those CIA guys that - - Yeah. It was like one step away. - You know, um - this is so off-topic. You know there's a thing for baseball fans where you can go roleplay as a Yankee - and do spring training? - Yeah. - You get a little uniform and everything. I saw recently, uh, there was a... I think it was maybe It was some basketball... Some, like, NBA court. But it was a bunch of rich businessmen rented it out to play their This is LARPing. - This is just LARPing. Foam swords, the whole deal. - I would do that too, if I could, I guess? But it's just so funny to see the, um, Morgan Stanley executives or whatever - One of those guys buys a to-scale X-wing, and he's like, &quot;No, it's memorabilia. - You can just like Star Wars. That's OK. You're not gonna get in trouble. He has these signed baseballs, They were worth nothing, you know? - I don't even know where they ended up. Yankee Fantasy Camp. You can't call it &quot;camp&quot; - It stops being camp. It's an outing. - while he was doing this. maybe I would, maybe just a little bit, - like to go to a camp as an adult. - But that's hilarious. Uh, you can go to Army camp as well. Can - I - 100% you can. - I don't know. - It's weird - - Hell yeah. - [EMMA] That'd be cool. - It's a lot of work. No, it's like getting a driving test, where it's more lenient - Oh, yeah, they're just like, &quot;Take it.&quot; where you would go to a camp for it? No. - [JORDAN] Never? You said that fashion design was Yeah, as a five-year-old. I wanted to be a fashion designer, I put that on my &quot;student of and that my favorite color was black, &quot;Hey, she's five and in Catholic school. What the hell is this about?&quot; - I feel like that's on-brand. Yeah, and then I still ended up goth, But that's cool, 'cause you... It's, like, cool to find yourself Yeah. At least, like... You know, I find a lot if they saw me right now, Like, I did everything that child me - wanted me to do and become. - That's nice. little emo bitch, and it - &quot;I wanted to be in Nevada.&quot; One of my yearbooks that I have it says, &quot;I'm sure I'll see you - [EMMA] Oh, wow. - Like, 'cause I... Yeah, it was weird. Oh, and they also said, &quot;Doing something related to - Also a thing they said. Yeah, it was very on-point. - Uh, shoutout to Helen. Uh, I think she finished Uh, and maybe she also has Dude, they might've implemented it now - We should see what else she can predict. - Yeah. - Yeah. Um... who was coming back Oh, Patrick Stewart? Yeah, I can't even remember. - It's all blending together. - but I couldn't remember the details. what's his counter? - &quot;Don't call me a deadbeat?&quot; If we jump ahead? [BEN] ...watched this video. [BEN] And frankly, I was pretty - This guy rules. - &quot;Frankly.&quot; - Yeah. He talks like Dave Chappelle's Do you think he's putting it on, You know how normal people - so they start acting all weird? You know? Or you think I mean, he's gotta... do fake AAVE sometimes, - at some point in his b-boy career. and he's definitely said &quot;my soul brother.&quot; - Yeah. - &quot;What's tracking, brother-cousin?&quot; - Brother-man. [BEN] But honestly, the more I like it. [BEN] Well, I like about 98% of it. [BEN] However, I do need to correct I would like to correct - like, by, like, this - [EMMA &amp; JORDAN] Yeah. but I can already tell the hyperbole, or the sort of half-truths And she wasn't even... She didn't give a lot of detail. She wasn't, like... - She wasn't like, &quot;Fuck my dad.&quot; She said, &quot;I...&quot; you know... - &quot;This guy's weird.&quot; And he is! - It doesn't matter who you are - - She didn't say he sucked. - [JACOB] She said, &quot;Be nice to him.&quot; She said, &quot;He shouldn't be able That's so funny. I'm imagining a world everyone thinks he's &quot;I've got another conference. Like, &quot;Who are you meeting up with?&quot; - That's a movie. - he's spinning on his head. He gets up; he takes a deep breath after, - like, of relief. - &quot;I'm glad I got caught.&quot; where they're like, &quot;KEEP SPINNING! They're slapping him. Um, all right, let's see. [BEN] First, let's just watch and then I'll give you my comments. [JARVIS] OK, we can skip past that. - This right here is a wholesome video. This is what he should've released. - and going, &quot;Aww.&quot; - And then maybe a little bit of - - But no. Or apologize for that. I don't know what the bag is you get from - [BEN] That is a nice shirt. [MADI] You know, I'll get texts - and links to his breakdancing videos. - (Jordan laughing) Legend. I like him. [BEN] OK, in many ways, I love this video. [BEN] And of course, [BEN] And we get along great - - [BEN] But a few corrections are in order. vibe of, like, a Bill Nye Yeah. &quot;Here's why I left my family. &quot;The mitochondria - &quot;And I love my daughter.&quot; &quot;I miss my son!&quot; [BEN] ...that need to be put in context. [BEN] First, I can see that, Madi would see her dad [BEN] One day I was living there; [BEN] And that will look like [BEN] But married couples do get divorced and I was just living a mile or so [BEN] We just weren't living [BEN] Now, about not paying medical bills, that's just not correct. [BEN] Here was the financial [BEN] Madi's mom, my ex-wife, - out of the gate, a lump-sum payment. [BEN] Plus, I was paying her in child support and alimony. - [JORDAN] There's something missing. [BEN] And, of course, I paid health [BEN] I also put $600,000 - [EMMA] How much money do you have? He just dropped, &quot;Yeah, I paid the medical bills. Like, &quot;Uh, huh? What happened?&quot; - [JORDAN] That's the bitcoin. Well, there's a lot of stuff Uh, like I don't know the truth, but the... The stuff that he did was like... allegedly court-ordered, and not like... stuff he was doing out of - Uh... pre-ordained situation, right? - It's required. You can't get out of it. that's just giving someone money. And if your five-year-old kid... If you're a mile away from your then what is the difference from being one You can live in the same house - If you're dodging around. If my child thought maybe call them and have a conversation, (as Ben) &quot;Maybe they Validate their feelings, try to I feel like he's &quot;um, actually&quot;-ing, &quot;Thank you, sir; - You know? that I abandoned her, when I'm now sucked in, and I do but for the podcast we definitely [BEN] ...ex-wife to cover costs [BEN] And this is in 2005 dollars, [BEN] In other words, - [BEN] And by the way - [BEN] But a lot of the comments Why don't men get lip filler? (Jacob &amp; Jarvis laughing) Yeah, he looks like - Will Smith eating spaghetti. - [JARVIS] Yeah. with something or other. - Maybe do an outreach program? - &quot;Help me.&quot; I'm not gonna speak on that. Not me. I had to inject this shit. - Hey, and that's valid. how much I was paying, [BEN] This wasn't something I talked about. [BEN] Also, remember that I was living in La Grange, Illinois. [BEN] Sidewalks all the way. [BEN] An easy walk or bike ride. - He really is saying it! So, walk over. And see your kid. - No, your five-year-old should walk over. - &quot;My kid should commute to her father.&quot; they should make the effort.&quot; Could you ride a bike - That seems illegal, right? - Unsupervised. I would assume something - &quot;I hope someone's watching that child.&quot; Yeah, dude. And probably with turns. - It's not, like, a mile, direct. You can't see him. [BEN] ...No abandonment. Just a divorce. [BEN] Was I at fault in the divorce? [BEN] Yeah, I would say [BEN] I own that. [BEN] Madi's mom and I were really [BEN] We were compatible in [BEN] Do I regret marrying Madi's mom? - [BEN] No, absolutely not. [JORDAN] (laughing) &quot;Yeah, [BEN] ...would not have been born. [BEN] The kids have turned out great. I know he's saying that because but it sounds like he's gonna murder them. - &quot;They wouldn't have lasted.&quot; - about, like, what he has to do. where he pulls out the gun. - &quot;These are mags.&quot; - (mimicking gun cocking) - (as MoistCr1TiKaL) &quot;What's up, guys?&quot; &quot;There's a viral video going around &quot;I would click my fingers &quot;I'm an excellent b-boy.&quot; - Charlie should - (laughing) - Charlie should pivot. I feel like that would create - For real. The cuts on this are so funny to me. I like that he edited it, though. Yeah. It's just like - - Yeah, it is still 10 minutes long. As a video editor myself, &quot;And I definitely (all laughing) &quot;Madi has become very successful!&quot; &quot;Do I regret my wife?&quot; &quot;No. Of course not.&quot; &quot;We were two very different people.&quot; Yeah, it looks like he's having Yeah, he's doing - He's doing old-school YouTube joke cuts. - Jenna Marbles, yeah. Yeah. &quot;Erm, so then they said this,&quot; &quot;What the hell's going on here?&quot; You guys ever seen that video - Johnny Depp and 'cause they tried to get All right, I gotta know more Ben Hardman? &quot;Ben Hart, man.&quot; I gotta know [BEN] One other slight correction, which I hesitate to even bring up, because I love the way [BEN] I did not abandon [BEN] I have a career. [BEN] Built an ad agency. [BEN] That's how I was able to afford [JORDAN] &quot;Sorry; guys, - I left you to do advertising.&quot; - &quot;I'm not like a bad guy.&quot; &quot;I saw Mad Men, That'll be me, actually.'&quot; - &quot;I miss the '50s.&quot; he thinks that he's in Mad Men. Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, bitcoin guys are that. - That is the contemporary - They post, you know, images of uh, Don Draper, and it's like, &quot;These are what men were,&quot; - miserable people traumatized from war. a very loud piece of... like, clothing, like a statement piece, but have no swag to it at all. So it's just like an extremely strange - Like, it's a Dan Flashes shirt, dad jeans and those, uh, - those big white Reeboks or whatever. [JORDAN] Sat in his truck. - that also did b-boying. Uh, he's driven around, [BEN] ...separated in 2004 [BEN] I took up breakdancing as a way to get in shape at the age of 54. - &quot;By accident.&quot; (laughing) He kept falling over &quot;I slipped, and someone said, &quot;Oops!&quot; [BEN] ...might be wondering, &quot;Can he still breakdance at age 66?&quot; [BEN] Well, I don't know. - [EMMA] Shut the fuck up. - Not the bitcoin flag, what the fuck? Oh, this rocks. And the rest of the video is this. - (Jordan laughing) I am not. Jacob, (all laughing hysterically) - That's awesome! - What a legend! that it's never too late - [BEN] I started when I was age 54. - [EMMA] That's a beautiful message. for anyone not to be breakdancing. - (Jordan losing it) Guys, I know what - I know how we're spending our day. We're ending the podcast on the Patreon. - Yeah, our bitcoin flag. We unfurl it. - (Emma and Jordan laughing) (all laughing) Not &quot;there's no reason Specifically, &quot;Start...&quot; (laughing) What the fuck?! - How long was he dancing? - That's crazy. - Oh my god. Just playing Aphex Twin after telling your daughter - Yeah. - I just left. Dumbass.&quot; What's the problem?&quot; &quot;Actually, a deadbeat dad &quot;Watch this.&quot; (laughing) &quot;Check this shit out.&quot; Oh, fuck, dude. like those guys on Twitter, where if you're mean to them &quot;Um, I actually have - so who's the loser now?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, you think Check this out.&quot; - Whirlwinds for five minutes. I obviously would love - [EMMA] Mmhmm. about the people who have - Yeah. He should've - I mean, I guess but I feel like there's a wealth level - Come on, man. - [JARVIS] Yeah. I love this guy. I apologize that they had to go, you know, feel abandoned, feel unsupported. But at the same time, - I know. It's gonna get worse. - Ooh! Gets his baseball hat? Gets his flag. - It's the bitcoin. - Have you watched this? - stay around to watch this. - You're totally real for that. Oh, yeah, so she replied. - Is she wearing his hat? I know. Yeah. Yeah. Aw.
