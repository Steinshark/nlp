Are one pot meals even any good? Let's talk about that Good Mythical Morning. Time is money and dishes are time. So by the transitive property, And I don't want to spend my money on Okay, let me see if I can translate that. I think what he's saying is, should you really bother spending all the style meal if a one pot version Yeah, what I said it's time for. You can't spell that's delish without dishes or candy. Okay, boys. In front of Rhett is a one pot chicken On Link's side is the same dish, And no, the crew didn't just forget to clean Because those are the very dishes it in front of you. Mine was from a Dutch oven Here's your one pot. Look at that one pot. All you gotta do is just I thought a Dutch oven was like a... A move. It was like a fart thing I think it's a bed fart. Is that a Dutch oven? Yeah, I think it is. It can be both. It's both things. This one does not use... So, Nicole, you farted on this? Yeah. Can you smell it? Oh, God. I'm sorry I brought it up. So your job, this whole game is to determine if the separated dishes are so much better than the traditional or if the one pot version suffices. So at the end you'll say worth the time or one pot's fine. And this is the same ingredients? Yep. Same ingredients, yeah. I love the fact that the rice of this one. Chicken and rice, bro. What is this called? That's all it's called? He hasn't been around the No, but I mean, it doesn't have more of a Chicken and rice with red stuff. Chicken and rice with sun right? Chicken and rice with sun dried tomatoes. Oh, I didn't know if there was more of a name for it. The fact that this rice matured in the context of a sauce, it's gonna be tough to beat. Now, the chicken itself. you might call it dry. It's a little. It's a little overcooked. Just a little bit. But it was in the pot. How could you know? Exactly, right? What am I A fortune teller? Right. Yeah. No. Now this one right here, that's pumpkin. You would definitely need to know because I'm sitting That chicken, it cut real nice. That chicken is so good. But the rice doesn't look good. The rice. Mm. Mm. Like I'm gonna have to into my rice. The chicken is so much better... According to the writers, in the 14 minutes that it takes Just so we can understand what 14 minutes is. Yeah, put it into perspective for us. In that time. We could also go halfway through Okay, that makes sense for us locals. We could listen to I'm Yours by Jason Oh, that half time would be hard for me. I need to finish it every time. Okay. I kind of want to clean instead. Or... Rhett and Link could and then take a 12 minute nap. Hey, efficiency, son! If you know what you're doing, don't take long. This rice is so good. The rice is so good. But the chicken's so good over here. What do we do? Well, chicken comes first in the dish. I think it's the star, but. And I just think that... rice is rice. Come on. Chicken. Rice is not. You're gonna have to go through a You like that? I would just like to maybe chop Chicken's a lot better. It's so much better. And the rice is not bad. It's just if you didn't you would be like, And what do I do in the That's the only service that I offer. Okay, this is gonna skew a lot of the results... because most people are thinking that I'm actually disagreeing with you. Cause I'm going with the one pot. I love that rice so much. How does this game work? Can we disagree? Well, no, you can't. You have to come to an agreement. But the chicken is better over here. But you just said you prefer to clean. I'm trying to come up with reasons. I think that makes your whole... perspective invalid. Cleaning is taking time to clean in the people would like to avoid. So I think we're trying to do that. But when the rice is that good, it's just a shame. But I'll agree with you. This isn't bad rice. It's just not as good. So we are saying it's worth the time to get the chicken out of your mind or in your I t's worth the time to make If this was a chicken thigh. it might have fared a little bit better. You know what I'm saying? There we go. Sorry. I know that hurts you. Cause I'm so strong. I'm not sensitive. Okay. On Rhett's side is a one And on Link's side is a And we only made one But the hamburger casserole So if you wanna make up you gotta keep that in et cetera. Is there tomato in that skillet? No tomato in that, but there is... I'm voting for that one. Come on. Well, how did you get the surface of the It's called an oven. Cheese, baby. It's called cheese. Colby Jack and cheddar. I mean, You know, you're going to be telling stories How did you get. How did you get that brewing setting? I don't know. It kind of looks like a burnt human. It's amazing how amazed you are by just kitchen creations. As many as you've eaten. Have you really never been in I value the work of our team. Okay. I like to eat the work of our team. I like it when you talk about our team. Keep doing it. Can I use a spoon? This is a good fried burger. Spoon. So this is intriguing. It's gonna be tough to beat a burger, but. Oh, burgers are the best. Is that pasta? Unless there's fried chicken there. And then I'm like, what? Look at that. That's like a Hamburger Helper. Give me some of that. Well, no. Cause you don't. You wanna get some of the top? You wanna get some of the top. Yeah. I'm gonna break it next to yours here. I gotta. Woo. This is a big bite, but it's soft and silent. Watch your mouth. What? It's gonna burn. Well, here. I. Watch your mouth. You watch my mouth. I can't watch my own mouth. I don't wanna look at Oh, it's hot. I just stained my. Just stained my pants... I'll tell you, this is a hard job. This is a lot like that thing we with our other two roommates. It's more. What's the sauce in here? So it's a cream of mushroom soup base. Really? Yeah. But there's mustard in it. You taste mustard? I mean, like, but I wouldn't say it's like an aggressive amount of mustard. Is it aggressive for you? Oh, yeah. It's just enough. Very nice. I like it quite a bit. Maybe it's chili. It reminds you of chili. You said? Does it have some cumin? Is there some chili in there? There's a little bit of spices. Yeah. It's really good. But it's no hamburger. It ain't. It's not a cheeseburger. It's in no way a cheeseburger. I just don't think a casserole I know. And I... don't get me wrong. As much as I appreciate this. Now hold on. We need to take into account the fact that it takes 11 minutes to Okay. Let me put that in perspective. Versus just that one skillet. In 11 minutes, you could watch the entirety of U2's You could watch 11 minutes of Ocean's 11. Or... Rhett or Link could make then take a nine minute nap. still only takes two minutes for us. Yep. Yep. I mean, so is that one minute each? Sure is. It's really hard to choose the burger when the alternative is make love for two minutes That's not what's on the table, brother. Is that. Are those moms? No, no, no, no, no. Cause I am. I am eating it up. I think you're mixing Um, no, it's not better than a burger. It's really good. I respect it. It would be a nice change of pace, It is not. It is worth. It is worth the time. It is worth the time to make a burger. Worth the time. To make your burger. And clean. To make that burger mine. You put on a beanie. I did. It says box stuffing on it. Isn't that funny? And isn't it like... Seasonal Kind of holiday seasonal, Yeah. That's because this is the Yep. Holiday season beanies, including spiced nuts. And box stuffing. If you like your nuts spiced, What do you call this? Ball. Pom Pom. Pom pom. And if you like your stuffing boxed, Mm. Go to the Mythical store and check it out. You'd be surprised What we got, Stevie? You'd be surprised. Well, because that's what it looks like, and that's what you're You'll be pleasantly surprised. Rhett, and link, Okay, so the whole thing is just Just put it on the sheet pan... And I can see this is where Oh, you want some of that? Get a hold of that. I know you like that. That stuff. Oh, man. that's greasy looking. You put the whole thing The whole thing. So a little scrimps. A little scrimp, and then a nice little quarter. A little quarter zucchini. What made this happen? The Internet? Yeah. One pan and one pot This is. This is a Food Network recipe, is it not? Is this Food Network? Yeah, it's Food Network. Bread's not bad. How do you know that? I read it off the cheat sheet. Oh... About to. Say you're doing your homework. I mean, that bread doesn't look but it tastes really good. Especially that part. The shrimps taste fine. Yeah, it's good... I kind of like my zucchini a little bit burnt. Did you have to make the zucchini smaller Because these are much bigger zucchinis. I was just going off of, like, a. Like, the recipe and the photos so There's no, real, culinarial, reason for it. Why would you say... that this zucchini and shrimp tastes better when you made them separately? Because I believe they do, don't you? Why do I say? I think it's because you can control the I think whenever you throw you're kind of leaving it up to, the grand oven of it all. The flavor on that zucchini is incredible. I've never said that about zucchini. It is so much better. It's weird. So we're liking this one, but it takes 12 minutes to clean all this crap. And, they've helped us understand forgotten since two rounds ago. In 12 minutes, you could watch a vine compilation Remember that? If you're not into that, you could get to the fourth day And if you're not into that, you could watch us make love to our wives and then take a 10 minute nap. Yeah, right. So... Choose your poison. You know. I will say that this is the best flavored zucchini I've ever had. Best ever. But I've never watched myself make love. You don't have a mirror? Okay, yeah, I guess I have. You ever made eye contact with yourself? Not in video form. Yeah, don't make it last. When you do. don't make eye contact with yourself Which, of course, you do. Well, I don't have one in my bedroom. I'm talking about maybe like a hotel. I don't have, a mirror on the ceiling or anything. I'm thinking about getting one. You don't have one on the wall, though? I have one on the wall. Not in view of the bed. Do I need one? Let me think about that for a while. And windows. I'm sorry, but once again. It's always good to look out a window. Once again, it's worth the time... to get the shrimp and the stuff Yeah. I mean, what? It's just too much better. Are we just crapping all over this trend? Is that what's happening? It's too much better. It's Food Network. They canceled our show anyway. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Scrum Scrum! So we are saying. We already said it. Worth the. Oh. And it was down there. Yeah. Put it back. Did you see it? All right. Worth the time. I missed it. If I may, Stevie, my expectations have been obliterated here today so far. You thought you might I really thought I was gonna be one I like things mushier. Yes, I like to clean dishes, but I don't want to clean more dishes. You've got other hobbies. Yeah, so... That are better. I can still clean one dish and But we haven't chosen it yet. What? What? Maybe this round will change it up. What are we dealing with here, Stevie? Yeah, looking like maybe not Because you have what is on your side, Rhett. And then, you just have a traditional funfetti cake. Whoops. Ooh. Link, this has got pudding in it. That didn't work. He might like this. Cause he doesn't like Oh, gosh. He also. He doesn't like cake so much. He's not familiar with how to handle it. It's teetering on this... This blunt knife. We got one pot and we Sense a pattern? This is. This is dump cake, not cake. Okay. I think it's a cake. There's Funfetti cake, vanilla pudding, That's a cake. That's pretty cool. Why is that a cake, Nicole? Well, but like, it's just. What do you mean? It's baked. She knows it's not cake. So much pudding. Well, cakes can have pudding. I think it's fair, Stevie. This is the best cake I've ever had. That's really, really good. That's really good. You know why this cake is so good? Cause it gets rid of any Yeah, they, like, seep into each other. They marry. There is a cake part, When you replace cake with pudding. I'm at your place. I'm showing up, I'm RSVPing. I do like cake, though. Okay, but like, let's say you're throwing a birthday actually want a Funfetti cake. And then you bring. Those people are not worth celebrating. Then you bring the dump cake. You're like, here's the cake. But those people aren't. Maybe not here right now. No, this is a good cake. This is a really good cake. But it's still a cake. But it takes a long time to clean up It takes the longest time that it's taken. Anything to take. It takes 17 minutes. Whoa. Let me put that into perspective. In 17 minutes, you could become a You could pet a dog How long? 17 minutes. That's nice. Or... you could watch me or Link make love to That's almost a power nap. Yep. And if you yell, hurry up, It might be 16 minutes. Then we'll give you more of a power nap. If I was looking at myself in the mirror, go faster. You back. You backed yourself into that one. I could tell you didn't know... the ramifications. I didn't know I was gonna and I didn't want to last So you got more aroused I got more aroused looking at myself. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. I would have a short too. A short fuse. I'm not angry. Okay. Now, you know that I love this. And that it's superior to me... and it's less time to clean. It's a pleasant surprise as an Oh, yeah. I think you gotta bring So it's worth the time to make both. Just say it's vegan. Even if it's not. That's what I always I brought the vegan version. Yeah, it's vegan. I want somebody to eat it. Even if it's just vegans. It's so good. It's the thought that counts. Right. I intended it to be vegan. I think it might be vegan. And I do think. Are you with me on this? That. Yeah, I'll go with you on this. One pot's fine. One pot's fine for this. Can you believe it? They made cake into a casserole I legitimately recommend you do this. But I will say... But don't watch me make love. This is the one thing that I didn't but... I just think we obliterated this trend. I think you need to I think if you're going to make a plate of foods, Just do it.
