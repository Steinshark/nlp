Hello everyone, I'm Dawen. Today, I'm in a residential area in Xi'an. It's 7:00 in the morning now. The main road next to the residential area is already bustling with traffic. Busy vendors, rushing office workers, and residents who wake up early to buy fresh meat and vegetables all contribute to the lively atmosphere of the city. Here, a group of people is rushing to buy freshly arrived honey tangerines. This is a hybrid fruit variety. It looks a bit like a pear, with thin skin that's easy to peel. The flesh is tender, juicy, and pleasantly sweet and sour. These are sea bass, they look very fresh too. Various cooking sauces are abundant. Let's see what breakfast this stall is making? It turns out to be an oversized pan-fried chive dumpling. The temporary breakfast stalls by the roadside are indeed convenient. &quot;Come, have a taste.&quot; &quot;What is this?&quot; &quot;Five-grain corn stick, the kind we used to eat as kids.&quot; &quot;It's crispy and crunchy.&quot; &quot;Five-grain corn stick.&quot; &quot;Five-grain corn stick.&quot; These are tofu rolls. &quot;Three for five yuan.&quot; Here is a vendor making fresh millet sticks. The aroma is really enticing. I used to buy snacks like this often when I was in primary school. They're fragrant and crispy, melting in the mouth. The main ingredient is yellow millet. Are these sesame oil? Yes, sesame oil. Freshly ground sesame paste, with a strong aroma. Local residents are all taking the opportunity to buy fresh fruits. It's now 7:30 in the morning. The morning market in this residential area is getting more crowded. Xi'an is truly deserving of its title as the &quot;Carbohydrate Capital&quot;. There are various types of noodles everywhere. These are &quot;Wosun&quot; (Chinese Lettuce). They're great for stir-frying with beef, very tasty. This vendor pushing a bicycle is selling a traditional Chinese maltose, which is said to have a cough-relieving effect. These are dried tofu. In Xi'an, only freshly made foods are competitive. Pre-made foods are not very popular. Look, all these chili powders are freshly ground. These are various traditional biscuits of Xi'an. &quot;I want wife cake.&quot; &quot;How many?&quot; &quot;Eight.&quot; &quot;Y=8.5.&quot; These are broken vermicelli, so they're very cheap. Yin Lai Fu Jin Ju Min Feng Kuang Qiang Gou In such a morning market, the stall owners have to stand high and shout loudly to attract more customers' attention. The middle section of this street has the highest flow of people. Because this morning market is open for a limited time, it must close by 8:30. If you want to buy the freshest fruits, you must wake up early and run fast to get here on time. Look at this morning market, it's crowded and difficult to move. In this bustling section, I found a very popular food area. &quot;Is this spicy soup?&quot; &quot;It's spicy soup with tofu pudding.&quot; &quot;A mix.&quot; This stall makes Chinese hamburgers with vegetable filling. &quot;Are all these fillings self-service?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Is this chili spicy?&quot; &quot;I don't know, it's my first time trying it.&quot; The fillings here are all self-service.

Xi'an locals have very high demands for the freshness of ingredients. Even various spices must be freshly ground. This Xinjiang guy is making baked pancakes. These pancakes are really fragrant. I continued to turn right into a narrow street. The congestion level of this street shocked me. There's a vendor here promoting various kitchenware. The vendor says all the goods are priced at Y=1. There's a shop selling scallion pancake in front. Each shop has its own unique way of making them. &quot;Original price Y=100+, frying pans now all Y=49.&quot; There's an old stall owner repairing shoes here. There's a vendor here making egg rolls.

The bustling streets of the morning market just now have suddenly returned to tranquility. All the vendors have closed up shop. After exploring the morning market under the high-rise, I entered a bird market next to the morning market. The colorful parrots are beautiful and cute. Look, are they a couple?
