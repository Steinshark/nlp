somber country [Peter] All right, Titus. Going on a mission, [Titus] Yes. -Show us the route. So... [Peter] Here's Liberty. [Titus] Yep. So we're gonna go South on 127 and then we're gonna go west till we get to Bowling Green. -Okay. -And then we're going south on 65, -How long do you think, Titus? -Well if we had a ride straight through it would be just under and so God is calling us to go. So he'll provide the transportation and we'll just see who he sends that really needs to hear about Jesus, -Oh, you're bringing the Bibles? Maybe we'll meet somebody We can give them a Bible and... -How long do you think it will take us? -That's in God's hands. -Ran out of space, Titus? -Yeah, I didn't space things very well. -&quot;Nashvill&quot;. [both laughing] [Titus] Oh, no. [Peter] That works. All right, hopefully -Yes. [Titus] This first, maybe two miles or so, We may have a little bit -Titus, I haven't hitchhiked since -Wow, so you're excited? -I'm super excited, [tractor approaching] Here we go, Titus, we have a tractor. Do you think it'll pick us up? [tractor drowns out giggling] [Peter] All right, here we go... we're in. All right, Thank you. We're going to Nashville. [tractor drowns out farmer] -[Peter] Thank you. All right, nice. [both giggling] [Titus] Life, for many people but when you're stepping out in faith life will always be And I don't have a worry in my mind because I know He's gonna provide He'll provide everything we need. [Titus] The dark purple ones I guess because they're so tough, This one here is called chicory, and it has a root that can be and it can be brewed -Yeah Titus, this road is quiet. -It is, yeah. [crows cawing] [Peter] Hear the crows? Going down this road for about 45 minutes. Not one car has passed. [Titus] We're getting close to where [truck approaching] [Peter] Oh, yeah. [Peter] How you doing? Don't go out of your way. -We're heading that way, [Peter] Thank you. [Peter] There we go. -This thing sounds mean. -[Peter] Yeah. Oh yeah. [truck accelerates] upbeat country -Ladies, you guys are awesome. -I love your driving style. -You got a heavy foot. -Did you modify this? -I modified it, but no, but if you want to, we can take you. -Maybe you can -Maybe. [all giggling] [engine revving and tires squealing] [both laughing] [Titus] Wow. [Peter] She was proud -I'm just gonna use the restroom, Titus. -You gonna stay out here? -I'll just push this cart. -You're returning the cart? -That's nice of you, Titus. -Might as well. -When's the last time -Probably when I was maybe 17. -17-years-old? -You're looking for Titus? [woman] ...they're from Florida I was telling them how he lived and stuff. He's really become a celebrity. -My niece is Jerry Roberts and Sherry. -She's my sister, and you was talking and she come running out, She's about 12 or 13. -We're going to preach in Nashville. -Oh, are you? -You're both hitchhiking? [Peter] We've done well so far. -I know Titus did but I didn't know [Peter] Yeah. [Titus] He's adventurous, [Peter] Gotta say -Yes. -Two vehicles passed us, two rides. -Yeah. -Now this is the true test, the main road. -Yep. [truck speeds past] -I've had people pass me and they'll &quot;I just passed you up &quot;I had to turn around and pick you up.&quot; Had that happen numerous times. -Any crazy stuff ever happen, Titus? Any bad experiences? -No, I've never had any bad experiences. -I did ride with one guy and he didn't say anything out of line, but I just had this bad feeling -Yeah. [truck passes] [Titus] I don't mind riding in the back. [Peter] You know of Titus? -Yeah, for years. [Peter] All right. -Thanks for picking us up. -Well this is cool, unexpected... [Peter] He's a character, huh? -He is that. That's for sure. -He's going down, he's going under. -The AC's a little stronger back there. -So people really know him well -Yeah, I've known him for years too. I've known their family for... -So you grew up here? -Yeah, just down the road. -How do you like Casey County? -I really... I haven't been but I really love it here. There's a lot of family here, I could be happy wherever there's family. People are friendly here, I like it here. -They are, everyone is super nice. -Yeah, you travel a lot. How is it compared to other places? -It's really friendly, I knew nothing -Oh yeah? -Okay, that's funny, I've actually That's pretty much the only... -Very nice people, -It is. -I see what you're talking about, I'm enjoying my time more than cities these days. -I was watching the Appalachian series, From what I tell people, unless you've lived here if you're in this area There's not a lot of reason -There's not a whole lot here. -Church is a big thing out in these parts? -Almost everyone goes to a church. We don't all go to the same church but I would say definitely in a minority There are a lot of very conservative, there's a lot of different variations, they're all very conservative though. -So you were saying Kieth, you saw -Yeah. -You were saying something which I agree with -Yeah. -And most people can't hack it, right? -It has a lot of parts Like you mentioned, you gotta be willing and another big thing is for Titus, And that really, Where when it's time to cut hay his buddies come and he helps his friends too. But it's kind of hard for one person -Right. -So I think community -So you helped build his barn? -Yeah, me and his brother did We hand-dug the footers out for that barn. Which in hindsight, we should have just and it would have still been than to spend two or three days there -Titus didn't want that? How did he say that? &quot;It's a better experience, you know?&quot; &quot;It draws you closer.&quot; Occasionally that's a good thing to do. I would probably go broke -Did your back think -No, it probably was a good thing -All right Keith, appreciate it. -All the best. -Good meeting you. [Kieth] Take these sesame sticks. -Oh... shoot, I like them -There you go. -You have a good trip, man. [Titus laughs] [Peter] Wow. All right, we're out at the main road, -Cumberland Parkway. Going west is... -Cumberland Parkway, -We wanna go west. -This is where it -Yeah, this is where [Peter] You were saying back there sometimes when people they really open up to you, -Yes. -Why do you think that is, because -I'm anonymous, I don't know -I don't know anybody in their family. -So if I would say something it's not gonna go back [Peter] What's the sign say up there? -&quot;Prohibited, pedestrians, -Tituses? -Would that sign -No, I've walked on the shoulder. I've had sheriffs tell me, &quot;You're not allowed They pick me up or I've had a state trooper and he never said a word about it. He's just like, He's like, &quot;I radioed ahead to my buddies they can give you a ride.&quot; But then I've had &quot;Oh, you're not allowed to do this.&quot; and I got arrested when I was walking They put me in jail there, -Really, for hitchhiking? -Well they didn't say... I wasn't... They didn't charge me with hitchhiking. They told me it was illegal and they said that you'll go to a... [truck passes] They said, &quot;You'll have I said I don't want an appointed But when I went to the... I ended up seeing the state-appointed &quot;We decided since we'll drop this case.&quot; So they just let me go. [giggling] -For those that haven't seen we went over that, no driver's license, -Because it burnt up... -Birth certificate -No, birth certificate in a flood. -So zero identification? -What's your identification here, -Yeah, got my Bible in here, -Oh, there we go. [Titus giggles] [Titus] I feel like God's and telling me that We've been waiting here for, -Something like that? -You're feeling it? [truck passes] -What's this here, Titus? -This is a lady that I go dig ginseng with her and with her daughter. We go in the woods together And I was just looking at it, Brings back good memories. We had a great time digging ginseng and... They called it yellowroot, -Sorry, you two were very close? -I wouldn't say real close When I was young. -[Peter] Oh, yeah. -Yeah Titus, we got a ride. -Donald, thank you. -Yep. -I felt like God was telling me and then after I said that, you showed up probably five minutes later. [Peter] Do you pick up -Not a whole lot. [Peter] You got burnt on it? Oh... [Titus] What did they do? -They had dope. What made you pick us up? Me and her started dating She wasn't saved Well, me and her get together, Well, she started going to church. It was her idea to go to church, So we started going to church. About the fourth time -Wow. -And we been continuing and it's going pretty good. -This is your girlfriend? -Oh, wow. So she's saved. What do you mean exactly by that? She went to church four times -She got conviction, she prayed for forgiveness, and she's turned her life around. -Doesn't have addiction problems? Well, she finishes up her clinic, -Oh, yeah. -She been on that for three years, -So she's gonna get off Suboxone? -Off all that, yeah. -And then she was at work... and one of her coworkers was in a bad way, So it's just a snowball effect. -[Titus] Jesus is still changing lives. -So where we're at, here in Kentucky, Fair to say? -No. -Well, religion, yes... Christianity, no. -What religion? [Titus] There's a difference between [Donald] You got a lot of people but you don't have [Titus] Yeah. -What do you mean by that? -Well they're what we call -Christians on Sunday-- -Yeah, and then You know they... They won't do anything to help anybody. -One of Jesus' biggest things was charity. -Okay, gotcha. -They won't do anything to help anybody. So I call them Sunday morning Christians. -You you call yourself -Yeah, 'cause I drove I mean the good lord's put it on me just walk over and hand 'em $20. I do it, it could be -You feel that come through you? -Like a higher power? -This is what Titus Interesting. [Titus] There's no better satisfaction by somebody who knows more than you do. That's something I told Spring, you can't outgive God. [Titus] Yeah, that's true. -You might give your last $5 [Titus] That's right. [Peter] What are your thoughts -About the US at the moment? -What do you mean by that? -I think we're coming into the end times. [Peter] The end times?! [Titus] I definitely agree with you, Don. -Okay, but I was told by some They were saying it then, something's about to happen? Is that what you're saying? -Yeah, it's already happening. -Like we've never in the history for keeping their churches open but we just saw that recently. -We're being lied to by media, by news. There's no truth out there. And if you speak the truth, There's one thing the Bible says, &quot;A liar shall not Why is that? Why would a liar Because he will You can't tell a liar because he believes it himself. [Donald] All right, I'mma take you 'cause that's where most trucks run. [Peter] Oh, do you think... You were a truck driver, are picking up -No, it's against [Titus] I used to... I used to get a lot more rides but now I don't hardly ever -Because a lot of companies have... Well insurance companies because somebody and the hitchhiker sued -[Donald] So now, no riders. -That's too bad. -Because it shows That you pick up a stranger, -You know where the United States Index is probably like nine or ten. -Try 25th. -Okay, but freedom's hard to measure You're living on 50 acres, you're really left alone. -I have to say for me, and still,God is blessed and merciful -Difference between me and him. [Peter] What's that? -Okay... now... I work a job, I make, say, $600 a week... gross. Uncle Sam's gonna take $200 of that. [Peter] You make 600 a week? -That's a rough estimate. -That's tough these days to get by. -So... All right, if you make $600 a week, Uncle Sam takes What's that leave me to live on? -So what are you doing now? -You're a mechanic, right? -And you're only making 600 a week? -Uh... Sometimes a little over that But I mean where's the freedom at? If I've gotta work 80 hours -Donald, can I pray for you? -What can I pray about? -All right. Father in heaven, Thank you for Donald's kindness to us. He went the second mile to take us We're so grateful for that. Father, I pray Give him better health, and draw him I pray you continue giving her freedom You sent Jesus and because of him we have freedom I ask also for Donald that to quit tobacco and give him Break that habit in his life and he could live many more healthy years. We thank you for his kindness We know that you already have In Jesus' name we pray, amen. -[Donald] Amen. -I gave my girlfriend [Peter] There's a bit of gas money. -Thank you, sir. [Titus] The ones that gives the gifts. -That was a beautiful prayer, Titus. -He was a beautiful-- -You condensed everything he said -He's a beautiful person, I just want to see I want to meet him a year from now more healthy, more strong, I want to hear -All right, I'm gonna get some water Titus is asking if we can We need what you're doing, a lot of people [Peter] What are you doing, sir? [man] I pick up garbage. -Home, residence... -Doing pretty decent. I mean I think everybody's... A lot of people are having a hard time Everything's went up so high. I live in Glasgow and started a route. It was like $26 at the landfill, and it more than doubled [Peter] So you're -Well yeah, it makes it rough for... You go up and everybody but you 'bout have to stay in business. -Because all your prices went up, yeah. [Titus] I guess you'll -That's one thing, it's nasty work [Peter] Oh, without you guys, [Titus] You help -Yeah. -Yeah, Titus, you really see I know you're sort of Your overhead is a but for the average person -Yeah, it's getting harder and harder. -Yeah, you can see it and you can feel it that just the wages -I don't think, you know? -I can't believe that mechanic -That's really low. -Yeah. [cars passing] [Peter panting] [Peter] You were saying you think Donald will be very happy -Yeah, just because he's able to express what he's really thinking, or feeling, -Yeah. -Other people can see that -Right. -They can identify what he's going through having so many expenses -So Donald is like your every day man. -Hard-working blue collar-type guy. Has really little voice in society. So he'll be pretty happy -I think so. He was very willing to be on camera. Like he wanted -Yeah, I find that a lot of people I'm not having a hard time getting people to speak out. More want to speak on camera than don't. -That's good. -And I think it's because they feel like Oh, that was the slow down, -Wasn't it? -They're scoping us up and down. He let off the gas pedal, [Peter] Oh, right at the sign. [Titus giggling] [Peter] How you doing, sir? Thank yo so much. [all chuckling] [Peter] We won't knock you in the head. [Peter] So Billy-Roe, you went by us. -I didn't see you, I just looked up and thought [Titus] How long has it been? [Billy] Well probably 15, 20 years [Peter] Billy-Roe, are you from here? -Yeah, I was born in the hospital Except when I went to Western for college. -Okay, what'd you study? -Agriculture. -Gotcha. [Titus] Oh, you a farmer? -Yeah, I actually taught school been there ever since. [Peter] How's farming these days? -Well I'm a dairy farmer right now. I will be for another ten days I guess. We're selling all 360 head of cows. -How do you feel about that? -Well I don't know, of course but I'll be 75 in January. -You drive like you're 16 -You just took off. I'm actually heading Supposed to be there in seven minutes, -With the way you drive, we can get there. No, I don't believe we'll make it. -How far is Bowling Green? -About 65 miles -Oh, we scored, Titus. This is a big ride. [Titus] Yeah. [Peter] At 75, you're saying Life goes quick? From 45 to 75, that just went like a blip? -Yeah, about three weeks you'll be 75. -Oh, wow. So Billy-Roe, what do you think? You've seen a lot, 75 years, What are your thoughts -I think we're in terrible shape, myself. -Yeah? -Did it feel like this before, late '60s? -No? Just hope we can come out of it. -Not even like during Vietnam times? -No sir. Especially when they We lived through segregation. -Yeah. -I went to school when we had two... Our school was segregated. We actually integrated, I remember that. -You remember that? -So when you there were separate bathrooms -Yes, sure was. -And segregated classrooms too? -We had segregated schools. -Wow. We didn't have blacks [Titus] So was there a lot of bullying -No. -Not at all. -Not at our schools. [Titus] So that speaks really well Why would you say Just because -Just a rural area I think, [Titus] So you worked together So you already knew these people? -Yes. But it seemed like the government Or doesn't want us to get along. [Peter] Right. They use all these issues to divide us. -Yes. Sure do. Seems like that to me, I hope I am wrong. We're getting ready to get on 65, guys. [Peter] Oh, wow. -Titus, this takes us to Nashville, right? That's when we can start using the sign. -That's exciting. -[Billy] Got an email? [Billy] Can you send me one [Peter] You want us to let you know -Yeah. -Gonna get off right here. -Be safe out there guys. So Nashville, I just saw a sign. I think we're like 50 miles. [traffic speeding past] Do you feel like your preaching... It's like it's building up inside you -Yeah, like I have more joy Definitely. [traffic speeding past] [Peter giggles] -He was nice. -Officer was nice. -But we have to get off this road. -Because it was a parkway -Now it's an interstate. -Now it's an interstate. -State highways are okay They don't want you -But that's changed, you didn't know that? Oh well. -So we're gonna go up to this road. -This road is going the direction [Titus] Climbing over. -What's God telling us, Titus? Because it all went so smooth -Well, we're gonna 'cause God wants us to go [Peter] Okay, so the new plan There should be an on-ramp to the highway where the cars are going much slower. Where we were was not ideal at all. Cars going 65, 70 miles per hour. Not gonna stop before So... It was almost All the rides came so easily, and then as we get very close 50, 60 miles away to Nashville, it's gotten difficult. [Peter] You just told me off-camera -Yes. The woman that God brought Uh... I wish she could be but I'll see her when we get back. -You get like the tingly feelings, -For sure. -Would she want to go -I think so, yeah. She's done street ministry before. -Oh, okay. I mean this is true street ministry. Like really working for it. -On the front lines. -Yeah, because we got quite a bit -Yep. -All right, guys, The closer we get, the more it feels out of reach. We're gonna get there Titus. I got you a banana. You're feeling it? [man drowned out by traffic] -[Titus] That is so kind of you to stop. -No problem. -[Peter] He was going the other direction. -But he stopped, -He just saw us walking. -That's pretty cool. Yeah, the news reports but there's so many kind-hearted people. -Right, right. So where in the Bible The closer you get to your destination, Is there a proverb? -Hmm, no, The Bible says that the end of a thing -The beginning was fun though. -Yeah, we're towards the end, so the end The beginning has been good Sometimes God saves the best for last. -Titus spreading the word. So you give those pamphlets -Yeah, anybody I can. -They usually accept them pretty well? -Yeah, like probably 99% of the people at least in Kentucky, Tennessee, they do. They accept them but I have been like 50% of people will say, There's a lot more openness in this area than there is [Peter] That looks like a prime zone [Titus] Yeah. [Peter] Same guy. [man] Do you have shoes? -I... I go barefoot in the summer. I love being barefoot. I have 'em at home if I need 'em. -You don't need a pair? That's so kind of you to offer. -I turned around 'cause I seen, -That's so kind of you but I'm good. I love being barefoot. -[man] Where y'all headed? -Yeah, we're headed -You Mennonite? -No, I'm not Amish or Mennonite -Oh, do you? Well like I said, I was getting on I thought I had [Peter] That's so cool of you. I was like I'll come back -[Titus] So kind of you. [Peter] Appreciate it. [chuckling] [Peter] Bob saved us Thee and a half hours standing there. So Bob, how are things -Good, no issues. Everybody's pretty much employed. People are still spending some money. -What's your line of work? -I am sort of retired as of June 30th. So I worked in the steel industry -Oh, wow. [Titus] What kind of steel work -Running a steel plant. [Peter] Do you need coal to make steel? Is that a necessity? -To take iron ore out of the earth you need either coal slash coke -And hydrogen's -It just isn't established yet, correct? The issue with hydrogen right now is with cracking natural gas and that's not great. So when somebody green hydrogen economically, that will be the utopia... -How many years out do you think that is -Probably 15. -Fifteen? Okay. -Europe's spending -They're much further ahead. -Whereas what we're doing more in the USA is shutting down blast furnaces Which is good. They use a lot less coal and coke but you need scrap steel. -Okay. -So some place you had to -So when someone says that would be detrimental -Yeah. -I mean if we're not even talking -Yeah. I knew nothing about it two months ago. -It's a political topic to say the least. -Right, okay, -Yeah, I mean it's... How much of the heat How much of it is you have -So you need nuclear? Solar, wind? -Well I mean nuclear Other folks aren't crazy about it For me it's a very viable option. -Okay. -Solar... whether it be solar, or wind, or water, any of those The question is how do you store for when the sun's not out, So what's your battery? And then we get into lithium batteries, and all the costs, -And you need cobalt. -Which comes from DRC. -Which is like slave labor these days. -So why'd you decide to pick us up? You know, you could easily cruise by. -Forty years ago somebody picked me up and it was miserable out. And so if I can, I do. [Titus] Wow. [Peter] Do you do it often? -I see more people walking than I see someone looking for a ride. Um... Once in a while I'll stop and ask if they want a ride. Nine times out of ten, they say, &quot;Sure.&quot; [Titus] That's really kind of you that was given to you years ago. ...world would be a better place the kindness that we've received [man] I do believe [Titus] Yes. -[Titus] Thank you so much. -Bye-bye. -[Peter] Titus, we're getting close. [Titus] Yeah. This is a good exit, -You've been to this exit? -Why do you like it, Titus? -I just got rides quick. So kind of you, [Peter] We were there... Juan, thank you. -No worry, my friend. -40 minutes to Nashville. [Juan] Driving to Nashville. -[Peter] You're originally from Mexico? -Do you like United States? -Only for work. -Only for work? United States, good for money. -Juan, what do you do for work? -Block, demolition, construction, mechanic, everything. [both] Wow. -Originally I work here for two years, -You're gonna go back? The work in the USA is hard. So it's good pay for Mexico. All week, on Saturday Maybe I have in my pocket $100. Every week for pay my lunch -And then your family is in Mexico? -In Mexico I have my wife and four kids. -Oh, wow. What's this, Juan? -Oh, that's for my baby. I... the machine, I take this one. -The claw machine? -Yeah, I put it right here for her. All the time thinking my family somber country [music fades] [Peter] Thank you, Juan. -No problem, my friend. -For the gas For the ninos, ninos. [Juan] No, no... I give you a ride to help. [Peter] Thank you, Juan. You're a good man. I glad help you, Okay? -Good luck. -We're here, Titus, what a journey. -Wow... wow. What a panorama there. -Right... skyline of Nashville. You fit right in, Titus. -I don't know... -I don't know, but I know that God sent me here. So this is where I need to be. -As long as you run it with confidence, -That's right. -Don't let your identity be based on You know, be who you are. Find your core values in God's word and then be the man What everybody else is doing, don't let that make you who you are. Titus is going to people pumping gas and others in the store The thing I love about Titus... there are many things I love about Titus, but he has full confidence He's a true believer in his way of life. He's kind, energetic, fun to be around. I'm just saying and how I really enjoy -Likewise, it goes both ways. Without Jesus in my life So it's because of him. He's the one that makes me -You were very depressed? -Very... yes. Very depressed. And I just thought it would be better rather than try to go on -So by having Jesus Christ, -Yes. -...a terrible situation. -Yeah, he took me out of that dark place and brought me into And what he did for me, That's why I'm here in Nashville. How are you? [man] Going on the YouTube? [Peter] Yeah, Titus is preaching, -Oh great, right on. [Titus] I like your hair. -Thank you, I like your beard. I'm hungry but I love that -Okay. [both chuckling] -Well, I used to just want to kill myself and I was very discouraged, I just thought life was not worth living and then when I invited Jesus he changed me And what I've experienced with Jesus, -That's beautiful, man. I love that. -Yeah. -I had a similar experience. -Wow... neat... neat. -Um... For me it was more Um... So I grew up Christian who were talking the talk or whatever, I was like, &quot;Where are all the martyrs?&quot; &quot;Where is everyone selling You know what I mean? Um, and then I discovered that... Um, at least a part of my calling was Which was a way to and in doing so I asked for -Wow. -And now I feel like I &quot;know&quot; a lot less but I feel a lot more peace. -Yeah. [Peter] You feel a lot of peace with it? -Is it because Like it's God's will, it's up to God. Like is that how it works with you guys? I'm reading this through Titus today where he exports because it's all because of God. So if we can't get picked up it's like... Oh, God's will. -[all chuckling] It's sort of like with everything. -Absolutely, and I've noticed... I have a story. So my car got stolen this time, right? My battery had been dying I was at Kroger to jump my car again So I left it running I go in, come back my car's gone. Long story short, I felt God's peace the instant it happened because I knew one, that I would But I knew even if that I was gonna be okay, provided for. That's exactly what happened. and I ended up getting my car back Without any law enforcement because it was a lesson in overcoming Because I ended up to a really sketchy place where everyone It was a lesson for my mom because all of this that I'd been doing... I was living with her. She really just saw that as Why don't you get a job I'm like, &quot;No, this is what's important.&quot; She got to see that in action and then the woman who stole my car, I was able to forgive her in that moment, and she got a lesson in like... You're not gonna get away with, but you'll always be forgiven. And that was just... I... This is turning into my testimony. [Titus] It's beautiful. -I took a cross country road trip [woman] Million dollar winner right here. [Peter] Million dollar... this guy? [all laughing] -You're going home -Yes I am. -Pork, beans... -Uh-huh, and some potatoes. [laughs] -Yeah, but I... I prayed, and I meditated, and the holy spirit told me I did by myself and I discovered that I Car was crap, It was very irresponsible I actually lost my license Super... [Peter] You guys have that in common. -Yeah, I don't have I mean I drive horse and buggy -But every time somber country [Titus] No, I don't have nothing on me, [woman speaking incoherently] [man] Hey, you got smoke? [Peter] Okay, here's his message, [Titus] I'd like to share Jesus has changed my life and I'd like This is in Isaiah, chapter 42. I'll sing it for you, y'all like songs? [man] That's all I do is sing all day.
