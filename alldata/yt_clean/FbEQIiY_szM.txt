Bodhidharma, a master from South India. Originally named &quot;Bodhitara&quot;, later changed his name to &quot; Bodhidharma&quot;. Known as a grandmaster for teaching martial arts to Shaolin monks, But his main focus was to spread the &quot;Two Entries and Four Practices&quot; Zen teaching. He's considered the founder of Chinese Buddhism. And his teachings have greatly influenced Chinese culture. Amitabha Old man, can you tell me where we are? To you, this is a foreign land. Even if I told you, you'd still be clueless! You don't know a thing! This is my kingdom, and I will inherit the throne here! You can't even comprehend your current situation, let alone the future. I suggest you just go with the flow! When will this fog ever clear? What you see as fog is merely an illusion to me. I see nothing. Old man, why are you here? I've been waiting for you. Waiting for me?! I don't even know you. But I know you! So what? Everyone knows I'm the third prince. Not only do I know you're the third prince, but I also know your past and future! Future?! Didn't you just say you can't be sure? But I can be certain about everything concerning you! Alright! What's going to happen to me today? You'll face immense danger with slim chances of survival. And then what? Just like me, you'll sit for nine years. How dare you spout nonsense at me! Who are you, actually? I am you. You are me? Your Highness...Your Highness. Your Highness, the King has suddenly fallen gravely ill, and his time is running out. You must hurry back to the palace! Your Highness, wait for me! My head, oh! Kill him! Kill him! It seems Father's days are numbered, and the throne... Hasn't it already been decided that the throne will go to the third brother? He'll never return. Father! Father! Father...Father. There's nothing we can do. Father, Father. Why is this happening? Why is everyone silent? Father...Father. How dare you, vengeful spirit, possess a human body?! I've come for vengeance. He destroyed my dynasty and killed my entire family. In half an hour, he'll be just like me. When will this cycle of violence end?! The only way to dissolve hatred is to forgive others with a compassionate heart. By seeking revenge and killing another, you only add to your sins. If you remain stubborn and don't realize this, you'll surely fall into hell! Hell?! Here's what you can do: let go of your hatred, and I'll help you cross over. Only then will you have the chance to journey to the Western Paradise and be free from the suffering of reincarnation. The Western Paradise?! Thank you for your guidance, master. Good! Well done, well done. Om Mani Padme Hum Father! Father! Father! What's going on? Nothing! Nothing, just rest. Master, the king has sent me to give you this valuable orb. May I ask the three princes, is there anything in this world more valuable than this radiant orb? This orb can shed light on all things in the world, and there's no other treasure quite like it. Only a virtuous person like you, Master, deserves to possess this treasure. And what about you?! My brother has already said what I wanted to say. The light of the orb only illuminates others, it cannot illuminate itself. I believe the most precious thing in the world is the light of wisdom. What is the light of wisdom? The light of wisdom is the light of intellect. It not only brightens a person's heart but also distinguishes right from wrong. Among all things, what has no form? Among all things, non-arising has no form. Among all things, what is the highest? Humanity is the highest. What is the greatest? The nature of the Dharma is the greatest. I've gratefully accepted the gift from the king. Master, may I host a meal for my father? Of course. Please. Do you have a lot on your mind when you look out the window? I don't dare think! I don't dare think! When you meditate with your eyes closed, don't you have a lot on your mind as well? What has happened is a fact, and there's not much to contemplate about the future! Just thinking won't fill your stomach! Although the vegetarian dishes are light, if you eat like this every day, I'm afraid you'll become malnourished and weak! Aren't cows strong even though they live on grass? The physical structure and nutritional needs of cows and humans differ. I've maintained my strength eating vegetarian food since I was young. Both humans and cows have flat teeth in their mouths. Actually, eating meat goes against the laws of nature. Humans are the most intelligent beings. How can we compare ourselves to animals? I believe that anything with its back to the sky can be eaten. Then can he be eaten? Aren't you leaving? Apologies. It seems that Your Highness's light of wisdom flickers inconsistently. If you can let go of distractions and focus on your spiritual practice, you will surely advance the Buddha's teachings and save all beings in the future. I'm different from you, Master. You've been practicing since you were young, while I am a prince. I think I have no connection with the Buddha in this life! All right, let everything be as it is. Before my birth, who was I to be? After I was born, who became me? Before my birth, who was I to be? After I was born, who became me? Who became me? Your Highness. Chamberlain, please inform my brother that I've caught a few pheasants. We'll have a feast tonight! I don't know what's been going on with His Highness lately. He hasn't touched meat or wine for months and only eats vegetarian dishes. Before my birth, who was I to be? After I was born, who became me? What does that mean? Excuse me, is Master Prajnatara here? Yes, please come in. One bow is enough. Who told you to become a monk? It was my Master who told me to become a monk. Don't you have any initiative? Say it again. I want to become a monk myself. You have no respect for your master at all. Just acting on your own! I'll give you another chance. Seeing your pure nature and a hint of goodness, I'll accept you as my disciple. Thank you, Master! Why did you decide to become a monk? You're not mute, so why aren't you speaking?! No answer can truly explain my longing to seek the Buddha's way, it's better to say nothing. Very well. Since you're determined to seek the path of the Buddha, you should first build a stable meditation room as a sign of your sincerity. Weren't you freaked out being out all night? He's the one who asked me to stay. Well, that makes me feel better. How dare you seduce my wife! Who seduced your wife?! She came onto me. Stay away! Don't run! We're gonna settle this! I swear I won't do it again! Please, stop! I'm not letting you off easy! Stop running! Wait for me! Maybe Buddhism just isn't for you. Give it up! You don't need to bring him food anymore. I finally finished building it. Master. Why did you tear it down? I was foolish. It took me so long to build the meditation room. Is that really &quot;finished&quot;? To say it's finished isn't accurate, it's more like I've discovered it. The path of Buddhist practice is within the heart. Follow me! The first strike cuts away all worries. The second strike pledges to practice all good deeds. The third strike vows to save all sentient beings. Now I grant you the Dharma name... Bodhidarma. Remember, only after sixty-seven years since my death can you go to China. Don't be too hasty. Monks don't work the fields or do any labor, yet they receive offerings from people and only study Buddhist teachings. But nobody can explain what Buddha is to me! Step back... step back! It's all superstition and blind faith! All of you must leave the monastery and never return! Throw them all out of the monastery! Don't hit... You move like you're flying. Are you good or evil? If Your Highness could tell right from wrong, you wouldn't reject Buddhism. You seem quite articulate. Though I don't know much, I can help clear up your doubts. What is Buddha? Enlightenment is Buddha. I still don't understand? It lies in action. So how can one truly comprehend? There are eight methods that will surely make you understand! What are the eight methods? Entrance to life by karmic ties, Gaining experience as we live our lives. Eyes witness the world's sights, Nose senses the bitter and the sweet alike. Talking brings knowledge to our minds, While the body endures the pain we find. Through these experiences we gain, Insight into the truth of all things. Only then can we clearly see our true nature. How can we see it if we are attached? Your Highness, have you gained any insight? If not... I would rather die in front of you. You truly grasp the Buddhist teachings. Who is your master? It's your third uncle, Bodhidharma! My third uncle? Isn't he dead already? Your Highness, please pack my things for me. Sure thing. So, you're really going to China to spread Zen teachings? I have to find a worthy disciple so that Zen Buddhism can thrive there. Don't you think it's too challenging to go on such a long journey across mountains and oceans? Maybe you should reconsider. It's my destiny. Okay, then let me help by contacting Chinese temples to prepare for your arrival. Let it be as fate wills it. Bodhidharma, the founder of Zen Buddhism, journeyed to China, enduring a three-year voyage, and finally arrived at the South China Sea during the first year of Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty. At that time, China was in the midst of the Southern and Northern Dynasties, with constant warfare and people struggling to survive. In addition to spreading Buddhism, Bodhidharma sought to find his successor to inherit his robe and bowl. LongFa Temple What's up with you? Don't worry, I'm fine. During the Southern Dynasty, thanks to Emperor Wu of Liang's devout belief in Buddhism and his promotion of the Buddhist way, the land under his rule was able to maintain a semblance of peace and prosperity. The eminent Grandmaster Bodhidharma of the Indian Zen lineage shall journey to the Eastern lands, arriving in the Southern Dynasty to propagate the teachings of the Buddha. DongLin Temple has received the imperial edict to extend its gracious hospitality. Our nation's people wholeheartedly embrace the Buddhism, and thus this proclamation is set forth to spread the word far and wide. How's everything going up there? Almost done. Go over there. You go there, hurry up! Yes. Amitabha. Take our guests to the meditation room to rest. Yes. Please follow me. Senior, we have settled the abbot and monks of the PuTuo Temple. Keep in mind that it's the Emperor's decree for us to host the Indian monk. Plus, abbots from various temples will be arriving soon. so you must handle everything perfectly and not embarrass us. Get everything ready! Yes, senior. Go clean the toilets! Senior, Master Bodhidharma has arrived at the entrance. Tell everyone to get ready to welcome him! I'll go inform the Master. Yes. Master. Amitabha. Master, your tireless journey from the east to spread the Dharma is truly a blessing for our land. I am deeply honored to welcome you today. There's no need for excessive formalities between monks. Master, where are your disciples? I didn't bring any. What about your scriptures? I didn't bring those either. Master, what's going on? Master, you're well-versed in the teachings of Buddha and surely carry the scriptures in your heart. Please recite some for us, Master! Please. What's happening? I don't know. Master, why isn't he speaking? It might be an Indian custom. Amitabha. Shanmeng, he's starting his sermon now. Master, are you leaving just like that? Shanmeng, show some respect! It's him who's being disrespectful! Shanmeng, did you offend him in some way? No, we didn't! Then why isn't he giving his sermon?! How should I know? Master Bodhidharma left with a smile on his face. I understand now. What do you understand? Perhaps Indian monks give sermon without speaking. But how can he speak without using his mouth? Senior, isn't that the Indian monk? Let me tell you: The pure lotus grows from the mud. You should only take the purity of the lotus and not the murkiness of the mud. I didn't expect you to speak such wisdom so easily, Senior. Even a lotus born from the mud can be appreciated. Discard its flaws and keep its core. That's amazing! Adapt to change, yet remain unchanged. If mud can produce a lotus, then it must be good soil. What? So there's value in the mud too?! Based on what you're saying, there's no absolute right or wrong! Even the bad can have its good points. What kind of reasoning is that? There's no good or bad, it varies from person to person. That actually makes sense! What do you know?! Is your hand clenched into a fist now, or is your fist made of your hand? Is this like the chicken or the egg question? The egg came first. But how can there be an egg without a chicken?! The egg came first! The chicken came first. There's no before or after, both are correct. It depends on the context. I get it now. You get it again?! What exactly did you get?! The master's words - let everything be, don't get attached. Ordinary people change with circumstances, while enlightened ones remain unchanged. It all sounds so vague. I don't understand. You'd better find someone who can make you understand. After all this talking, I think that person is you. It's not me! It's you yourself. Master, you are an enlightened person. So let me ask you, where do you go after death? I don't know. There's something you don't know?! Because I haven't died yet. You can't talk once you enter the meditation room. Yes, senior. Inside? Meditating in silence for three days and nights. The oil lamp went out! Why did you speak?! We're not supposed to speak! I'm the only one who hasn't spoken. Master, what are you doing? What are you all doing? We're meditating to become enlightened! I'm trying to turn a tile into a mirror! Can a tile really be turned into a mirror? If you can't turn a tile into a mirror, then how can meditation make you enlightened? So how do we achieve enlightenment? You must understand that enlightenment has no fixed form, and meditation is not just about sitting or lying down. You only focus on the act of sitting without understanding its purpose, so you'll never find the path. How can we find the path then? Start at the root. What's the root? The heart is the root. Sins arise from the heart and are extinguished there too. All good and evil come from the heart. If you can't grasp this principle and only work on the surface, you're wasting your time. Wasting time?! Master! Master! Your Majesty, even with countless responsibilities each day, you still make time to discuss Buddhism with Master Bodhidharma. Your merit is truly immeasurable. Who would've thought that Indian monks are so poor they can't even afford shoes! The wind stirs the bell! In my humble view, it's your heart that's stirred. Your Majesty. Master, your words are filled with wisdom. It's an honor to have met you. Your Highness, I've heard from afar that you're known as the &quot;Bodhisattva Emperor&quot; of the Liang Dynasty, so I journeyed here to spread the teachings of Buddhism. Your timing couldn't be better. Since my ascension to the throne, I've built temples, crafted Buddha statues, copied scriptures, and supported countless monks. What merit have I earned, Master? No merit. It's like the shadow of an object - it appears to be there, but in reality, it's not. What kind of deeds would be considered meritorious? Only those who have achieved pure and complete enlightenment possess merit. Such merit is very hard to find in this world. Master, does the Buddha exist in this world? No. As a monk, do you know who you are? I don't know. This conversation isn't getting us anywhere. Guards, show our guest out! I'm no longer a general, why do you keep pushing me like this? I must avenge my fallen brothers. You just can't let it go, can you?! I won't rest until I've avenged them, dead or alive! What's the matter?! You've been kneeling for so long, you must have something to say to me! Master, I still have nightmares sometimes. Please show me a way to find relief! Haven't I told you? The past dies with yesterday. Recite more scriptures, and let today is born anew! But I already recite so many scriptures every day, Master! Then you must continue with even greater focus. Master, I always recite the scriptures with a sincere heart seeking repentance. That's not right! When reciting scriptures, you should seek nothing in your heart. Thank you for your guidance, Master! Master, let me help. No need. Actually, Master, you don't have to come here every day. We disciples are here, so why work so hard? Working for others is also a form of cultivation. Your future achievements will surpass mine. Even a single good thought can lead to enlightenment. Remember, a true gentleman should strive to improve himself constantly. That's a Confucian saying. Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism all share the same roots! There's no real distinction among them. What's most important is having peace of mind. Shenguang, don't be too attached. Who is that guy? He's that Indian monk, we should leave quickly or we'll be unlucky. Wait... Be careful... Zhang, you better start the boat quickly. That Indian monk is coming. Indians eat with their dirty hands. Yeah! They even use their hands to clean in the toilet. Look, he's holding your daughter. Hurry and take her back! The boat's full! Hurry up! Hey! You two, get on the boat quickly. Come on... Are we really not letting him on the boat? They're just picking on him because he's a foreigner. Look, it's getting dark. If he doesn't get on this boat, he'll have to wait until tomorrow. Just ignore it. Look at him waiting there! Even if he waits until dawn, I won't let him on the boat. That's right! Well said! My daughter! My daughter fell in the water! Don't be scared! Don't cry! Your dad is coming! You know, becoming a bird in this life is the result of your past life's karma. Being injured by an arrow is also due to the karmic retribution. Don't hold any resentment in your heart. I'll take the Three Refuges for you so that you can practice well in your next life as a human. Off you go! You're looking for your prey, aren't you? Yeah, that's the plan. How many animals can you hit with a single arrow? Just one. But sometimes if I'm lucky, I can hit two! Two?! That's like killing two birds with one stone, huh? I bet it's even more if you're lucky, you might hit a pregnant one! Right! Then it'd be more than just two! I can only hit one, but by hitting that one, countless beings can find peace. What's that one? It's you. Me? I don't kill, but others do! Flesh and blood dripping, a savory delight, Pain and suffering, hard to express in plight, Put oneself in others' shoes, empathize and feel, Who can cut themselves with their own steel? We've been trying to reason with you for so long, but you're still so stubborn. Staying up all night to avoid nightmares won't solve anything! Yeah, keep this up, and we'll have to lock you up like a lunatic. Yeah! Lock him up! Master. You all go back first! Yes, Master. Master, why are you cutting yourself? What's it to you if I cut my own thigh? Master, it hurts me to see you harm yourself like this! I thought you were a heartless person. Master, I realize my mistake now! In our spiritual journey, we must confront our inner demons. Only with a resolute heart can we break through. Thank you for your guidance, Master. Master, let's go! If I could walk, I would have left already! How is it? Is it hard for you to carry me? It's not a burden if I don't think of it as one! Master Kongzhi. Amitabha. Master Kongzhi. Amitabha. Master Kongzhi, you have quite the reputation. You're highly respected. In following the Buddha's teachings, we mustn't be attached to gains or losses. Seeking fame can lead to emotions like joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. As monks, we should rise above good and evil, gain and loss, only then can we realize the emptiness of all things. Senior, we will certainly keep your teachings in mind. This Indian monk doesn't seem all that special. His skin is darker than most monks! I heard his understanding of Buddhism is incredibly deep! Heard? My cousin saw him actually cross a river on a single reed! Really? I don't believe it. You must be Master Bodhidharma, right? I am Kongzhi, and my understanding of Buddhism is quite limited. I'd like to ask for your guidance! If the mind, Buddha, and sentient beings are all empty, then the things we experience must also be illusions! There's no distinction between sacred and mundane, giving and receiving, good and evil. Everything is empty, right?! Why did you hit me? If everything is empty as you say, then where does pain come from? Seeing the unseen, hearing the unheard, and knowing the unknown, that is true wisdom! What? Are you just going to leave like this? Brother! Did he knock some sense into you, senior? Don't say any more. Words can't explain it. You can only feel it with your heart. Master, it's him. Amitabha. I'm Mingshan, the abbot of this temple. He hasn't moved at all since last night. Hey, my master is addressing you! Show some respect. It seems he practices differently. Since he came to our temple's back hill, it must be fate. Let him meditate in peace. Let's go! Jingyuan, you'll be responsible for providing his meals. Yes. Jingyuan told me the monk from India hasn't eaten for seven days and nights. Not just that! They say he hasn't even had a sip of water. I also heard he hasn't even used the restroom! He ate... he ate something! What's going on? Let's go! Let's go see! Go! Look! He ate! He ate! Oh my, he really ate! No, he still hasn't eaten. Let's go, let's not disturb him anymore. Jingde, let me show you something. Has it been that long since he last ate? Not only has he not had a drop of water, but he also hasn't spoken for half a year! Really?! He hasn't spoken in half a year?! Of course! I'm not lying. Doesn't his breath stink? Let's go! It's right here, take a look! Jingde, look but don't touch. Jingde, the oil lamp is out of oil. Add some, please! This is truly incredible! Remember, don't come here without me guiding you. Yes, senior. He's been sitting in this cave for three years, like an untoppling doll! He really hasn't moved for three whole years?! Of course! Just look at him, he hasn't budged an inch. Can that be true? Of course! Why else would so many people come to worship him! Master Zhigong, I heard there's an extraordinary holy monk at Shaolin Temple. Do you know about him? I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him. Surprisingly, it's you, Your Majesty, who has spoken with him. He's none other than Master Bodhidharma, the one you once summoned. What?! No way! To be honest, he seems to know nothing about Buddhism. I asked him about all the good deeds I've done for Buddhism, and he dared to say I had no merit! Master Bodhidharma was right! Please forgive my candor, Your Majesty. Your Majesty did have merit. But when you constantly seek praise for your good deeds, you're deliberately craving merit. When good and evil are equal, there's no merit left! Fine! Let's say he was right. I asked him if there was a Buddha, and he said there wasn't! He had a point there, too! Your Majesty, you must understand that the Buddha has no physical form, it exists only in the mind. Since you asked where Buddha is, how can you expect Buddha to exist when it's absent from your own heart? So he can't even answer who he himself is? It's remarkable that Master Bodhidharma has reached a state of selflessness. He truly is an enlightened monk. General Peng! At your service, Your Majesty. Immediately gather your troops and escort the esteemed Master Bodhidharma to the palace from Shaolin Temple. Your Majesty, Shaolin Temple is in the Northern Wei territory. Wouldn't sending my troops there cause conflicts? Can't you figure something out? As you command! Once Master Bodhidharma arrives, I'll have him stay in the palace to discuss Buddhist principles with me every day. If it's not meant to be, why force it? I, Peng Wenhai, at the command of Emperor Liang, humbly invited your to the palace, Master Bodhidharma. Please excuse my impudence. Take him away! You can't do this! Gather our forces! Despite all our efforts, he still doesn't budge. Does this mean I'm really not destined to walk the path of the Buddha? To say you're not destined is, in fact, to say you are. Your Majesty, since you mentioned destiny, whether it's meant to be or not is all a matter of one's thoughts! I've worshipped Buddha for years, and only now have you revealed this truth to me. Let's just leave everything to destiny then. Isn't my destiny with you just the same, Master? Shenguang, follow me! Come on, follow me! Shenguang... Shenguang. The bunny. Bunny! It's me calling you, not a bunny. Daydreaming again! Master! As you've said, the dream has shown you the path. Head south, and you will find enlightenment. What?! Master, you're asking me to leave Longfa Temple?! It's not that I want you to leave, but the time has come. What must happen will happen. When you're out, people call you &quot;Master&quot; now, don't they? Why are your eyes red? I just can't bear to leave you, Master. In this world, there are no never-ending feasts. Have I taught you in vain? Still acting like a child?! Take care, Master. Stop! Stop right there! Damn it! You dare steal from me?! Let me make amends for her wrongs! Hang her up! Sir, please don't continue in your ignorance. Mind your own business! Get lost! Miss, please return what you stole from them. Miss, how did you end up in such a predicament? I escaped here with my family. My father was unfortunately injured. I heard that in Shaolin Temple there is an Unfalling Monk with boundless wisdom, so I set out alone to seek his blessing for my family. The Unfalling Monk? May I ask where Shaolin Temple is? Just keep heading south from here. Miss, don't do anything foolish! Although you've made some mistakes, don't punish yourself. Just learn from them and change! The Unfalling Monk is just a rumor, I don't know whether I should go or not! That's not right! If you have the desire to pursue Buddhism, start with faith first! And you'll have a chance to achieve your goal! Our lives are brief, only spanning a few decades. Subtract childhood naivety and the frailty of old age, and the time spent sleeping, we're left with just over ten thousand days. We must cherish this precious time and do more good deeds to make up for our mistakes. What's going on?! There's a fire! It's out. My clothes are dry, I should change back into them. Thank you, master. I'm just an ordinary woman, so it might not be appropriate for me to accompany you to Shaolin Temple. I'll head out first, take care of yourself! My name is Bunny. Bunny?! Amitabha. Senior, today feels even colder than the past few days. How about... What?! You want to leave early again? Jingde, come earlier tomorrow morning to refill the oil lamps. Master. It's important to write down my master's name, Chenyang, he'll donate 200 taels of silver! Jingde. Sir, your merits are boundless. Master. Has the brother on the back mountain woken up? I've already given him some hot porridge, but his body is still very weak. It seems this person is devout, surely seeking something from the holy monk! You've been kneeling in the snow for three days and nights. What do you seek? Please grant me peace of mind, master. You have unrest in your heart?! Even though I'm dedicated to seeking the Way, I still feel uneasy at times. Then give me your heart, and I will bring peace to it. Why can't I find my restless heart? I have already put your heart at ease. Please accept me as your disciple, master. Why don't you first reflect upon yourself when asking me for the Way? To know the causes from past lives, behold the present we receive. To see the fruits of lives to come, observe the actions we conceive. If you are determined enough to seek the Way even at the cost of losing an arm, then what is impossible for you? Now I grant you the Dharma name Huike. Today we gathered about 300 taels from the oil lamp donations. Master Bodhidharma sat in the cave for nine whole years, and who could've imagined the blessings it would bring us. Junior, tomorrow you'll lead a group to distribute the donations to various locations. Understood. Alright, let's get going! We'll head out early tomorrow. Yes. What are you doing? Who are you people? This isn't right. You'll pay for this! But we've already reaped our rewards now! Please, I can't accept this! Let's go! There's a fight over there! Stop it! This is a sacred Buddhist place. Please, no violence. As the saying goes, respect the Buddha even if you don't respect the monk. Respect the Buddha? Even if you brought the Buddha himself, I still wouldn't give a damn! Amitabha. Amitabha. Look at these monks who usually worship the Buddha, and today they're bowing at my feet. Big Brother, they're not bowing to you. Who is he? He's the Weeble from the cave. A Weeble?! I'll make him topple over right now! Damn it! You want to keep it for yourself?! Big Brother... Don't call me that! I'll kill you! Brothers clashing, spilling flood, Feasting on the karma they've both stored. Attack! This is outrageous! A bunch of fools! Let's see how you dodge this! Sir, if you truly need it, you can take it. Amitabha. My fellow disciples, your bodies are weak. Before I leave, I will teach you some methods to build up your muscles and bones, which will also boost your overall health. Martial arts and literature share similarities, having both active and passive components. Actually, our everyday activities, like eating and sleeping, fall into this category as well. To truly understand Zen, you need to pay close attention. Every movement and gesture carries its own Zen significance. I'll be heading back to India soon. Share with me the insights you've gained from your studies. Words help clarify the true essence of Buddhism. Don't get hung up on them, but don't discard them either. Only then will we reap the rewards of enlightenment. You have only acquired my skin. From what I can tell, it's like a glimpse into the realm of Akshobhya Buddha. Once you've seen it, there's nothing more to seek and no need to see it again. You've gone deeper than Daofu, but you have only acquired my flesh. Earth, water, fire, and air are all empty. Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, and feeling are not real. Yet, I see nothing truly exists! You've only reached my bones! How about you, Huike? That's it, you've grasped my marrow. Those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know. Huike, I now pass on my robe to you as a symbol of the Dharma transimission. You are the Second Patriarch of Zen Buddhism! Two hundred years after I'm gone, the robe will go to the Sixth Patriarch and won't need to be passed on anymore, since Zen teachings will have spread far and wide by then. However, many will know the path, but few will walk it; many will speak of wisdom, but few will attain it. So, do not look down on those who are deluded. Anyone can turn from evil to good in a single thought! These four scrolls of the Lankavatara Sutra hold the Buddha's most profound teachings and can bring enlightenment to the world. I now entrust them to you. Listen, Upon this land I've come to dwell. To share the Dharma, lost to quell. One blossom blooms, five leaves unfold. Fruits of wisdom naturally foretold. Master, where are you headed all on your own? Oh, it's you from the incense shop. I'm heading west. Why are you traveling alone, Master? You'll find out when you get back! A straw sandal! Where could he be going? Hey! Why do you have to deliver the incense yourself? I didn't have a choice. Buddhism is thriving everywhere. My only assistant became a boss too! Here... let me help you! No need! I bumped into Master Bodhidharma on the road last night. That's impossible! Master Bodhidharma entered Nirvana over three months ago! I'm telling you, I saw him clearly - his walking stick even had a straw sandal hanging on it. This... Regarding the story of Master Bodhidharma heading west with only one sandal, the emperor sought to verify the truth and ordered the coffin to be opened. As a result, they discovered only a single sandal inside the coffin. By that time, Master Bodhidharma was already 150 years old.
