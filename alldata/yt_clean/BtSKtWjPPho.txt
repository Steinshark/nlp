Ozgur: It's stuck. Burcu: Is that sound coming from you? Burcu: Tell those friends of yours... Ozgur: Why don't you go somewhere else? Ozgur: Off you go, I'll light a fire there now. Burcu: It's the same color as the grass. Ozgur: Go away. Ozgur: Come on. Ozgur: Come on. Shoo. Hah, finally. Burcu: I think it's broken, isn't it? Ozgur: I mean, it's rotten. Ozgur: Check out that hawk, how nice it's flying. Burcu: Huh? Burcu: Oh yeah. Burcu: That thing smelled like perfume, it's so good. Ozgur: Can you hear the stove? Ozgur: It's hot as hell here. Ozgur: Now I'll warm up this side. Burcu: Should we eat inside or outside? Ozgur: I'll eat outside, but you may get cold. Burcu: It's cold, let's eat inside now. We'll eat outside in the morning. Burcu: The table is dusty. Ozgur: That one is too thick. I'll eat this one. Ozgur: I can hear the chirping sound. Ozgur: Could you give me the thing... Burcu: The spatula? Burcu: I hope it's cooked. Ozgur: I don't know if it's cooked or not. Ozgur: Yeah. Ozgur: It's cooked. Burcu: Give me your plate. Burcu: It's good, isn't it? Ozgur: It's really good. Thank you. It's better with onion. Ozgur: High five then. Burcu: What are we giving high fives for? Burcu: How about some popcorn? Ozgur: What? Ozgur: I can make popcorn. Burcu: No, I said should &quot;I&quot;. Burcu: Okay, you can do it. Burcu: Turn it off. Ozgur: Oh, it looks good. Ozgur: The one that says hatch. Ozgur: Salt doesn't stick to it. Burcu: Do you want another one? Burcu: That's fine. Ozgur: It's great here. Burcu: Take the remote. Ozgur: Thank you. Ozgur: Good night then. Burcu: Good night. Ozgur: It's raining. Burcu: Uh, yeah. Burcu: The rain has started. Burcu: So, we can't go out for breakfast again? Ozgur: Yes. Ozgur: It's a small cloud. Burcu: It's pretty wet around here. Ozgur: It has rained pretty good then. Burcu: I mean, we cannot go one step further. Ozgur: Why? I can go. Ozgur: That's right. Ozgur: Because It's not flowing away. Ozgur: Let's wipe the table. Burcu: Uh, it hit my hand. Burcu: Should I grind some more? Ozgur: Honey, it spills over the edge of this glass. Ozgur: For God's sake. Burcu: I just bought this cover. Ozgur: Will it come off? It will. Ozgur: It will come out. Ozgur: I will. Ozgur: Is this a shot? Ozgur: Then we need to do shots. Burcu: It looks like the rain is coming from the other side. Ozgur: But that cloud.... Ozgur: comes and goes. Burcu: Do you think there are mushrooms in the forest? Burcu: Should we look for some mushrooms? Burcu: We'll eat mushrooms for breakfast if we can find them. Ozgur: Okay. Maybe we'll find meadow mushroom. Burcu: Should we open the awning? Burcu: Let's open it, so nothing gets wet. Burcu: The awning will cover the stove, right? Ozgur: Yes. Ozgur: If you see little brown things like this... Burcu: Are those meadow mushrooms? Burcu: Mushrooms? Burcu: I don't think we'll find it here. Ozgur: It might have came out of the peat. Burcu: At least we don't hear the frogs here, Ozgur Burcu: So many big trees. Ozgur: The trees are huge. Burcu: I don't see many mushrooms. Ozgur: They need sun for that. It's cloudy right now... Ozgur: If it gets a little sun, it will pop out. Burcu: Even if we didn't find anything, we had a nice walk. Ozgur: We should actually look at the meadows. Ozgur: Do you see the mushrooms? Burcu: Are those fungus? Ozgur: Most probably. Burcu: Look where it's grown from. Ozgur: Sapling? Ozgur: Look, see, these are new. Ozgur: Right? Burcu: Look. Burcu: Those are the ones that smell good, right? Burcu: I wish we'd collected them from the forest. Ozgur: That tree must have fallen down. Burcu: But it's still alive. Burcu: Yeah, but when that big tree fell down... Burcu: No, don't touch it, it will grow like that. Ozgur: It fell down here... Ozgur: Look, it damaged that one. Burcu: It fell down, injuring others in the fall. Burcu: We're getting close to the frog sounds again. Ozgur: Like a symphony orchestra. Burcu: What are you eating? Ozgur: Fresh sprout. Ozgur: Yes. Here, taste it. Ozgur: Great. Ozgur: It has an excellent flavor. Burcu: I'll make menemen, then. Burcu: I'll put the tomato now. Burcu: We have a great view. You can't see anything. Burcu: Frog sounds in the background. Burcu: It's like between raining and not raining. Burcu: Duck family. Burcu: They disappeared. Burcu: Yes, she has ducklings. Burcu: This area is pretty big. Burcu: Does atv fit in here? Burcu: But a bike will fit. Ozgur: There's a lot of compartments here. Ozgur: I'll start moving. Ozgur: Don't. Burcu: Oh no. Burcu: Come on. Burcu: How about a pallet? Burcu: Put a pallet where you slipped. Ozgur: If only I could take myself in that stone road... Burcu: Okay, just put the pallet there, and go over it.
