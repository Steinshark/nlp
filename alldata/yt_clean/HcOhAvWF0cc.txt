AND OTHER GUESTS. ED, ALL YEARS. THANK YOU, CAROL. I WOULD CALL IT ALL ARMS AT THE A.I. SUPPLY CHAIN OR MARKET GATHERED HERE AND THE THREE C.E.O.'S JUST ON STAGE TOGETHER MOMENTS AGO. OUR HOST IS MICHAEL DELL. CHAIRMAN AND C.E.O. OF DELL, A COMPANY CELEBRATING 40 YEARS AS WELL AT THIS EVENT. JENSEN WONG, AND C.E.O. OF SERVICE NOW. I THINK IT'S SENSIBLE TO ASK, IF IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT THE THREE OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME AND MICHAEL, TO YOU, AS A HOST, WHY THE THREE OF YOU IN THE SAME ROOM AT THE SAME TIME? DELL TECHNOLOGY LOVES TO BRING OUR PARTNERS TOGETHER AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NEW AND WHAT'S EXCITING. AND THIS A.I. OPPORTUNITY IS REALLY TREMENDOUS AND WE CAN NEVER DO ANYTHING BY OURSELVES BUT THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU HAVE AN ECOSYSTEM OF COMPANIES COMING TOGETHER ALONG WITH ALL THESE INCREDIBLE INNOVATIONS IN G.P.U.'S AND COMPUTE STORAGE AND NETWORKING AND ALL THE A.I. MODELS AND SOFTWARE COMPANIES THAT ARE UTILIZING ALL THIS POWER. AND IT'S CAUSING A NEW INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE THREE OF YOU AND YOUR COMPANIES, HOW YOU WORK TOGETHER AND THE SECOND BEING A.I. INFRASTRUCTURE. HOW DURABLE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. AIPC. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR SOME TIME. U.S. LEADERSHIP, THE FACT I HAVE THREE AMERICAN C.E.O.'S SITTING AROUND MORE ALL WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL BUT REALLY, JENSEN, THE ORIGIN OF THIS WAS G.T.C. YOU YOU SAID BASICALLY THERE'S NO ONE BETTER AT END-TO-END SYSTEMS OF SCALE THAN DELL. HOW IS IT THAT IN VOIDA INTERACTS WITH THAT PART OF MICHAEL'S BUSINESS? WE'VE REENGINE NEARED AND REINVENTED EVERY LAYER OF COMPUTING. FROM THE CHIP TO THE WAY THESE SYSTEMS ARE PUT TOGETHER. THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO BUILD THE COMPUTING SYSTEM, THE NETWORKING SYSTEM, ALL OF THE SOFTWARE THAT GOES WITH IT AND THE PATH TO A.I. ENTERPRISE. WE WANT TO BRING THIS ABILITY TO EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. SOME OF IT CAN BE DOWN DONE ON CLOUD. IN ORDER FOR US TO BRING THEM INTO THE A.I. REVOLUTION, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PARTNER THAT CAN HELP US TAKE THIS COMPLETELY NEW REINVENTION OF A COMPUTER AND HELP EVERY CUSTOMER HAVE A -- 1. ON PRIM IS BACK? YES OR NO? IT NEVER LEFT BUT IT'S COOL AGAIN. ED: SAVE THAT THOUGHT. BILL, YOU'VE BEEN A C.E.O. FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. HAVE YOU EVER HAD TO HAVE SUCH A FOCUS ON THE MY FUTUREA OF A SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY, A SERVER COMPANY? I THINK MICHAEL DELL AND JENSEN ARE AT THE EPICENTER OF THE A.I. EVOLUTION. THIS IS ENABLING SERVICE NOW TO BE WHAT I DREAMT IT WOULD BE. WE RUN OUR WHOLE CLOUD ON DELL TECHNOLOGIES AND THAT'S A BIG DEAL BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR BILLION WORKFLOWS AND FOUR TRILLION DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS RUNNING A MILLION BUSINESS PROCESSES AROUND THE WORLD. WITH JENSEN, WE WERE THE FIRST ENTERPRISE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE THE GREATNESS OF THIS VIDA AND WE BEGAN BUILDING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS WITH JENSEN FIVE YEARS AGO. WE'RE TAKING IT TO MARKET WITH BOTH OF THESE MEN FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. ONE, THEY'RE GREAT HUMAN BEINGS AND GREAT LEADERS AND IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH THEM TODAY AND TO TEAM UP WITH THEM AND TWO, WE KEEP OUR PROMISES. ED: YOU WERE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM WHEN FRANKLY ALL OF THIS WASN'T SEXY AND NOW IT IS. TOTALLY. THAT'S 100% TRUE AND WE'LL ALWAYS BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM BECAUSE TRUST IS THE ONLY HUMAN CURRENCY AND WE HONOR THEM WITH THEIR LIVES. ED: THERE'S A CRITICS THAT MARKETS ARE OFTEN BUILT ON CHOICE. CHOICE FOSTERS COMPETITION. COMPETITION IS THE MOTHER OF INNOVATION, SO THE SAYING GOES. I HAD A GUEST ON THE SHOW FRIDAY AND HE WAS BRUTALLY HONEST ABOUT IT. THEY LOOK AT OTHER SILICON AND BENCHMARK AND HOW IT MIGHT RELATE TO THEIR SYSTEM BUT WHAT THEY LOOK AT IS WHAT THEIR CUSTOMERS AND CLIENTS DEMAND SO THEY GIVE THEM IN RIDA. WOULD YOU SAY YOUR CLIENTS ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION? YES, WE WORK WITH THEM SO WE KNOW THEIR WORK CASE. I THINK THE REASON BILL HAS PARTNERED WITH IN VOIDA IS -- NVIDIA IS BECAUSE THEY'VE OUTENGINEERED OTHER COMPANIES AND BUILT SOFTWARE OVER MANY DECADES THAT HAS PREPARED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THE OTHER ASPECT IS EDGE, THE PHYSICAL WORLD, THE P.C., THE FACTORY FLOOR. ALL THE RETAIL STORES. A.I. IS GOING TO BE EVERYWHERE AND HAVING THAT SORT OF INTERIOR ECOSYSTEM OF PATE, THAT'S ULTIMATELY WHAT'S GOING TO DRIVE SUCCESS BUT NVIDIA IS IN A GREAT POSITION. JENSEN HAS DONE A FABULOUS JOB BRINGING THE WORLD THE MOST INNOVATIVE ACCELERATED COMPUTING SOLUTIONS. ED: WHAT IS AN A.I. FACTORY? SURE, AN A.I. FACTORY IS REALLY A SUPPLY CHAIN THAT CREATES INTELLIGENCE SO YOU THINK ABOUT A TRADITIONAL FACTORY. YOU HAVE ALL THESE INGREDIENTS AND WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT SUPPLY CHAINS. THAT'S KINDS OF WHAT WE DO. BUT THINK ABOUT IT AS A SUPPLY CHAIN TO CREATE INTELLIGENCE INSIDE YOUR COMPANY AND TO DO THAT, IT ALL STARTS WITH DATA. IF YOU HAVE NO DATA, YOU HAVE NO A.I. AND IF YOU HAVE BAD DATA, YOU HAVE BAD A.I. SO YOU HAVE TO ORGANIZE YOUR DATA. IT'S SOMETHING WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT BECAUSE WE STORE MORE DATA THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. YOU START WITH THE DATA AND THEN YOU GET INTO THE ECOSYSTEM OF ALL THE SOFTWARE AND THE MODELS THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT, SMALL AND LARGE MODELS. AUGMENTED GENERATION. IT'S NOT JUST G.P.U.'S IT'S ALSO THE NETWORKING AND STORAGE AND -- ED: YOU TALK ABOUT H100 IS NOT JUST A CHIP YOU HOLD IN YOUR HAND. IN REALITY IT'S HGX, RIGHT? YOUR STAFF HAS LET ME PLAY WITH, LET'S SAY, G.D.X., DO A DEAD LIFT WITH IT. IT'S 80,000 POUNDS. ED: THANK YOU, BUT THAT'S THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. I SEE YOU SELLING THAT TO THE HYPERSCALERS AND I'M NOT YET SEEING THE A.I. FACTRY THAT'S GOING TO THE S.I.A. OR ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER. WHEN DOES THAT REALLY HAPPEN? THAT'S WHY TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENT IS SUCH A BIG DEAL. I'M HERE TO ANNOUNCE A DELL A.I. FACTORY WITH NVIDIA GOING TO MARKET TODAY. IT HAS C.P.U.'S AND G.P.U.'S. NETWORKING, SWITCHES, INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF SOFT WEARS AND SYSTEMS CONNECTED TO STORAGE AND THE MILES OF CABLES ALONE NECESSARY TO BUILD UP ONE OF THESE THINGS -- MICHAEL TURNED ENTITLE AN EASY BUILT. AND SO JUST AS DELL DID EARLY DAYS WITH P.C.'S, THEY'RE NOW DOING THIS WITH A.I. FACTORIES SO THAT ANY COMPANY CAN COME TO DEAL WITH A SUPERVISION OR REQUIREMENT THAT COULD GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF PRODUCING INTELLIGENCE AT SCALE. IT'S ACTUALLY ALREADY HAPPENING. NOW WE'RE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH HUNDREDS OF ENTERPRISE COMPANIES AND FOR ALSO SOME SERVICES THAT GO INTO THIS BECAUSE IT'S A NEW THING, A NEW ARCHITECT AND YOU SAW US ANNOUNCE NEW CAPABILITIES TODAY AROUND STORAGE AND NETWORKING. AGAIN, IT'S THIS WHOLE SOLUTION AND WE'VE CREATE THE EASY BUTTON SO ENTERPRISES WITH QUICKLY IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY THESE TOOLS. ED: DO YOU THINK THEY ARE READY FOR THIS A.I. FACTORY INVESTMENT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE ESSENTIALLY? I KNOW THEY ARE. LAST WEEK I HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH MICROSOFT AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON CO-PILOT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY C.E.O. IS WELL AWARE OF. ED: BIG AND SMALL? BIG AND SMALL WE BUILD OUR OWN DOMAIN-SPECIFIC MODELS ON THE SERVICE NOW PLATFORM. ED: WHY DOES THAT MATTER? BECAUSE WE'RE FOCUSED ON EXPERIENCES. IT'S AN $11 TRILLION MARKET OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS ACCORDING TO G.D.C. THAT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE WORLD ECONOMY IMPROVE. COMPANIES LIKE DELL TECHNOLOGIES, NVIDIA AND SERVICES NOW. BUT WE HAVE TO BE OPEN. MICROSOFT, FOR EXAMPLE, IS A GREAT PARTNER. YOU TALK ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THE ROOM BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CUSTOMERS TO HAVE THE CO-PILOT AND NOW ASSIST. WE'RE INNOVATIVE WITH JENSEN. TELECOMMUNICATIONS WAS OUR FIRST. THINK ABOUT SERVICE MANAGEMENT AND DELL NOW WITH NOW ASSIST. EVERY COMPANY IN THE WORLD AND EVERY WORKFLOW FOR EVERY COMPANY AND EVERY INDUSTRY WILL BE REENGINEERED IN 24 MONTHS. THIS IS A TSUNAMI OF CHANGE AND ONLY THE SMART ONES ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE I HAVE TO PLANT THE FLAG NOW. WHETHER THE STORY IS COMPLETE OR NOT IS NOT THE ISSUE. THE TRAIN'S MOVED OUT. IT'S ON THE FLY. ED: THE IDEA IS WHEN YOU STAND ON THE PLATFORM THE TRAIN GOES BY FAST. IF YOU'RE ON TRAIN, IT DIDN'T FEEL FAST. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT MICHAEL DELL IS VERY GOOD AT WHICH IS SELLING TO BUSINESSES, THE PUBLIC SECTOR, PROBABLY IN PLACES, JENSEN, YOU DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IS. PROBABLY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL DELL WILL CONVINCE NOSE BUSINESSES TO GET ON THE TRAIN? NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. ED: AND DO YOU NEED HIM TO? ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE BEEN PARTNERED WITH MICHAEL FOR COMING UPEN THREE DECADES. TO REACH WITH WORLD'S MARKETS THE IN OLD DAYS WE WORKED ON P.C.IZE FOR GAMERS AND CAR DESIGN AND SOEN OF THE WE'RE ABLE TO REACH WORLD'S SURPRISE THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH MICHAEL AND WITH DELL AND THE THING THAT'S REALLY EXTRAORDINARY THIS TIME IS THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DELIVERING A BOX BUT AN ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THAT ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE IS INSANELY COMPLEX. THE LAST 30 YEARS, BOTH OF OUR COMPANIES HAVE CHANGED A LOT AND HE SAID IT EARLY THAT EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE DONE HAS BEEN A PERFECT PREPARATION FOR TODAY. IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TO HELP YOU BUILD AN ENTIRE A.I. INFRASTRUCTURE, CALL DELL AND THEY'LL COME IN -- NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE ALL THE SOLUTIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES BUT THEY'LL ALSO HAVE THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES TO HELP YOU SET IT UP AND PUT IT TO WORK. WE'RE WORKING WITH DELL AND MICHAEL FROM C.P.U.'S TO GENERATING, TO SOFTWARE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STAFF. IT'S SO FUN LISTENING TO BILL, I JUST SIT HERE AND LAY BACK BUT THEY WERE EARLY IN RECOGNIZING THE ENORMOUS TRANSMA ACTIVE CAPABILITY OF GENERATIVE A.I. SERVICE NOW USED TO BE A PLATFORM OF TOOLS. NOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE A PLATFORM OF TOOLS AND AGENTS THAT HELP YOU USE THOSE TOOLS. THEY'RE SIFTING ON A GOLD MINE OF OPPORTUNITIES SO THAT WE COULD HAVE NOT JUST THE TOOLS TO USE TO RUN OUR COMPANIES. WEAR GOING TO HAVE AN A.I. OPERATING SYSTEM TO RUN ALL OF OUR COMPANIES WITH ALL THE AGENTS NECESSARY TO HELP US DO THAT. ED: THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN IS THE AIPC. IT IS HERE WORK TO TODAY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS. IS THAT FOR THE ENJOYED WORKER OR FOR EVERY HUMAN AROUND THE WORLD IN THE FIRST INSTANCE? YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A NEW WAVE OF TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE KIND OF THE EARLY ADOPTERS AND AT SOME POINTS YOU REFLECT WHETHER THERE ARE MAINSTREAM USE CASES AND WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON RIGHT NOW INSIDE COMPANIES IS YOU HAD THIS INCREDIBLE SURGE IN BUYING P.C.'S FOUR YEARS AGO WITH THE PANDEMIC. ED: COVID-RELATED, YES. YOU HAD THE BIGGEST INSTALE BASE EVER SO NOW THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE GETTING READY TO REPLACE THOSE OLD MACHINES AND THEY'RE THINKING, WOW, IN A.I.-- MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHINGO IT? . ED: IS THAT FAIR? 100%. WE CANNOT WAIT TO DO IT. WE ARE READY TO GO. THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS THE ENTERPRISE IS A TOTAL MESS. THE INDUSTRY IS VERY GOOD AT WHAT IT DOES. FOR 50 YEARS, EVERYONE SOLD INTO AN INDIVIDUAL BUYING CENTER OR A SILO. FINANCE, SALES, DEVELOPMENT. YOU HAVE AN UN-INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE. IF YOU ARE A CEO -- CIO, YOU ARE LOOKING AT AI . WHY DO YOU NEED TO CHANGE? BECAUSE YOU CAN. AND A LOT OF THEM DON'T KNOW THAT. ED: ONE SINGLE DEVICE, LIKE A LAPTOP. LET ME EXPLAIN. IT IS ABOUT INTEGRATION. 85% OF THE PROJECTS TODAY AND DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION FAILED TO DELIVER AND ARE AWAY DR. R.O.I. FOR ONE SINGLE REASON, INTEGRATION. WE ARE AS JANSSEN WAS SAYING, WE INTEGRATE THE PAST AND INVENT THE FUTURE. NVIDIA, DELL TECHNOLOGIES, THEY ARE THE FUTURE. WE STILL HAVE TO INTEGRATE THE FAT -- THE PAST. WHAT COMPANIES HAVE TO DO IS ENABLE AI BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT BY DEALING WITH THE PAST ALSO AND I THINK SIMULTANEOUSLY, IF I WERE IN A CEOS SITUATION AND NOT WORKING AT SERVICE NOW, I WOULD HAVE A COPILOT, NOW ASSIST AND THE NVIDIA STACK RUNNING EVERYTHING AND USING DELL TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE AND I AM DOING IT. ED: I GREW UP WITH DELL COMPUTERS. I'M TALKING ABOUT ME PLAYING AGE OF EMPIRES, CD-ROM, THAT DELL COMPUTER. CONVINCE ME AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE FOR NAI PC IN THEIR LIVES. YOU HAVE FIVE MODELS. THAT IS A LOT OF TOYS FOR FIRST JEN OF A NASCENT TECHNOLOGY. THE REASON IS, ANYTHING YOU ARE DOING THAT HAS A PROMPT IS GOING TO BE SPED UP BECAUSE EVERY SOFTWARE DEVELOPER IN THE WORLD IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE ALL THE NEW POWER IN THE GP USE, AND NPU'S. ED: THE PROCESSING UNITS? EXACTLY. SO THE EXPERIENCE WILL BE BETTER. WHEN YOUR PC IS FOUR YEARS OLD, TIME TO GET A NEW ONE AND YOU WILL WANT THE ONE THAT SPEEDS UP THE NEW CAPABILITIES AND INSIDE YOUR COMPANY, THEY WILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE -- THEY WILL WANT TO BUY A MACHINE THAT LASTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. ED: JENSEN, WHERE IS NVIDIA'S PLACE IN THE AI GAMING? DO YOU HAVE A PLACE IN THE A YA I PC -- IN THE AI PC? THERE ARE A BUNCH OF NVIDIA GPU'S IN DELL STATIONS. ALL OF OUR GP WAS HAVE THE SAME DENSER COURT -- TENSOR CORES. EVERY ONE OF OURS USES AI TO DO THE WORK. AI WILL TRANSFORM GAMING. ALL OF THE NONPLAYER CHARACTERS WILL BE CHATBOTS. CREATING WORLDS WILL BE EASIER. INSTEAD OF INSTRUCTION DRIVEN COMPUTING, IT IS IN ENSION DRIVEN COMPUTING SO IT IS EASIER TO WRITE PROGRAMS. --- PYTHON PROGRAMS WILL BE EVEN EASIER TO WRITE. ED: WHAT YOU DID WITH BLACKWELL AND OTHERS, YOU INNOVATED BY COMBINING GPU WITH CPU. HERE IS THE NVIDIA CPU THAT GOES WITH IT. WE WANT TO SUPPORT EVERY CPU THE WORLD MAKES. THERE ARE PLACES THAT HAVE X86. THERE ARE OTHERS THAT PURPLE -- PREFER ARM, WE SUPPORT ARM. WHEREVER IT MAKES SENSE, WE WILL SUPPORT THE RIGHT CPUS COME EVERY CPU. ED: LET'S TALK ABOUT THE U.S. LEADERSHIP SIDE OF THIS. THREE AMERICAN CEOS. IS THAT NEWS IN AND OF ITSELF THAT ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN, THEY ARE AMERICAN COMPANIES LEADING, MICHAEL DELL? MICHAEL: I'M NOT SURE IT IS NEWS. THE U.S. HAS BEEN LEADING IN INNOVATION FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BUT IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT THING FOR THE UNITED STATES. AND THE U.S. ECONOMY, TO HAVE GREAT COMPANIES LIKE NVIDIA, SERVICE NOW, MICROSOFT DRIVING INNOVATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY TO EFFICIENCY. THE WORLD REQUIRES THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENABLE EVERYTHING. E YOU TALKED ONSTAGE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE IN THE SPLY CHAIN. YOUR GLOBAL EXPERIENCE OF DOING BUSINESS. YOU SEE THIS TYPE O INVESTMENT IN EUROPE, LATIN AERICA, SOUTHEAST ASIA TAT YOU SEEIN THE U.S.? IT IS COMING. JENSN AND I SPEND A LOT F TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS AND HOW IT IS EXANDING OUT. YOUW AN EXAMPLE FROM SOUT KOREA ONSTAGE WITH SAMSUNG. YOU SEETHIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. YOU EE IT IN SOVEREIGN I'S BEING BUILT UP. AND FOR A COUNTRY TO ENCAPSULATE ITS OWN LTURE, LANGUAGE, BELIEFS, THAT IS HAPPENING IN EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ED: WE HAVE DISCUSSED SOVREIGN AI IN THE WORLDAND USING JAAN AS AN EXAMPL, I GO BACK TO MY QUEION ABOUTHE DURABILITY OF THE MARKET. SEEING A COMMITMENT AT THE NATINSTATLEVEL. IS TODAY'S NEWS AND INDCATION THAT THAT HAS HPENED BECAUS OF AI FACTORIES R ARE THEY RUNNING TO SPARATE PHS? NO COUNTRYCAN AFFORD TO OUTSOURC ITS IELLIGENCE ON FIRST PRINCIPLES. EVRY COUNTRYHAS ITS OWN NATIVE NATURA RESOURCE ALLEDIT LGUAGE, CULTURE OR IELLIGENCE. PEOPLE REALIZE THAT BECAUSE THR COUNTIES DAA A PART OF THEIR NATURAL RESOURCE, NOT JUST COPPER MINES, GOLD, LITHIUM OR WHEVER, IT IS ALO -- THE DATA IS SO PART OF THEIR NATURAL RESOURCE NDTHEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HARNESS THE NATURAL RESOURCE AND TRANSLATE IT AND TNSFR ITTO ARTICAL INTELLIGENCE.
