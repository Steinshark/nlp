Awakening Intensive Lisbon LEAVE EVERYTHING and Stay Empty 4 April 2024 [Questioner] Namaste Mooji. [Q.] I'm so grateful to be here today. I'm sure there's some divine will for me to be heard in your presence, [Q.] to acknowledge that. [Q.] And, I've only been practising [Mooji] Yes. [Q.] I've experienced the state of beingness. [Q.] It's beautiful. [Q.] My ego doesn't show up. [Q.]It's blissful. [Q.] But in the moments that it's not there, [M.] When you forgot what? [M.] The beingness? If you say, 'When the beingness is here No ego is showing up. But when it is not there ...' So there must be Take a moment. Even beingness. What is beingness? The sense of presence. The place of intuition, beyond ego. That which witnesses ego and the world. Then you say, 'But when it is not there ...' Is it that the mind comes again? Or what? [Q.] Yeah. I'm outside that frame of reference. I'm in the frame of my mind. [Mooji] Ah, OK. [Q.] Yeah, I'm in the frame of my mind. [Q.] Then my ego shows up. [Q.] All my idiosyncrasies show up. [Q.] But the experience of beingness [Mooji] Yes. [Q.] My ego wants to make that about itself. [Mooji] Yes. [Q.] And it's a hindrance for me [Mooji] Yes. [Q.] Because I feel like I have to go back to that standard of something beautiful there ... [Mooji] OK, so let's do something. The mind is visible. The ego is visible. And its world of personhood, of all of this, is visible. So let's leave that aside for a moment, Say, 'OK'. Put it aside. They are watched from, let's say, They are observed, you see, You may call it the sense of beingness. But you said something very interesting. You said, 'Sometimes, then the mind comes'. What about if the mind is put aside, and even the sense of beingness ... If it comes and goes, [Q.] Yes. [Mooji] So let's put them over there. OK? So the option is not the mind or beingness. [Mooji] The mind and beingness also can leave. [Mooji] Don't invent a thought now. Any thought you go to Beingness itself So even the subtlety of beingness, the sense or the intuition, 'I exist' ... You see, in the morning, and you just 'are'. Even your memory of being a person Sometimes you may experience that. And then maybe the alarm clock goes off ... And you're triggered back So that somebody arises. Also, the sense of beingness, the awareness of being alive, also comes. In the phenomenal waking state, Then out of that OK, please, you can do it. If I say, that which comes and goes; there's the mind, ego, a personal self, If it's something that comes and goes, And don't touch any thought. What is here that would say, I say, don't worry. Beingness, the sense of, 'I am, I exist', is itself, phenomenal. It's more subtle than the mind Nevertheless, it's there. So if the sense of a person fades, or comes and goes out of focus, then the beingness that perceives the person, If it comes and goes ... he's a tourist. Then what remains? [Mooji] Bear it. Bear it for a minute. Please take this. Follow this. You have given me a wonderful opportunity Because we can come so far from the phenomenal world of personhood, Then we're looking from the place of beingness, It is just the functioning consciousness, Then you say that OK, then leave all of them. So now what? What remains now? And don't pick up a thought about it! [Mooji] Do you exist? [Q.] Only as nothing. [Q.] Only as nothing. [Mooji] Is that a derogatory description? [Q.] I feel it ... [Mooji] Is it an experience, even? Slow down, slow down. This is wonderful, that we're having this talk. The sense of the person, the person's world, you may call it ego and so on, you've left aside for a moment The attention has moved, from the sense, or the intuition, 'I exist', Then you say, Ah! Oh! Leave him also then. Leave them. Then what remains? And don't invent another concept. Don't put it into words. Is it describable or definable? [Q.] It's present. [Mooji] It's present. It's here. Did it come? [Q.] I think it was always there. [Mooji] I who thinks it was always there [Q.] Again, the subtle 'I'. [Mooji] Does that which we are referring to depend upon the subtle 'I' to speak up for it? [Q.] No. [Mooji] Are you lost? [M.] Even the sense of being lost [M.] is merely a sensation believed in, Maybe because the mind cannot explain this. Who are you now? Is it valid? Have we gone too far? Is there suffering here? You use the term 'nothing'. I say, this 'nothing', is it a dirty word? [Q.] No. [Q.] It's nothing, but still, [M.] Yes. It's nothing! Is it having to control everything? [Q.] No. [Mooji] Have you made a big mistake? [Q.] No. [laughs] [Mooji] Are you confused? [Q.] Not confused. [M.] You want to know how to live? [Q.] Be in that space and live every day. Be in the space of my nothingness and still go through everything in life [Mooji] Who's speaking now? [Q.] Yeah. [nods and laughs] [Mooji] I want to meet the one who does nothing, who has to keep doing nothingness. So it only calls for ... You see we're running now ... Techniques are for the person, for the mind, even for the sense of beingness ... But these are redundant now. Are you dead? Are you here still? And if you are, as what? And you answered, But I said, As what? What is that? You said, 'Like a kind of everything-nothing?' You said, 'Ah, yes. It feels good.' Then comes the response, now, 'Yes. What do I have to do [Mooji] Where does this thought come from? [Q.] It's from the ego. [Mooji] From the ego, from the mind, Can you bear it? That's why I ask, Have we gone too far? We've actually left the room? Don't ask the mind how you are. I just want to see, because there is some seemingly existential fear to go beyond 'Let's surf in the realm of the knowable. We can compare and do and change and grow.' But now, beyond this, also. Not beyond like over the rainbow, but beyond in terms of subtlety. Now language is not credible here. Language wants to create more concepts about it. But it's before concepts. Before even the intuition Which means I can also not exist. So earlier than that! 'I exist', or, 'I don't exist', So the question comes, Who is asking this question? Is it relevant to This? Have we made a wrong turn? 'Oh, Babaji, what have you done to me?' [sangha laugh] You're going to find out now, how your consciousness and mind function, and see they're just playing, just playing. They're happening. But we are also able to experience But that Self will not run into trouble! Because the parent of that Self Is this just words? [Mooji] Is it just another highfalutin concept? Have you made a mistake [Questioner shakes head 'no'] [Q.] I think this will really help me to know what is the sense of 'I' [Q.] and what is truly 'I', the Beingness. [Q.] I think that differentiation ... [Mooji] Yes. So just remind me, [Q.] Being able, in my practice, [M.] The one who practises? OK. [M.] So the one who practises, is also seen? [Mooji] It's subtle. I'm not throwing it away. But why you say 'practise' is because, this discovery has not happened before. And it feels like it is someone's discovery. And this someone is feeling, I must not forget this emptiness, nothingness.' [laughter] [Mooji] It's a paradox. But it's very important. Something needs to sit with that. The familiar sense of self 'I must make use of this practice', Because if not, we slip back into the usual ... 'Oh, I'm having a bad day today. I don't know what I'm going to do. [solitary laugh in the sangha] [Mooji] I like that laughter. [Mooji] It is like the laughter that must have come from the child [laughter] I didn't hear it as a child. Yes, they say Made out of the best material in the whole world. And so he asked the finest tailors, 'Make this robe for me. So they tried to stitch They got silk from China. They made it and the king said, So in the end, they thought about it, they're going to make a garment out of nothing. It's going to be so refined that nobody can see it. [laughter] [Mooji] So they go to work Well, I don't know if But they went to the king and said, 'Your Majesty, But we have done it! We've made the most incredible gown! There's nothing like it! It's so ... that the senses cannot perceive it!' The king said, So they said, 'OK, fine'. He said, 'I want to try it on!' 'I want to wear it for my people today So they said, 'Yes, your Majesty!' Then they said because his clothes So he took off everything. And they said, 'OK, your Majesty'. And then they blew the trumpet. All the people ... The king walks out and everybody They say, 'It is so wonderful! And his Majesty is feeling very, very happy. And some little boy looked and said, 'The king is naked.' 'I can see his willy and everything.' And the father [nudged and hushed him]. So it must be ... Because you say, 'I must do this', and it is true. We have to, for a while, And what happens is, The one who is trying to see and evaluate the limitless, itself is limited, [Mooji] Have we gone too far? [Mooji to questioner] Have you gone too far? [Q.] I think I've gone where I need to go. [laughter] [Mooji] Which is where? [Q.] This clarity of being able to differentiate that sense of 'I' [M.] Because, nevertheless, I say it like that. This exercise that you speak about ... Who was speaking about the exercise? Just two days ago, before coming here, we were preparing It was coming out like that. So they said, 'Maybe make it into So quickly, quickly, I have a beautiful team, they did it so that you could read it now. So there is an exercise that must be done. Why? Because there's a reflex to keep going back to And we have to acknowledge that, and seeing how that is created. And something just naturally cancels out the tangibility of this identity. Don't speak about it This work you must do alone. Don't go to a restaurant You alone came here. Maybe your family didn't come, You came alone. [Q.] Yes. Yes. [Mooji] Don't evaluate. Just stay put. And you will see that you don't put a marker, a measure, As you move, somehow, it just becomes more clear. And the mind's energy, above, even, the sense of beingness, will subside into it's natural birthplace to harmonize in beingness, [Mooji] I can call it 'Heart-mind'. Thank you.
