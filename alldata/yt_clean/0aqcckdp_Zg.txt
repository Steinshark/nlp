I've had the new Nikon 35 mm 1.4 with me for about a week now and during this time I've tested it thoroughly and compared it with the older less fast but more expensive 35 mm 1.8s and I'm pretty confused but also quite impressed but let's get started I'm David you are watching Division and let's [Music] go if you enjoy the video remember to like subscribe and hit the bell and feel free to check out my Instagram as well fast 35 mm lenses are my absolute favorite prime lenses which is why I was initially so excited about canons 35 1.4 only to be quite disappointed with the performance at the given price Nikon's 35 1.4 is quite different with a price of only EUR 730 it doesn't set the bar nearly as high as Canon the price is even lower than the 870 that Nikon wants for its own 35 mm 1.8s but this land is part of Nikon's sine which marks higher quality lenses the 35 1.4 doesn't have such a designation but at first Clans the inclined buyer might still think that the 35 1.4 is of a higher quality and better than the one with just aperture of 1.8 aside from the price both lenses are very very similar there's only about a millimeter difference in length and diameter separating these two lenses and the filter thread remains at the same 62 mm the 1.4 is about 45 G heavier through but not heavy at all with just over 400 G both have top-notch build quality the 1.8 has a metal housing and metal Focus ring while the 1.4 is made of plastic but that doesn't feel less of high quality in fact I consider the plastic Focus ring an advantage since the paint of the 1.8 can wear off as you see here with this model what 1.4 unfortunately lacks is a switch between AF an MF which is bit annoying but unlike the 1.8 it has a customizable function ring I really appreciate that even this extremely affordable 35 1.4 lens has a sealed design making it resistant to splashes and dust but remember a lens is only sealed with a front filter the 1.8 is also sealed but it's part of the S serious and you wouldn't expect to get a cheap lens with dust and splash resistance for Canon for example except in their L line optically both lenses have 11 elements in nine groups and nine rounded aperture blades so nothing super complex and no gimmicks with the aperture the reproduction scale is also very very similar for both lenses with a minimum focusing distance of 25 cm for the 1.8 and 27 CM for the 1.4 you won't get impressive semi macro shots out of these lenses but the shallow thata field is very pleasant but let's see how the these lenses perform and wherever there's any justification 41.8 now and not just 41.4 but we will see and when it comes to sharpness it becomes clear why this lens is so cheap at f1.4 it's anything but sharp it's really really soft really blurry even in the center it has a retro lens feel and doesn't look good next to the 1.8 version okay the 35 1.8 isn't perfect either especially at the Corner sharpness but it's much better than the 1.4 to achieve similar sharpness in the center and at the edges you have to stop down the 1.4 version to f2.8 the 1.8 version also improves significantly in Edge sharpness when stopped down to 2.8 but both lenses remain similar in the center at this point the pore sharpness isn't just visible in my test subject shots but in almost every portrait I've taken with this lens and of course of course these were only taken with the Standard 24 megapixel of the Z ZX 3 not with pixel shift like the test shots even in other test shots I've taken it's considerably noticeable that below f2.0 there isn't anything sharp with this lens but there are other factors for evaluating a lens like chromatic aberations the 35 1.8s has several elements in its design to counteract this the 1.4 doesn't but looking at my branches against the sky test charts I see little to no lateral CA the color edges on contrast borders are very well corrected but Lightroom also tells me Nikon has applied a built-in correction profile in the raw files I don't mind this because it doesn't affect the image quality what also stands out in the images are the color fringing in the foreground and background plur also known as longitudinal CA or Loca there are plenty of these with bu lenses and in my opinion even more at the 1.8 lens you can also see how much sharper the 1.8 is here however it could also be that the general blurriness of the 1.4 conceals the loc car in this situation both aren't great at all but at least with the 35 1.4 you get rid of the locer stopping stopping down to like say f2.8 with the 35 1.8s there are still noticeable low at 2.8 I also subjected both lenses to a brief coma test and if astrophotography is a concern for you you are much better off with the 35 1.8 the 1.4 struggles significantly with coma where Point light sources outside of the image Center becomes comat shaped that's why we call it coma but when it comes to Boke it's a completely different story The Boke ofd 35 1.4 is far superior than the one of the 1.8s version the 1.8s struggles with somewhat messy bokeh circles no onion rings but Restless texture in the Bokus circles the 1.4 doesn't have this the Bokus circles are super clear clean neat and exactly what I would expect from a modern 35 1.4 unlike what Canon calls Boke in their 35 1.4 vcm and there are no Cat's eyes at all outside of the image Circle which is impressively good and completely different from the 1.8s and also from the Canon 35 1.4 vcm what is much more expensive in practice both lenses have a very pleasing nice background out of fukus performance I took the 35 1.8s on vacation to Portugal and took many family photos and I find it very very pleasant and calm and has a nice Boke in practice the 35 1.4 in practice has a lot of charm in the boui then it's not so clean yes it has more of a retro lens wipe like with the sharpness which I don't find bad at all in this case it has a special look you can call it somewhat Restless especially in the trans transition from sharp to blurred areas although there isn't really any sharp area here at f1.4 but at least this lens doesn't cost EUR2,000 so so what's the matter here it's nice when it comes to Distortion you can again see where the cost were cut the 35 1.4 has a built-in correction profile that cannot be disabled in Lightroom but there are other ways to see it and there's a quite significant Distortion which shouldn't be necessary for a 35 mm prime lens but we also have seen exactly this in a EUR2,000 Canon lens the 35 1.8s on the other hand is almost Distortion free thanks to the buil-in profile you won't see any Distortion even shooting raw video with the Nikon 35 1.4s lens because unlike Canon Nikon bakes the Distortion correction file directly into the N raw container but I still don't like this digital trickery of image manipulation so you have no Distortion vignetting at the other hand isn't corrected by a profile and here the 1.4 performs significantly better than the 1.8s at f1.8 you get almost black cornors even though no Distortion correction is needed here which might crop the corners out but that's without any correction and it's nearly black the 1.4 is much more pleasant in terms of this of the vignetting offers a notable but attractive vignetting that would probably look really really nice in wide open aperture portrait shots what I was really curious about how good will be the backlit the flare performance the ghosting performance with this cheap lens and in this case the 1.8s has a nanotexture coating on the lenses to prevent flares to prevent ghosting to give a better backlit performance but in my tests it was worse not maybe in terms of ghosting it's okay they both show some ghosting with the light source directly in the frame that's not out of the world it's not very unpleasant it doesn't look as bad as with the Canon lens mentioned but flares are a different story for flares I also tested this with my usual flashlight test and the flaring of the 1.8s looks really really much much worse than the flares you get out of the 1.4 lenses when you shine the light source from the side into the lens and that was really strange since I thought the nanotexture coating was to prevent such things but the cheaper lens is better in this case but buff lenses are very very good when it comes to sunstars both produce exceptionally welll looking sunstars with the nine rounded aperture plates and I really really like the sunstars coming out of these lenses now we need to talk about the autofocus first of all it's nice that the lens doesn't rattle which is worth mentioning these days I think however the autof focal speed of the 1.4 is is for me probably the biggest weakness of the lens focusing from one point to another point in other distance takes noticeably longer with the 1.4 something I haven't experienced with any other Nikon lens before not even with a cheap wheel TR lens which I think focuses faster than the new 35 1.4 this means the 1.4 is might struggle to keep up with faster moving subject in front of it so it might be not suitable with its limitations for playing children for sports or for dog portraits everything that moves fast maybe the autofocus is not fast enough for this the 35 1.8s is significantly faster in terms of autofocus tracking speed and following the subject it's quicker and so you are less likely to encounter issues when you are shooting faster moving subjects you can barely hear the autofocus of the 1.4 maybe if you hold your ear against the lens you can hear it but not in practice in contrast you don't hear anything from the 1.8s and that's one of the biggest differentiators between the two lenses what is also very important for me with 35 mm lens is the video use I shoot all of my talking head here in the studio with 35 mm lens and I've already filmed a few videos with the 35 mm 1.4 and now it's also filmed for video the autofocus isn't a problem at all since you want smooth Focus transitions even with autofocus and the lens that focuses a bit slower than another isn't the problem at all for video and you don't hear the autofocus of the 1.4 during video either because it's acting slower and then you don't hear it as much Nikon advertised the lens as being Focus breathing free but unfortunately that's not true the lens clearly shows Focus bre everything I would say it's very very well controlled and nice and in practice it's not a problem at all with this lens but you can see it and if you can see it it's not focus briefing free incidentally the 1.8s shows the same amount of completely acceptable Focus briefing so for video use you have a good choice with both of them in the end the Nikon 35 1.4 is by no means an exceptionally good lens that can be recommended without any reservations it has it its Optical limitations yeah especially regarding the sharp lens if you want a sharp lens wide open it's not for you however there are also some points where it outperforms the more expensive and slower 1.8s version both lenses are in practice a lot of fun to use the 1.8 is cleaner some might say it's more sterile while the 1.4 is more playful has a bit of a retro feel and charm and some character to it especially with the bokei bu lenses are very suitable for video and the 35 1.4 will often be attached to my Nikon set 63 from now on filming videos here in my studio for you absolute image sharpness isn't necessary for video and I really really like the look it's pretty much the kind of 35 mm 1.4 I would have wished for from another manufacturer as well but yeah that that's it it's relatively affordable it's small it's compact it has a decent performance not the best it's quite good for video as well it's not perfect but for EUR 730 it doesn't have to be that means I will keep it and I'm almost certainly most of you will enjoy it to for Nikon cameras if you find the lens interesting and its features convincing you find links to all the lens under the video in the video description down below I will also link the 35 1.8s there because when it comes to the best image sharpness in a 35 mm for Nikon the the 1.4 doesn't hold up but the 1.8s version isn't perfect either you have to consider what you value more but let me know how you would decide 1.4 or 1.8s feel free to write it in the
