This time we will tell the story of Mr. Haji Abral's grave which was filled with thousands of terrible snakes. Even though during his life Mr. Haji Abral was known as a pious figure and diligent in worship, this story teaches us important lessons about life, but before that, take the time to write a greeting in the comments column so that the comments become witnesses. we will get intercession from the Messenger of Allah later in the afterlife Amen Fajar Just broke on the eastern horizon when the sound of the dawn call to prayer mah keningan Sumberjo village as usual Pak Abralan has been in the mosque since 15 minutes before Aanuduk dif terpan said Allahu akbar Pak abralulaiatuh berah with his melodious voice lead After tens of hours, no one expected that the takbir would be his last takb. Right after Salamaju Kitueng Abradar AB , hundreds of mourners came to fill the courtyard and terrace of his funeral home. He never missed congregational prayers at the mosque, recalled Mr. Karman. The neighbor next door, every evening, the sound of his recitation of the Koran played melodiously. from the Timal Buauah mosque speaker, the wife of the RT head. This deceased was very generous. Every time a neighbor was in trouble, he would definitely help me when my child was sick last year. He was the one who lent me the money for medical treatment. Added to that, the child's absence m his father's suit.

Next to him were three other diggers. Sarman Tono and Bambang joined in. Swinging a hoe with a regular rhythm. Thank God the ground wasn't too loud, Murmurono wiped his sweat , but his words were soon swallowed by the tense silence that followed. Only half the depth had been dug when something unexpected happened. Oh my god, Sarman shouted, jumping backwards until he tripped over the exposed ground. A black snake writhed out, its scales glistening. wet in the drizzle, calm down, said Mr. Karto, trying to calm the situation. Mes, cold sweat started to drip down his wrinkled forehead . He was paraded as if he wanted to immediately complete this terrifying task. Mr. Hai Abral's body , wrapped in a white shroud, began to be lowered into the grave, but just as the body touched the ground, something even more frightening happened. The ground around the grave shook violently, causing vibrations that could be felt up to a radius of several meters. O Allah, several mourners screamed when dozens of snakes of various sizes suddenly appeared from various gaps in the ground around the grave, some as small as an arm, some as big as an adult's arm, chaos broke out instantly. Lailahaillallah, someone from the crowd shouted, retreating according to the village head's orders, his face was white, several people ran. leaving the burial area stumbling on the wet ground the women screamed in fear holding each other but in the midst of the panic the 70 year old Village Imam who led the procession remained standing in his place even though his body was shaking violently Kia Fauzan forced himself to continue the funeral prayer his voice was shaking violently his tasbih His hands trembled in rhythm with his trembling body. Ahmad, son of Mr Ha Abral, stood transfixed watching the terrible scene, but Tan now looked like a kert beside him , his grave was always in the middle , his hands trembled and he dug Li's grave - a strange appearance emerged. Their scales glistened in the gloomy light, creating a sight that was at once frightening and mesmerizing. Mr. Kiai whispered the village head after the dumping was finished. His trembling hand held the Kiai's shoulder. I have never seen something like this in my life leading Kia Fauzan Village. He was silent for a moment. His wise eyes looked at the tomb which was now closed perfectly surrounded by dozens of snakes that are still crawling, no one knows, Allah, Mr. Lurah, but sometimes there are signs that Allah gives to open our eyes. The rain starts to fall more heavily, wetting the cloths covering the heads of the remaining mourners, but no one moves their eyes. focused on the eerie sight in front of them, a new tomb guarded by a herd of snakes as if it held a big secret that had not yet been revealed. In the distance, lightning flashed, illuminating the frightened faces of the mourners. For a moment, the whispers began to sound again, this time louder than before. The sun had just risen. When Mr. Karto, the grave guard, carried out his routine inspection in the morning, his steps stopped a few meters from the grave of Mr. Haji Abral Sofyan. The sight before him made the hairs on the back of his neck bristle. Tens of snakes were still loyally circling the grave area. The number had even increased from yesterday. The village head must know this, he muttered as he hurried to leave the cemetery area an hour later. Then the village head together with several village officials came to check. Oh Allah, sighed the village head. I thought yesterday's incident was just a coincidence. I tried to get rid of it this morning, Mr. Karto explained, but it's no use. They always seem to be calling on the third day after the funeral. The situation is getting more and more astonishing. Hundreds of snakes of various sizes. The burial area looks like some are as big as an adult's arm. The color of their scales varies, black, brown, gray, shiny in the sunlight. This is not normal. Kia Fa, who was brought in for this melatenom, has been taking care of these snakes for 30 years now. This is how I carry out every snake that is caught and moved always. returned to the grave in a matter of hours. Strangely enough, these snakes are not aggressive, said Mr. Danu from the Forestry Service. They don't attack humans. They just roam around the grave as if they were guarding something. A week after the burial, the situation reached its peak. Thousands of snakes had filled the area of Mr. Abral's grave. The sight was so squeamish that it was unbearable. Even if anyone dares to approach the area within a radius of 50 m, the surrounding graves are forced to be unable to visit these snakes, as if on a mission, Mrs. Rauzah whispered to her neighbors while peering from a distance, see the way they circle the graves like a guard, various efforts to expel them have been tried. from modern methods using poison and traps to traditional methods using incense and rituals, but none of them succeeded, even when several snakes were successfully destroyed, the number of new ones appeared, the strangest thing was, said Sarman, one of the grave diggers. These snakes only focused on Pak Ha's grave. Other tombs were not touched at all. Kia Fauzan was often seen standing from a distance observing this phenomenon with bright eyes. One afternoon when asked for his opinion he simply said that Allah never sends signs without meaning. Maybe there is something we need to know about the deceased. The news about the snake tomb started spread to neighboring villages, some local journalists even came to cover the story, but no one dared to get too close to take pictures. The amateur videos circulating on social media gave rise to various speculations, with people hearing about it in coffee shops. No one knows for sure. but everyone felt that there was a big secret that was trying to emerge to the surface at the Bumin coffee shop where people usually gather. The afternoon chat felt more serious than usual. It's been two weeks. The snakes are still there. Mr. Tono said while stirring his coffee which was starting to get cold. There's definitely something going on. Akahanur which was called bijand without meaning. Meanwhile at the village head's house, the village elders gathered in an emergency deliberation. The living room, which was usually quiet, was now filled with important village figures, namely Kiai Fauzan, a former village official from the 0s era and several other elders. I remember the time when Pak Haji Abral served as village head. Mr. Darto, the former village secretary, opened the discussion carefully in 1990. Mr. Wahid added that after serving as village head, suddenly his family became very well off, built a big house, bought a new car and went on Haj. Abral, finally he was called Pak Haji Abral Sofyan. Bumin, who was asked to prepare treats for the deliberation, overheard In the conversation that night in his shop, whispers began to spread, he said that when he was village head, there was a lot of village funds that were not clear, Bisikor Peli, it's appropriate, yes, the other one, I'm inatulu, his house, so he's a village head . Diumahak Abralumah became Head of Dij Village, Mr. Imam said that he was diligent in praying diligently in reciting the Koran, but if there was really something wrong with his property, that was Kiai Fauzan who happened to be passing by. Sometimes we forget that worship is not only about prayer and fasting but also about honesty, trust and responsibility. It's late but the village seems unable to sleep. In every corner, whispers continue to circulate, while in the cemetery, thousands of snakes remain faithfully circling Mr. Ha Abral's grave, as if forcing a truth that has been hidden for a long time to immediately come to the surface. Maybe Mr. Wahid said that one night the snakes is a reminder from Allah that there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed. 3 weeks after Mr. Susri's funeral, the former village treasurer in the 0s, finally had the courage to speak. His vulnerable body, now 75 years old, was shaking when facing the village head and the village elders. I can no longer stand it. holding this burden, he said in a trembling voice. For 30 years, I have kept this secret. Maybe the snakes were God's warning so that the truth would be revealed in the dimly lit living room of the village head. Mr. Susri took out an old book from his bag. This is the original village financial record for 1994. S4 desaend halami page diuka menilkankaangkakanunatar get someone to ask lakek jan the essay is the funds Sep so our house is my school everything yes son Mr Susri nodded sadly even your father's Haj Abral departure was all from the Village's money but how did he not get caught? Asked the Head of the Village, the financial report was always made in clear duplicate Mr Susri said while showing this other original document which was reported to a different center, there were dozens of fictitious projects which were reported to have been completed , even though they were never completed, even Dian's aid funds for the poor were not spared . who was unable to hold back his sadness and disappointment during his 10 year term of office, Mr. Susri continued that there was almost no significant development in this village even though funds had decreased quite a bit. Now I understand why Allah sent thousands of snakes, snakes that were in the Community Health Center which were just a plan, and suddenly became able to do it. Hajj Abral Danapat Gar Pak Abral whispered R from Ang Rakyatara that at the snake's grave, he curled his grave, thousands of times, remembering the size of his plate, now he understood that every corner of the house was built with the tears of the people, every floor was covered with other people's rights and titles. Mr. Hai Abral What his father was carrying was the result of a betrayal of trust. A month after the truth was revealed, scholars from various villages gathered at the mosque to learn lessons from this incident. Kiai Fauzan led the discussion with a sad face. This incident he opened the discussion on was a reminder from Allah that ritual worship is only It is not enough for someone to be diligent in going to the mosque and smoothly reciting the Koran and even having completed the Hajj abrala Diang with the same morals that he can- In the afterlife, hopefully this will be a lesson for all of us, said Kiai Faan, ending that the honesty of a leader is more valuable than all ritual worship and that Allah is all-seeing and nothing is hidden from him. After the meeting, the villagers went home with a new understanding of the thousands of snakes that were still faithfully circling the grave. now seen as an eternal reminder that the people's trust is a sacred trust and betraying it is a sin that cannot be forgiven by mere rituals of worship. Hopefully we can learn from this story. Thank you wasalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
