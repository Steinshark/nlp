Oh, that was a good one. Oh, okay, okay. Well done. Now it's my turn. With the tennis balls or first with the big balls? - Uh... What do you think? - Ouch. Okay, let's see. - Okay. Oh. Celine is treated like a pro today. She's just in the area of a pro and she's treated like a pro. - You ready? Okay. Very good. Very good. This is my challenge. I feel it. Okay, no points. Oh! Yeah, okay, okay. No points, no points. So the next challenge is clap or out. - So when I do this... - Oh, you know this game. - Okay, okay. You ready? - Good clap. I had to clap. - Not bad.

BLOCK THE BALL - You will throw a ball and I have to block it. DISTANCE 1 Okay. DISTANCE 2 Hey, secret skills. I'm getting better and better. - But we're a team or not? DISTANCE 3 - Ready? - It was against the tree, sorry. Okay. - Oh. Okay, I think you can throw very hard. DISTANCE 3 That was dirty. Was it? No. - It's good, it's good. Now, let's see. Ready? DISTANCE 1 DISTANCE 2 That was very high. Sorry. We need a smaller tree... DISTANCE 3 DISTANCE 4 - Do I stand here? Okay. Yes, sorry Court. Sorry. My bad. Celine at throwing is not very good. I'm just wondering what Thibaut thinks. Thibaut, how much do you rate Celine's throwing skills? Uh, not bad. - Not bad? Oh, thank you. 7. Oh, that's high. - That's high. At the moment, at the moment. It can go up or it can go down. Well done. - Well done. 6. Who is faster? So, five ball reaction game. - Hands like here. The balls need to be in a straight line. - Oh, yeah. - Why? Uh, in my mind it's not correct. For the video. - Oh, you're standing like this. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Yes. No! Yes! No! - Oh... Sorry. Yes! No! Yes! No! Yes! - Oh, no!!! Too good. Too good. Well done. Yeah, the wrong technique because you did like this instead of like this. - Oh, really? - Ooh! Yes! No!!! So, I did like... this. - Yeah. Yeah, that's because it looks like I win every time. The last one you were close, but because you did like this. Okay. - Okay. - Just 1 now? Yes! - But his hands are... - Okay, but thanks for the tip. - The reflexes are there. Of course, they are there. - But you did well, I think. - Yeah. Also, I'm very proud of you. And now, I just want to make one video. It's like a Short where I can test how tall I am next to you. - Is that okay for you? - No worries. You know your stats of reflexes on EA FC? - 90 or something? But then my kicking, they didn't change since 2011. - It stays the same. - Really? But now, it's just like this. - But better like this than like this. I kick the ball to the other side and it's still 76. Still-- Oh yeah. But sometimes, they are so wrong. Yes. - Wait, again. Yes. - Okay. MAN Very nice. - The heights will be added later. No, no. It's funny. *FULL SHORTS ON YOUTUBE OR INSTAGRAM* So, that was it. - Are you ready for it? - That's for you. - Yeah, because... ...you're the best goalkeeper in the world. Thank you. - Perfect. Thank you. Okay, okay. Attention, please. If you want to win this shirt signed by Courtois, then go to my Instagram for all the info. Good luck! MAN - One more thing. Now, we are walking to the pool. Thibaut, I just want to see you doing a challenge against Celine. - Celine knows it already. So, the person who can name the most goalkeepers wins. So, if you are like, hmm, and it takes too long, the loser gets pushed in the pool. How do you know that I will win? No, I don't know if you will win. - No. - Okay, but if Celine knows more goalkeepers... - She knows a lot, eh. She plays FIFA. - That's why I'm afraid. She knows a many. Who can name more goalkeepers? Courtois. It's my turn now? Buffon. - Ter Stegen. - Neuer. Buffon. I said Buffon. &quot;I said Buffon.&quot; What am I doing? - That was fun. - Buffon two times. I was sleeping. Oh, thank you. I said Buffon! Oh, wow, I was not focused. MAN Yeah, it was fine. I was satying to Thibaut, &quot;Celine knows all the players.&quot; - Yeah. Like, you named two players? - Yeah, I think so. - Neuer. And Buffon. - Yeah, I said Buffon. I said Buffon and... So you had three right and one wrong. - Not focused, you know. Then when you start, it's really like, I know we see a lot of goalkeepers, but then suddenly you're like, uh, error. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. - Thank you, Thibaut, for everything. - Wish you all the best. Thank you. Sorry. - No worries. SUBSCRIBE!!! What did you do with Thibaut Courtois? Unboxing gloves.
