DOUG: THERE IS GREAT JOY IN HEAVEN WHEN A WERE YOU. WHEN THAT SINNER IS LOST AND IS JOY. OUR GUESTS CAME TO KNOW THAT JOY AFTER FRUSTRATION, WHICH SHE CAPTURES IN HER THE FOUNDER OF RAMP, AND WELLKNOWN KAREN: SO GOOD TO SEE YOU JONI: TOO GOOD TO SEE YOU. KAREN: I'M ALIVE. I'M OLD. JONI: I DON'T THINK YOU GETTING, OH PLEASE. KAREN: I KNOW BETTER. I SAW THE MIRROR JONI: NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU DOING MINISTRY? THE RAMP. THEY'RE IN KAREN: MANCHESTER, ENGLAND. THAT'S RIGHT, THE RAMP. STILL GOING. GOING TO GO TILL JONI: ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT YOU HAVE THIS HAPPEN WITH YOUR DAUGHTER LINDSAY, WHICH HOPEFULLY SHE'LL BE ABLE TO COME BE WITH US BUT OF COURSE PEOPLE REMEMBER KAREN SINGING SHE'S SANG AT TBN, SHE'S SANG ON ALL REALLY OH WELL, MAYBE SHE IS JUST SINGING KAREN: OH MY. [MUSIC] JONI: ALL RIGHT. GOING BACK THERE YOU SING, SING SOME GREAT BIG SONGS. I MEAN, KAREN: WOULD YOU BELIEVE PROBABLY DOUG: YOU DON'T COUNT AFTER THAT, THAT'S GOOD. JONI: NO, KNOW YOU STARTED WHEN YOU KAREN: THANK YOU, JONI, THANK YOU. JONI: WELL, WE COULD THERE'S SO MUCH YOU AND I, BOTH, YOU SAW MY KAREN: I READ IT LAST NIGHT IN MY ROOM. JONI: YOU DID? KAREN: I WAS SO TOUCHED BY THE STORY BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S BEEN IN A STORM AND JONI: THAT'S RIGHT. KAREN: AND IT WILL GIVE YOU HOPE. JONI: AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY PARTS OF YOUR STORY I COULD WE WANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON YOUR KIDS TODAY. WITH KIDS THAT ARE AWAY FROM THE LORD DOUG: ABSOLUTELY, YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A GRANDMOTHER FROM THE LORD, YOUR HEART'S BROKEN, YOUR MOM THEY'RE BREAKING YOUR HEART YOU KNOW, AND I KNOW WALK THROUGH THAT. SO, KIND OF SHARE SOME OF JONI: WATCHING THE ROAD. WERE YOU KAREN: WELL, FOR SEVERAL YEARS ABSOLUTELY. AND IN THIRD JOHN 4 THAT SAYS, "I HAVE NO GREATER JOY OPPOSITE OF THAT IS TRUE, THERE'S NO GREATER WILL OF GOD FOR THEIR LIFE AND THEY'RE WALKING AS A CHRISTIAN PARENT I NEVER KNOWN PAIN LIKE OF DEEP OF DEEP PAIN AND STORM BUT WHEN OF GOD FOR HER LIFE, LEFT HER HUSBAND, MOVED TO A DIFFERENT CITY AND BECAME A DIFFERENT JONI: SO, TELL US KIND OF WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT WENT DOWN WHEN DID YOU FIND KAREN: WELL, BY THE TIME I FOUND OUT SUBTLE CHANGES IN LINDSAY THAT I COULDN'T CHARACTERISTIC OF WHO I KNEW HER TO BE. MARRIAGE IN HER MIND WAS OVER AND SHE DOUG: THAT'S THE WAY PRODIGAL GO. BECAUSE I'VE PARENTS GO THROUGH, BUT OFTEN TIMES THERE'S BE IT SEXUALITY, BE IT ABUSE, BE IT ADDICTIONS, ON THE SECRET WORLD BEFORE THE FRUIT EVEN IN THE PRODIGAL SON STORY, THE BROTHER RIGHT? SO, THERE WAS A SECRET THING THAT KAREN: THAT'S RIGHT. SO, WITH LINDSAY, HURT FROM HER PAST THAT OPENED THE DOOR TO HER BOOK "THE WAY HOME" OF AN EMOTIONAL AFFAIR THAT DECEIVED INTO THINKING THAT THE THIS PATH EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW EVERYTHING, SHE'D EVER JONI: WELL, THAT'S WHAT DECEPTION DOES. KAREN: DECEPTION WORKS DEED, YES. JONI: PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE DECEIVED, A RIGHTEOUS CAUSE AND BE TOTALLY DECEIVED OR FEEL KAREN: YES, THAT'S TRUE. JONI: SO, OKAY SO, YOU FOUND OUT TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT PROCESS. CAUSE I I DO WANT TO SAY RIGHT NOW, IF YOU KAREN'S GOING TO PRAY AT THE END OF THE THAT PRODIGAL TO GOD AND YOU'RE TRUSTING THAT YOU CAN BE IN RIGHT NOW. BUT JUST TELL US KAREN: IN THE BEGINNING, ULTIMATELY MY BEGAN TO FOCUS THERE WAS NO OTHER THING TO TO MY DAUGHTER. CAN ANYTHING BE DONE? AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT I REMEMBER WELL-MEANING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUST ACCEPT THIS AND YOU TOO. BUT A REAL TURNING POINT FOR ME JONI AND SAYING TO GOD I'VE HEARD WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE DAUGHTER? BECAUSE WHEN I LOOK AT LINDSAY THE ONLY THE ENEMY. HE WAS STEALING KILLING, DESTROYING FROM GOD. AND THE THING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE, YOU SEEK UNTIL YOU GET HIS WORD AND WHAT WOULD AND CLEAR, AND OFTEN HE WILL SPEAK. AND ONCE YOU WORD FROM GOD IS IN FACT WHEN I HEARD THAT WORD, THIS PLACE UNTIL MY DAUGHTER LOOKS LIKE THAT WORD. JONI: IT WASN'T OVERNIGHT. DOUG: BECAUSE THERE'S A HEARING OF THE HEARING AND THERE'S THE BELIEVING. HIS WORD. THAT WAS OUTSIDE KAREN: AND DR DOUG THAT IS THE KEY, IT IS TO MEDITATE ON IT UNTIL YOU BELIEVE IT. NATURAL IS USUALLY THE POLAR OPPOSITE JONI: LISTEN, I REMEMBER INTERVIEWING PASTOR WELL, WHO HAD A PRAYING MOTHER AND I'M TELLING Y'ALL THE WORST OF THE WORST FOR YEARS AND HE ENDED UP DIE, ACTUALLY DIED. THEY SENT THE AMBULANCE BY COULDN'T SAVE HIM, CALLED HIS MOTHER ON THE PHONE SAID YOU WILL LIVE AND NOT DIE BECAUSE THE LORD AND I'M TELLING YOU HE CAME BACK TO LIFE AND' IS YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. SO, YOU KNOW ONE SO ENCOURAGING FOR PARENTS TO BELIEVE THAT WORD PARENT PROCESS WE'VE DONE SHOWS WITH YOU ON THIS, KAREN YOU AND I KNOW PEOPLE IN MINISTRY WHO HAVE AND THEY ALMOST LIKE BLAME THEMSELVES CHRISTIAN THAT, THAT, THE OTHER, AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND TALKS ABOUT. YES, YOU DO EVERYTHING IN YOUR AND TRUST GOD WITH HIM, BUT AT THE END OF THE KAREN: THEY ABSOLUTELY DO. AND THEIR ALL THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THEY WHEN THEY'VE GOT AN INTERCESSOR GOD DOUG: WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE ENCOURAGE IN THE GET TOGETHER ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND MOMS AND BECAUSE THE POWER OF ONE IS A THOUSAND BUT THAT CHILD WALKS DOWN THE AISLE THERE'LL BE A KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? LIKE WE CAN FACILITATE KAREN: AND THE POWER OF AGREEMENT. DOUG: BUT OFTEN TIMES PARENTS HIDE WHEN THEY HAVE AND THEY START FROM THE FRONT ROW OF THE CHURCH CHURCH AND SOMETIMES THEY WALK OUT OF THE CHURCH WAS GOING ON AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU, JONI: SO, OKAY SO, HOW MANY YEARS ARE AND OF COURSE LOOKS LIKE THEIR MARRIAGE THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE MINISTRY KAREN: HER HUSBAND WAS THE PASTOR OF THE RAMP WAS OVER THE, SHE HAD NO SCRIPTURAL GROUNDS RELATIONSHIP YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAD WALKED SUPERNATURAL WORDS ONE AFTER ANOTHER, AFTER IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS THREE YEARS. A WORD FROM GOD IT WOULD GET WORSE. AND THAT EVEN IF IT GETS WORSE LIKE YOU JUST DOUG: COME ON. JONI: BUT JOY IS COMING. KAREN: AND YOU CAN KNOW TOO THAT IF YOU ARE YEARS AND THERE'S AND IT'S WORSE INSTEAD OF THE WEIGHT THERE IS SOMETHING, BECAUSE GOD IS BUT IF YOU'RE WAITING THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING THE MANIFESTATION OF AN IMMEDIATE MIRACLE. IT JUST MEANS THAT WHEN THE MIRACLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE TRANSFORMED, JONI: YOU KNOW, HOW IMPORTANT WAS IT FOR YOU CONTINUE ON WITH THE CALLING THAT GOD HAD PLACED MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND NOT LET THAT COMPLETELY KAREN: WELL, IT WASN'T OPTIONAL TO GO ON. I MEAN YES OTHER CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN HUGE SO THANKFUL FOR THE SCRIPTURE THAT JUST SAYS RIGHT DR DOUG THERE'S NO PERFECT PARENT, WE ALL PRAYING FOR HER THROUGH THAT. I TOLD LINDSAY TO SAVE A DROWNING DAUGHTER EVEN WHEN YOU'RE OUT LEG BUT YOU'RE DOING ANYTHING YOU CAN TO SAVE BUT IN PRAYER WE DO ALL WE KNOW TO DO. ONE DAY LIKE I HAD DONE IT, I MADE A MESS AND I WENT BIGGEST MESS OF ALL OF THIS, I'VE JUST MADE SUCH KAREN, THIS THING IS SO DONE YOU CAN'T EVEN SPIRIT. IT WAS ALREADY DONE IN THE SPIRIT REALM AS PARENTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PERFECT BY KNOW WHAT? EVEN IF YOU GO TO YOUR GRAVE AND YOU YET YOU JUST GO TO YOUR GRAVE BELIEVING, GO AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN JUST PUT ON YOUR STILL BELIEVE IT.

AND GOD IS CALLING OUT TO THE CHURCH TIME. THERE WAS ANOTHER TIME IN HISTORY WHEN GOD YOU TO HEAR ME. THE BOOK OF ESTHER TELLS US THE ESTHER WAS PUT INTO A PALACE IN A SITUATION THAT HAD DEVISED A PLAN TO DESTROY THE JEWISH PEOPLE, SAME SPIRIT AND WHEN MORDECAI A RELATIVE OF ESTHER THAT MORDECAI PUT ON SACKCLOTH AND ASHES HE IN INTERCESSION, HE SAT DOWN BY THE GATE OUTSIDE WINDOW FROM THE PALACE AND SHE SEES MORDECAI IN SACKCLOTH AND ASHES, THE BIBLE SAYS IN ESTHER 4 SAYS YOU NEED TO CHANGE CLOTHES, AND I LOVE THIS HE SENT THIS WORD BECAUSE SHE SAID SHE SENT HER HE SENDS THIS WORD BACK TO ESTHER OF THE PLOT OF WE NEED YOU TO GO BEFORE THE KING AND PLEAD FOR BACK A WORD TO MORDECAI AND SHE SAYS, "MORDECAI WITHOUT BEING INVITED THAT UNLESS THE SCEPTER IS MORDECAI'S MESSAGE BACK TO ESTHER I BELIEVE IS "ESTHER, DON'T YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT ESCAPE WHEN ALL THE OTHER JEWS ARE KILLED. BUT DELIVERANCE FOR THE JEWS WILL ARISE FROM SOME WILL DIE. BUT WHO KNOWS IF PERHAPS, WHO KNOWS THIS?" OH, WHEN ESTHER HEARD THOSE WORDS, SHE WAS I WILL GO BEFORE THE KING FOR THE SAKE OF MY DIE THEN I DIE AND THEN SHE SENDS BACK THIS WORD SHE SAID YOU GATHER THE PEOPLE TOGETHER GET MY MORDECAI AND YOU PRAY AND YOU FAST FOR THREE DAYS SAME."
