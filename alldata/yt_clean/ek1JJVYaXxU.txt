Hey there! I hope you're ready for some fun, because Aww! These cats have their own compartments for So each cat gets enough! Because you know, Mr. Whiskers...cats If you're new...sometimes I Anyway...division! Division is when we split a Let's say there are four apples. Michael and Liam want to split the apples, and they want to make sure it's fair! There are four apples and we are one for Michael and one for Liam! 4 / 2 This symbol right here is the division sign! It shows us we're dividing! What is 4/2? Yeah! 2! That's right! 4/2=2 If Michael and Liam are splitting Check out this one! Let's say there are six bottles of water That would be 6/6. If we split the six bottles by six, how Uh-huh! One! Great job! 6/6=1 Everyone gets one water bottle! All right! Next, let's practice division Let's say there are nine brand new pencils 9/3 We are dividing the nine pencils so that the students each get When we divide 9 by 3, how get? Yes! Three! Great job! That means 9/3=3 If you split nine into equal groups of 9/3=3 Awesome job! Before we practice more division, What is the answer to a division problem called? What is the answer to a division problem called? The quotient! Yeah! The quotient! That's a cool word! Let's say that together! The quotient! Right! Can we say it one more time, just a little louder? The quotient! Yeah! The quotient! Okay, so we practiced 4/2, which equals 2. 2 is the quotient. We did 6/6, which equals 1. 1 is the quotient for that problem. And we just did 9/3, which equals 3. That means 3 is the quotient for that problem. The quotient is the answer to a division problem. And, don't worry crab! We're going...okay? We have more division to do! Oh my goodness! It's somebody's birthday! Speaking of birthdays, here's a man I'm not sure what he's saying, &quot;I put one candle on my cake!&quot; And she responds, &quot;That's great!&quot; &quot;That's great.&quot; We're going to be dealing with In fact, imagine we have seven candles. Seven of them! Now, in the other division examples, we But in this example, we are because all of the candles 7/1 And the answer is super simple! How many candles does each group have? Well, there's just one group So, the answer is 7! Yes 7/1=7 7 is the quotient! Anytime you divide a number by because all of it is going into just one group! For example, 9/1=9 It's 9, just getting put into one group! 40/1=40 It's 40, getting divided into just one group. 1,000/1=1,000 It's 1,000, divided into just one group! When you divide a number The quotient is that number! Whoa! Look at these two bears! These two bears are going They're going to evenly divide some fish! Okay! Whoa...whoa bears! You both are friends! You both need to share these fish, okay? Evenly! We're going to divide them up! So, there are a total of ten fish, and we One for each bear! 10/2 The quotient, the answer to the division problem, will tell us how many fish each bear gets! What is 10/2? Yeah! 5! Great! 10/2=5 And you can see, each bear 10/2=5 Awesome job! Aww! Hello doggies! Are any of you hungry? I'm asking because...well...I have We have dog biscuits for you to share! We just want to divide them evenly We have twelve dog biscuits here. Twelve of them! And there are four dogs! 12/4 We have to divide or split up the twelve 12/4 will tell us how many dog What is 12/4? Uh-huh! 3! Great job! 12/4=3 Each dog will get three dog biscuits! 12/4=3 3 is the quotient! You are doing an incredible job! Let's try this one, next! How many people do you see here? Uh-huh! 5! There are five people who and are going to take a quick snack break. Thankfully, they brought strawberries! They have twenty strawberries in all and This will be fun! So, there are twenty strawberries in all, One for each person! 20/5 What is 20/5? Yeah! 4! Awesome! 20/5=4 That means each person gets four strawberries! 20/5=4 4 is the quotient! Great! Hey! I think it's time for a division fact! It's division fact time! When you have a division problem, the The number of groups you are splitting And the answer, as we've already Now, a cool thing about division is you and the division problem remains true! For example, 8/4=2 But also, 8/2=4 Interesting! The divisor and the quotient can be switched I'll show you with bananas. Bananas are so tasty! We have eight bananas here. 8/4=2 Dividing the eight bananas into four Two bananas in it! Cool! Now, if we flip the four (which is the divisor) and the two (which is the So, 8/2=4 If we divide the eight bananas into two groups, we see there are four bananas in each group! That's pretty awesome! And speaking of awesome, the next Have you ever played tennis before? Okay! I enjoy tennis! It's a fun sport! Let's say there are a total two tennis players want to split them up. 16/2 16/2 will tell us how many tennis What is 16/2? Yeah! 8! There are eight tennis balls 16/2=8 Okay, so 16/2=8 Now remember, the total we are The dividend is 16. The number of groups you are splitting The divisor in this division problem is 2. And what is the answer to Yeah! The quotient! Great job! The quotient in this problem is the number 8. Now, we learned that we can switch the Let's put that to the test with this! We'll try 16/8 which will be 2. Here are the sixteen tennis balls again. But this time, we'll divide them into In this case, eight players are How many are in each group? Uh-huh! 2! 16/8=2 Fantastic job! So you really can switch the divisor and That's really cool! Okay, let's look at a few final division problems. If you don't know the answer, that's all right! Division can take practice and you'll learn Here's the first one! 9/9 What is 9/9? Yes! 1! 9/9=1 If you have 9 and divide them into nine 9/9=1 1 is the quotient! Great job! Here's the next one! 14/2 What is 14/2? Uh-huh! 7! 14/2=7 If you have fourteen and divide it into 14/2=7 7 is the quotient! Fantastic! All right! Here's the last one! What is 15/3? Hmm... What is 15/3? Awesome! 5! Yeah! 15/3=5 If you have 15 and divide it into three 15/3=5 5 is the quotient. You did such an amazing job! Even if you didn't know all of these, you are well on your way Aww! The cats from earlier! The food was divided up and each cat has enough. The magic of division! Anything to add, Mr. Whiskers? That's okay, Mr. Whiskers! Division means a lot to me, too! Hey! Thanks for hanging out That was super cool! If you had a great time and you can click the subscribe I want to give a big thank you to all of my And thank YOU for watching I'll see you on the next video!
