Reyes: FOR A LOT OF US FOR SO MANY YEARS, THE WHOLE ESSENCE OF BEING IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS BORN THAT WAS BORN IN THE BARRIO. AND TO ME, LOWRIDING -- Gomez: REAL LOWRIDING STARTED HOW LOW CAN YOU GO, YOU KNOW? I EVEN SEEN CARS WHERE THE TIRE AND THE CAR Rodriguez: CAN'T GO AROUND WITH AND SO ON. YOU HAD TO REPRESENT. AND WE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY TO, RAISE THE BAR TO BE THE BEST. Somano: THE VALUE WAS THAT YOU MADE A COMMITMENT. AND BEING ORGANIZED, STEPPING OUT OF WHERE YOU'RE YOU KNOW, WE'RE IN OUR CARS, YOU KNOW? AND WE'RE HAVING FUN AND WE'RE GOING TO PARTIES AND WE'RE PART OF THE COMMUNITY, BEING ROLE MODELS Reyes: IF I HADN'T DONE IT, AND I MEAN THAT VERY SINCERELY, THAT THE TYPE OF LIFESTYLE THE WHOLE PROTECTIVENESS OF THE SO FOR ME, IT WAS NOT LOSING BUT AN ALTERNATIVE. SO, TO CATCH THE HISTORY AND TO LEAVE SOMETHING TO LEARN HOW WE DID IT, I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. Constancio: LOWRIDER IS AND SAYING, THIS IS ME. <i> ?Y QUE?&quot;</i> Male Announcer: &quot;SAN DIEGO ROMANTIC? YES, INDEED. ESPECIALLY Ornelas: THAT CAME TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY THEY TENDED TO BE CONSERVATIVE. THEY TENDED TO BE WHITE, AND THEY BUILT THE CITY ACCORDING TO Male Announcer: ALONG A SMOOTH, WIDE STRETCH Ornelas: BUT THE MEXICAN DATES ALL THE WAY IN THE 20th CENTURY, THE COMMUNITY GOT CONCENTRATED AND THAT HAS A LOT TO DO FAMILIARITY AND ALSO THE FLUIDITY FOR MOST OF THE 20th CENTURY. SO, THE CHICANO COMMUNITY GREW AND STRENGTHENED Torres: I GREW UP IN AND THIS WAS MY HOME, HERE. IT WAS A TWO-STORY HOUSE, AND THE WHOLE AREA HERE THERE WERE DOCTORS, LAWYERS. ALSO DRUG STORES, AND WE EVEN HAD A PARADE HERE. AND THEN, THAT'S WHEN THEY CAME &quot;YOU HAVE TO MOVE BECAUSE WE'RE AND WE MOVED. THEN THEY STARTED THE CREATIVE MIND AND THE IMAGINATION AND WE STARTED LOOKING AT THIS AS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT NOW THIS IS A NATIONAL Man: GIVE YOURSELVES GIVE IT UP FOR Woman: Man: <i> iSE VIVA!</i> WOMAN: Man: <i> iSE VIVA!</i> WE'RE JUST GETTING WARMED UP. Aguilar: TODAY, WE ARE OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PARK. AND THERE'S A LOT AND MOSTLY AND FRIENDLY PEOPLE, IT'S A BIG FAMILY-DAY EVENT. TODAY, I BROUGHT IT NEEDS WORK. IT'S NOT FINISHED YET BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS I USED TO CRUISE AROUND HERE BEFORE THE BEGINNING Constancio: CHICANO PARK WAS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE RAZA OF LOGAN HEIGHTS WERE GETTING TOGETHER &quot;YOU'VE BEEN &quot;YOU'VE DIVIDED THE COMMUNITY. YOU BUILT FREEWAYS THROUGH HERE, AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS, IN FACT, WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO IS BUILD Rodriguez: THAT THEY KNOCKED DOWN AND BUILT THE CORONADO BRIDGE, AND SOME OF THE HOUSES NOW THEY'RE GONNA PUT WE THOUGHT, &quot;THAT AIN'T RIGHT.&quot; SO, AND WENT DOWN AND PROTESTED, &quot;HEY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PARK.&quot; Constancio: PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER HERE AT CHICANO PARK. AND, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T HAVE AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IT WAS JUST WORD OF MOUTH, BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY, AND STOPPED THE BULLDOZERS AND CHICANO PARK, YOU KNOW, IT WAS A SYMBOL IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE THAT THAT THIS WAS OUR HOME, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE THAT WE Gonzalez: THE LOWRIDER COMMUNITY A VERY IMPORTANT PART IT CAN BE TRACED ALL THE WAY TO THE TAKEOVER OF CHICANO PARK. THE CHICANO MOVEMENT WAS RESPONSIBLE AND FIGHTING FOR OUR RIGHTS THE CAR CLUBS -- THEY BROUGHT IT THEY SHOWED THEM AND ORGANIZING OURSELVES. IN THE YEAR 1970, IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO LIES A LITTLE PIECE OF LAND. A LITTLE PIECE OF LAND OF LOGAN HEIGHTS Reyes: CHICANO PARK, NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE WERE BUT WHAT IT MEANS [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] AND FOR US THAT GREW UP THE LATE '60S, EARLY '70S, THE PEAK THIS LOWRIDER CULTURE WENT HAND IN HAND MAKING A STAND AND THIS YEAR, WE WERE HONORED AND COMMEMORATE ON BEHALF Constancio: IF IT WASN'T HERE IN SAN DIEGO, WE WOULDN'T WE UNDERSTAND VERY CLEARLY THAT LOWRIDING HAS PLAYED AND THE LOWRIDERS OF HAVING CHICANO PARK SOMEWHERE NOT JUST BUT TO SHOW THEIR PRIDE. AND I THINK THAT'S SHOWING THAT PRIDE. [ BELL DINGING ] [ MAN SINGING IN SPANISH ] Torres: MY FIRST TIME THAT I SAW I COULD SEE HOW LOW IT WAS AND RIGHT AWAY, LIKE THAT, IT REMINDED ME OF OUR PERIOD, I COULD SEE THAT SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN THE FELLAS THAT HAD CARS AND SOME CARS HAD SKIRTS, AND MANY OF THE CARS A LOT OF THE SEAT COVERS IN TIJUANA, MEXICO. AND WE REALLY LOVED MEXICO, BUT WE WERE PUT DOWN BECAUSE A LOT OF US WE WERE MADE FUN OF. SO, WE WERE NOT REALLY ACCEPTED AND WE WERE ALSO NOT ACCEPTED SO WE HAD OUR OWN WAY WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED AND SO, LOS GALLOS, WE WERE ALWAYS ATTENDING DANCES AND BEACH PARTIES AND PICNICS, AT THE DRIVE-IN THESE ARE THE JACKETS IT HAS THE SOMBRERO, AND BEFORE THIS WAS A PARK, THERE WAS NO GRASS, AND WE WOULD DRIVE OUR CARS AND WE'D PARK ALL AROUND HERE. AND WE WOULD BRING OUR GUITARS, A LOT OF THE TIMES ALL THE GUYS BY OURSELVES, AND WHENEVER WE WOULD SIT IN THE CAR AND AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, [ LAUGHS ] ENJOY OURSELVES, YEAH, BUT NOBODY WAS HERE, AND WE WERE ENGAGED IMPROVING OURSELVES, ESPECIALLY. OUR CLUB GAVE US A LOT AND WE HELPED ORGANIZE AND THAT INCLUDED AND ALSO, AND WE DID IT TO CEASE FIGHTS THAT WERE GOING ON AND WE ALSO CURTAILED LIKE, IF WE WERE GONNA HAVE WE'D GO TO THE SOUTHEAST IS THERE ANYBODY WELL, THERE WAS OR THERE WASN'T, SO THE SOUTHEAST YOUTH COUNCIL BUT EVEN AFTER WE WERE ORGANIZED AND WENT TO SACRAMENTO THE <i> UNION TRIBUNE </i> REPORTED &quot;JACKET CLUB REPORTS YOU KNOW, WE HAD A PRESIDENT, A TREASURER, A SERGEANT OF ARMS, THAT'S WHO WE WERE. AND SO, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN THEY STILL LUMPED US IN Lopez: I WAS PROBABLY WHEN I GOT INVOLVED WITH THAT WAS INFLUENCED BY Hollman: THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ORGANIZING. I MEAN, WE WERE ABLE WE ORGANIZED DANCES, Lopez: NOW, THE NAME BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME, 1950s, EARLY '50s, NOBODY WELL, A FRIEND OF MINE, THEY WERE AT A MEETING ONE TIME, WHAT THEY WERE GONNA CALL AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CLUBS -- JACKET CLUBS, THEY WERE NAMING THEMSELVES AND ALBERT SAYS, WE'RE CHICANOS.&quot; WOW. BECAUSE NOBODY AND SO, MY POINT IS, LOS CHICANOS HELPED US DEVELOP THAT WE WERE SOMEBODY. A LOT OF US WENT TO COLLEGE. I'M PROUD TO SAY Reyes: WERE AN IMPORTANT INFLUENCE Arturo: I WANT TO WELCOME I KNOW THIS IS SHORT NOTICE FOR THIS SPECIAL MEETING. ALL RIGHT. OPEN IT UP. LET'S SEE WHERE WE ARE, ARTURO, AMIGOS. Reyes: I STRONGLY FEEL THAT, EVOLVED INTO CAR CLUBS. Gloria: Reyes: THE JACKET CLUBS George: Reyes: ORGANIZING EVENTS Arturo: YOU GUYS ALL KNOW Man: GERMAINE'S GOT Germaine: WE TALKED ABOUT IT THAT YOU GUYS WOULD HAVE Reyes: AND ALSO, WE USE A VERY SIMILAR STRUCTURE THAT SOME Man #2: JUST A REMINDER DUES ARE DUE NEXT MONTH. Reyes: ANOTHER BIG INFLUENCE THE GREAT MAJORITY WEAR THE SAME STYLE SO THERE'S Martinez: MY BUSINESS RE-STYLING THEM. WE DIDN'T CALL THEM LOWRIDERS, CARS, TO ME, YOU KNOW, YOU CHISELED ON IT, CHANGE IT. WHEN I LOOK AT A CAR, &quot;LOOKS LIKE A MILLION CARS SO I'M GONNA DO IT DIFFERENT.&quot; Torres: AND HIS AUTO SHOP HE WAS VERY IMPORTANT FIGURE AND HE EXPERIMENTED A LOT. Martinez: CUSTOMERS -- THEY WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW I REMEMBER THIS GUY AND HE GAVE ME 1,000 BUCKS DOWN, AND EVERY TIME HE COME IN, SO I'D CHANGE IT IN THE FRONT, PUT IN CADILLAC HEADLIGHTS LIKE A SHADE OVER THEM. THAT HOOD HAD A CHROME, LIKE AND I MADE THE SCOOP DISAPPEAR TO THE POINT TOOK ALL THE BUMPER BOLTS PUT MERCURY TAILLIGHTS ON IT, AND I PUT HIS INITIALS SMACKED IT ALL OUT. AND THEN I PUT BUICK CHROME I PUT ELECTRIC DOORS, SO WHEN YOU PUSHED THEY WOULD TOUCH EACH OTHER AND PAINTED IT TWICE -- ONCE WITH BLUE AND SILVER, &quot;I WANT THIS CAR TO BE&quot; -- HE SAID, SO I PAINTED IT ORANGE AND THAT'S WHAT I DID I DID A LOT OF WORK INTO IT, MY SCHOOL WAS IN MY YARD, MY DAD USED TO BE A MECHANIC. I WAS ABOUT 16, THEY WERE WRECKED SO MY DAD USED TO SCRAP THEM. THEN LATER ON, I LEARNED TO WELD I STARTED TO PAINT CARS NOW. THAT'S WHEN I MET GUYS WOULD GET TOGETHER, JOAQUIN, ONE OF THE MAIN GUYS, Durant: WE WERE AND IT WAS ALL WE ALL HELPED AND WORKED BUT IT WAS ALL HIS IDEAS. WHEN HE BUILT A CAR, THE FRAMEWORK, THE TRANSMISSIONS, EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY Angelo: THIS MAN THERE WAS NOTHING AND LET ME TELL YOU, Loux: AND SO HE BECAME MY HERO, SO, THE BEAN BANDITS, TO ME, OR THE GUYS TO BE AROUND. Angelo: AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE &quot;YEAH, THE BEAN BANDITS YOU GOT TO GO UP TO THE RACES 'CAUSE WE USED TO PUT ON QUITE WE WEAR MEXICAN HATS AND WHITE SHIRTS THAT ALONE -- THEY WOULD PAY US Martinez: PART OF THE FAME AND LOT OF THE SPEED CAME FROM AND RUNNING ALCOHOL BUT JOAQUIN PLUS THE IDEA OF BUILDING THEM, THE LENGTH AND THE GEAR RATIO, Durant: JOAQUIN AND HE WAS DOING ALL THAT TYPE HE WAS A BODY MAN. HE COULD DO ANYTHING TO A CAR. Angelo: THERE'S A GENTLEMAN DID A LOT OF THAT. I WENT TO BOBBY AND I SAID, &quot;BOBBY, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, HE SAID, &quot;WELL, I SAID, &quot;I DON'T WANT NOBODY BUT HE SAID, &quot;NO, NO, AND IT WAS PERFECT. AND IT CAME OUT BEAUTIFUL. ONE JOB AND HE WAS A LITTLE LOADED, AND SOMEHOW, AND ALL HIS SHIRT HE SAID, &quot;OH, MY GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID? HE GOT EVERYTHING GOT HIMSELF CLEAN, AND THEN HE STARTED MAKING FIGURES AND HE SAID, AND THE GUY THAT OWNED THE CAR AND HE SAID, &quot;MAN, AND THAT'S SO THIS GUY'S GOT Martinez: DID COLORED CHROME, I WAS PAINTING THIS CHEVY, THAT HELPED ME FORGOT TO SO I'M SPRAYING AWAY, IT WAS A TRANSPARENT PAINT, IT'LL COVER IT UP AN IRIDESCENT BLUE. SO I WAS PAINTING THIS CAR, AND I HIT IT WITH THE FIRST COAT IT WENT LIKE COLORED CHROME. I SAID, &quot;MAN, IT LOOKED LIKE GOLD, BUT IT WAS BLUE. SO I SAID, &quot;REMEMBER THAT.&quot; ONE IDEA MAKES ANOTHER IDEA, IT JUST COMES TO ME. YOU PICK UP SOMETHING AND IMPROVISE. Gomez: I WAS JUST A LITTLE BOY AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE OLDER GUYS IN CHOW TOWN, AND THEY ALL HAD CARS AND I WAS ALWAYS INTERESTED. I WOULD WATCH THEM WORK ON THEM, AND I WOULD JUST ALL AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THEY WOULD BE LOWERING THEM AND PAINTING THE BOTTOMS. AND IN THE '60s, AND IT WAS ALL THE GUYS THAT IT WAS A SOCIAL CLUB. AND THEN ALL THE GUYS HAD CARS. I HAD A '55 NOMAD. IT HAD AIR SHOCKS ON THE BACK, SO I HAD IT REALLY LOW AND I WOULD GO PLACES AND AND THE CAR WOULD GO DOWN, THE BUMPER WOULD BE INCHES WHEN WE GOT OLDER, SO THEN WE STARTED IT WAS A HANDFUL OF GUYS. WE USED TO HAVE OUR MEETINGS, WE HAD IT PRETTY WELL-ORGANIZED, AND I HAD A LOT OF PRIDE I'D REALLY DO ANYTHING ONCE WE STARTED EVERYBODY WANTED AND SO THE CLUBS STARTED Rodriguez: BROWN IMAGE AND IT WAS BASICALLY SOME OF US YOUNGER GUYS FROM THE BARRIO STATION. BARRIO STATION TRYING TO KEEP US Casares: THE ZAPATISTAS, I MEAN, THEY DIDN'T HAVE I MEAN, THEY WERE JUST FIGHTING AND WE ENCOURAGED THEM AND AS THEY WERE DEVELOPING THEIR CHICANO PRIDE BECAME A VERY IMPORTANT PART Rodriguez: BROWN IMAGE BACK THEN, IT WAS IT WAS LIKE, YOU PUT ON AND YOU WERE SHOWING YOURSELF YOU CAME IN WITH A NICE LOWRIDER AND YOU SHOWED STYLE, YOU'RE CRUISING. Gomez: THERE WAS ANOTHER CLUB IT WAS CALLED CHICANO BROTHERS, AND SOMEHOW, NATIONAL CITY YOU COULD PAINT YOUR CAR, THEY HAD ALL THE TOOLS. AND THEN ON WEEKENDS, THEY WOULD HAVE PARTIES Aguilar: THE FIRST LOWRIDER CLUB WAS CHICANO BROTHERS DON'T FORGET, YOU GOT OFF THE BASE FOR THE BATTERY. I WAS BORN IN TIJUANA, MEXICO, GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, MY BROTHERS USED TO DO A LOT OF BODYWORK AND THAT KIND OF STUFF, AND THE CHICANO BROTHERS, THE WAY WE GOT OUR WAREHOUSE, I THINK IT WAS CHUCO, ARTURO RUIZ, OR SOMEBODY WE HELPED HIM THROUGH ONE AND HE SAID, &quot;WE GOT THIS THAT THE CITY HAD MOVED &quot;IF YOU GUYS WE STARTED USING THAT AND A PLACE TO WORK ON THE CARS. ON WEEKENDS, THAT WAS ALWAYS FOR PARTIES, MUSIC. EVERYBODY KNEW I THINK THAT WAS THE CONNECTION FROM SOME OF THE CLUBS Rodriguez: SOME OF THE GUYS OSCAR RIVAS HAD USING HIS OWN CONCEPT, WHERE THEY ACTUALLY AND CHOPPED IT IN HALF THE CUSTOM PAINT JOB. HE HAD AN UPHOLSTERY GUY ACTUALLY CUSTOMIZE Cota: LOT OF WORK BECAUSE IT WAS CHEAPER AND THE CASINOS, THE BROWN THEY USED TO GO TO... ...AND WE USED TO MAKE FOR ALL THE CAR CLUBS. AND I USED TO WORK SO I USED TO DO THE MENS' WORK. YOU KNOW... AND STUFF LIKE THAT, MY HUSBAND AT THE TIME, WE USED TO GO LAS PLAYAS WE USED TO CRUISE AROUND. <i>PERO, </i> AT CERTAIN POINTS... [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ HORN HONKS ] [ HORN HONKS ] Reyes: IT'S A SMALL NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN I WAS 16, 17 YEARS OLD, THAT WAS THE MOST PROTECTING MY NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT ONCE I STARTED TO REALIZE THAT THERE WAS MORE TO LIFE I DECIDED TO FOCUS MORE ON MY FAMILY, AND I GOT MORE INVOLVED AND SOME OF MY OLDER FRIENDS AND THAT REALLY ATTRACTED ME. I END UP JOINING THE CASINOS I WAS GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL THE CASINOS HAD A REPUTATION AND MY TRIP WAS BEING OVER THERE WAS SO FOR THAT REASON, I MADE IT A POINT BUT YET, MANY OF THE CLUBS STILL SAW US SO IN 1977, AND WE STARTED THE AMIGOS. AND WE'VE BEEN HERE EVER SINCE. THIS IS A 1929 WILLYS KNIGHT. I'VE HAD IT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. I DECIDED TO FIX THIS CAR YOU DON'T SEE TOO MANY I HAVE QUITE A BIG INVESTMENT AND MOST OF THE CAR IT REFLECTS MY EXPERIENCE AND I SAID BUT WHEN WE'RE TRYING GRASPING THE REALITY WE CAN'T DENY THE FACT THIS CAR IS DEDICATED ALL THE WOMEN THAT FOUGHT AND CONTINUE TO FIGHT TODAY. AND TO ME, THAT BROUGHT IS HERE, A DEDICATION TO MY MOM BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT UP FOUR KIDS SO THE WHOLE DEDICATION OF THIS [ SINGING IN SPANISH ] WHEN I STARTED LOWRIDING IT WAS SOMETHING INNOVATIVE, WE CALLED IT MEXICAN Martinez: I SAW YOU KNOW, THIS IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW, BUT IT WORKS. ON THE SETUPS ALL MY FRIENDS GOT TOGETHER, YOU GOT YOUR CYLINDERS YOU GOT TWO DUMPS SO YOU CAN YOU GOT THE BATTERIES HOOKED UP HOOKING UP TO SOME SOLENOIDS, WHERE THE SWITCH WHERE YOU CAN HIT THE BACK OR AND IT'S AN OLD-SCHOOL CAR.

BACK THEN, IT WAS THE STREET. Somano: THE CULTURE IT WAS A PART THE CHICANO SCENE, THROUGH THE COMMITTEE WE USED TO GO DOWN A LOT OF THE EVENTS WE WENT TO, AND WE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, I WANT TO HAVE MY OWN CAR.&quot; WE DREAMED OF IT. Cano: BACK THEN AT THAT TIME, A LOT OF FEMALES WEREN'T ALLOWED AND IT SEEMED LIKE LOWRIDING BECAUSE IN THE WORKPLACE, THEY DIDN'T WANT WOMEN SO I GOT TIRED OF IT. I SAID, LADIES PRIDE WAS THE FIRST THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAD AND I SAID, THAT WHEN SOMEBODY THEY KNOW NOT JUST SOME GIRL AND THEN, ALSO, THE GIRLS TOOK SO WE JUST AND WE CAME UP Castillo: BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, AND WE HAD OUR CARS. AND THAT BECAME OUR PRIDE WHICH ACTUALLY WAS THE LOGO THAT I HAD ON THE BACK IT STARTED OUT BLACK CAR, AND THEN, EVENTUALLY, IT WAS, THEN I HAD A T-TOP PUT ON, THAT WAS REAL POPULAR Cano: WHAT WAS REALLY DIFFERENT WAS THAT WHEN YOU SEEN EVERYBODY WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE WHO'S GONNA COME AND THE EXPRESSION WHEN THEY SEEN IT WAS A WOMAN... Castillo: IN FACT, A LOT OF US, WHEN WE WERE PARKED OR WE WERE AT AN EVENT SOME OF THE MALES THAT DID NOT AND THEY WOULD SAY, &quot;HEY, OR &quot;IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND'S CAR?&quot; AND WE WOULD GET A LAUGH WE WERE SO PROUD OF OUR CARS.
