- [Arlo] Antarctica is a continent where basically no food grows. (calm instrumental music) - Penguins regurgitate seafood to feed their young. And we caught a bird of a newborn seal. (bird caws) - [Arlo] You could say options So, what are we, now supposed to eat? - From the moment we landed-- What's this? Arlo and I were basically Stop eating nuts. We're about to order a pizza. (muffled speaking) - [Caitlin] If you're 20 minutes before dinnertime I'm at least gonna shame you about it. Ew! For good reason. - That's the fuel, yeah. - [Caitlin] Tom Senty at McMurdo Station. - The amount of calories working out in the deep field can be 32 to almost 5,000 calories everyday. - [Arlo] For context, the to consume between 1,600 (shovel whooshes) down here, just by nature, but the extreme cold also itself causes you to burn - And we're not just making this up. Loads of scientific research supports it. (bells ding) So we craved food, especially carbs, all the time. There's like three more - [Arlo] And it's not just us. - My second year, I and my diet meant no thirds. - No what? - No thirds. (people laugh) - So. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Arlo] The station is home so the kitchen staff is a lot of very hungry mouths. - [Caitlin] And a huge amount to keep the station running. Wow, this is big. Everything in here is like supersized. - Yes. And that takes a lot of planning. - So we're creeping on almost to make sure I don't run out if you will. - [Caitlin] A massive food for the following year. All the food then gets that arrives in January, and that food needs to feed the population That's unfathomable. You're planning for a million - Right. - [Arlo] So, how do they do it? What is the secret sauce? (muffled speaking) - Our first clue can be found here, (peaceful instrumental music) in the historically preserved So is everything that we're - Yes, it's exactly as-- - So like that pot. - That pot, yeah. - Scott used that pot. - Yeah, Scott used that pot. - And this table. Oh sorry, I probably wasn't (Michael laughs) We'll cut that part out. - [Arlo] Scott's team was one of the earliest to explore the continent. - Okay, I told you I'd cook - [Arlo] And some of their provisions are literally still on the shelf. Hold it. All right, no wait, come back. Where you going? All right, I just wanna a thing at this time. - Pickling, canning, kept these foods shelf-stable and they're still here today. Anchovy paste, gooseberry, pickles, those are a big thing here. - [Caitlin] They're kinda I wonder if this stuff is still edible, like can you eat a hundred years ago? - [Arlo] You could try. (laughs) - Somebody in the galley mentioned to me that expiration dates - [Michael] That's true. - [Arlo] That might sound but it's no joke. Expiration dates are actually - I've had like a sandwich in my backpack that I've had for a month and to eat that thing. - [Arlo] We were told that (engine roars) - What's your expiration date? - It's rubbed off. I think it's 10 June 2015. And that's just something - [Zac] How's it taste? - Like cardboard with a And it's not just bars. Would you like a bite? - [Zac] You're really selling it. (Caitlin laughs) (upbeat instrumental music) a lot of the food that's - Expired food is something the entire time you're here. - Yeah, I noticed. (laughs) - It's inevitable. Lots of categories like that cheese will get down We haven't even gotten it here Just because it takes longer So we freeze the cheese. - The second secret to Antarctic cuisine, freeze it. This is a massive amount of meat. - And you can feel it's - This is just one. There's a tub full of them. Fortunately, there is no and this is part of why We all know that food rots if left out at room temperature. (liquid splashes) the biological activity - [Arlo] So what Caitlin freezing food makes food last longer. (bell dings) - [Caitlin] The challenge down here is actually thawing the food. - We'll have to turn on that heater because that much frozen food will bring down the to so low that it won't thaw. - You actually have to in Antarctica. - Yes, exactly. - Wow. In the McMurdo galley, lots and meat arrive frozen and - [Man] Oh man-- - [Caitlin] Frozen veggies. The third secret of Antarctic - [Arlo] Yep, you heard - Well, I mean we are in we can't just run down to and pick up more product. - [Caitlin] So you're taking the leftovers and you're just gonna repurpose them and put them right back out there. - [Justin] Just repurpose, bringing it back up to temperature, throw a little cheese on it, makes it look like it's hot and people eat it up. - Add cheese, just add Sometimes the food is delicious. Oh, this is what I helped when we saw them cooking in the back. - [Arlo] Sometimes, it frozen then thawed then recycled food. Ah, I think I'm good. (laughs) - I'm definitely getting some bread. Hey, guys. - [Man] Hi. - I was okay with the vegetables and then after about three you're like, it's really - There was a line for spinach. - Raw spinach. (laughs) Like, there is never a except in here in Antarctica. - [Man] It's been a while since we've had just green beans though. It was just green beans for - [Caitlin] After a while, - [Man] You just lower your standards. Get used to it. - You make do and the with what they have. - [Caitlin] But there are some ways that the McMurdo kitchen truly shines. - [Man] When there's I have a better day. - Taco Tuesdays. - [Caitlin] What is it - [Man] They're so good. - [Hooded Man] What is it - [Caitlin] See, now I get excited. - [Arlo] Aside from the chicken tenders, it's a carb factory. - [Caitlin] Vats of They have a bakery with four bakers. Fresh desserts and artisan - And perhaps the biggest crowd pleaser-- McMurdo Pizza, this is Pizza. They bake about 18,000 pizzas a year. So how long you been doing this? - So this is my fourth season coming down. - Well pizza, McMurdo pizza, because we have pizza fresh right there, right as you walk by it. So often, people walk by and they realize there's fresh, hot pizza sitting right there so they and slide it right onto with all of the food. - [Caitlin] And it's - It's amazing, yeah. - [Caitlin] Not frozen and rethawed. - Oh no. - [Caitlin] Not expired. - We don't have room in our (Caitlin laughs) - It was so good that I of pizza on this trip. Hey, is this the line to order a pizza? So we'll do pineapple on half, Do you have whole wheat pizza dough? And it's not the kind of I'm more of a fruits and (plane whooshes) In summer, when the big C-17 they can bring fresh food, or (muffled speaking) Stuff like veggies, eggs, and fruit. And it is coveted. We haven't had any fresh food in-- - Stop, you're a pig. And we haven't had any fresh food for, what was it, a week? - [Arlo] 10 days. - 10 days. - [Arlo] Did we wash these? - Time for a quick tour of camp. While McMurdo is equipped Welcome to the Whillans Ice Stream. (upbeat instrumental music) A lot of scientists are living far from the station. And for them, the food Hello Marino. - [Marino] You're not recording, right. - [Arlo] I am recording, in fact. - [Caitlin] Before they - So down this aisle we - [Caitlin] They pass through McMurdo and pick up everything they'll need. Oh peanut butter, that's important. - Peanut butter and jam. - [Bija] So a lot of the condiments. - Peanut butter and jelly, when I'm out there. - Yeah, so we have basically of all of the different types to make a pretty good So there's cereal, there's - [Caitlin] And because they and living out in the cold-- - Dehydrated. - [Caitlin] They get access to this shelf. - I love the Bumper Bars, too. I don't know if you all - So I've been saying that I feel like a kid in a candy shop, now I'm like actually a - (laughs) It's all the bars. It's all the bars, it's What do you think? this product but it's very good. (laughter) - [Arlo] They are also provided and depending on the size of the camp, they might get a small I feel spoiled now. - Yeah, we're super spoiled out here. - [Arlo] Often, scientists So what are another examples In the past, we've made a Lots of pasta, pretty much - Hold on, hold on, you - No, not on the grill. No, yeah, we have some nice to boil up a bunch of water. Yeah, it's a pretty nice setup. - And they can eat pretty well. Man, this whole time I thought you guys were suffering out here. - [Shane] Oh yeah, I wouldn't No, it's pretty nice. - [Man] Shane, you are the man. Thank you. - [Tom] Food is the morale. - [Server] Here you go. (laughs) - You know, morale equals They go hand in hand and Down here, it goes a long way. - [Arlo] Food down here (muffled speaking) More than ever, food makes people happy. - It is fun to make some fresh muffins and see a smile on someone's face who was just staying up all - [Caitlin] And it brings people together. How long do they need? Both in the field-- - My parents actually have so I'm very used to this - I'll do seven days of - There we go, deal. (men laugh) - [Man] I'm in. - [Arlo] And in McMurdo. - [Caitlin] And the way to make friends, (woman laughs) especially when heading - Oh, I can't believe it. of the little-- - [Caitlin] Is to bring - (laughs) Ooh hoo hoo. - [Caitlin] While not much that actually wasn't always the case. Antarctica used to be green and filled with massive dinosaurs that feasted on lush vegetation. Wanna know more?
