Miss, how do you feel about winning the award? With today's result, I believe that my father's soul in the heaven will be happy for me. I will definitely not let him down. I want to build my own red wine kindom in China. Do you have anything to say to the Chinese people? I have only a word. Shan Li, I'm back. So she came back to compete with you. Just an award of Best sommelier, she wants to be the queen of China's wine industry, so young and naive. Ms. Shan, The trademark infringement case has new progress. Our lawyers have strong evidence to prove that their defense attorney made fake evidence. If we appeal, we will definitely win. What are you waiting for then? Appeal immediately. But that lawyer Mr.Zhang is very cunning, he asked a new lawyer in his law firm to do these things. I'm afraid it will be difficult to defeat him this time. These are all the fake evidences they made. Mr. Shan, if nothing more, I'm leaving now. I'll find a lawyer to discuss the appeal right now. Wait a minute, is this the said lawyer? Yes, his name is Zhao Xi, he's worked at Zhang's law firm for just one year. He's been used by Zhang since the first court session. If we sue him now, he will never be a lawyer again in his life. Ms. Shen. How about it? These sommeliers agree to sign the contract with us. Now they are waiting for you in the office now. What about that auction? The auction will end in half an hour. Are we going to the auction now or the office to sign the contract now? Go to the audition. Ladies and gentlemen, Wine is mentioned 521 times in the Bible.

Listen, it doesn't taste good. Here. Have this. This? Yes. I want to eat that. So picky. Take it. What are you doing? It's hard for me to explain to you because you are stupid. You can't understand it either, can you? They are tasting the wine blindly. They can know the variety, year and origin of the wine by a sip. Because their brains have remembered hundreds of tastes of red wine. Blind tasting? Yes. Really? They are that good? But actually it's not that difficult to remember the taste. Not that difficult? Yeah. Okay, not that difficult, you try it by youself. Hey girl come here. Okay. I can definitely do that. It feels like the smell of freshly cut wheat. What? Keep going come on. It also smells like the noodle made by my mother. Oh and licorice. A little spicy. Are you guessing? But you are right. Come on, choose another one and guess. Come on, hurry up. This fermentation of this is not as good as that one. What? Wow, you are great. Because I run a bakery in my hometown. Do you know that whether the bread is fermented well or not depends on my nose. Okay, whatever. Anyway, from now on, I don't own you anyting. From now on, I will continue my rich life, and you will continue your poor life. We have nothing to do with each other, okay?
