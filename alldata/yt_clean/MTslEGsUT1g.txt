Can You Beat "Far Future" with Personally, I'm not sure...I'm obviously lying- but if you know anything about this coming up that might be very useful Also, I'm sorry that this video I decided to get a new mic to sound better for Let me know if this is even working...sorry But enough talk about flying I don't know how to describe the future- THE FUTURE! Weird, I thought ...what happened to your face HEY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LAWN? it's so GLOWY well dave, these green sticker tiles, to chain across multiple plants as long as put plant food on a peashooter um...okay what was the point of that- woah! better try that one again! ...yea I still don't get how this is helping- AWESOME! you can plant anything? Welcome back SPRAY PEAS! After that awfully long tutorial, we headed into day 1, with these peashooters which inspired me to continue planting them and combine peashooter with but in the midst of building up my team, thankfully he's as strong as a wet flannel- but can be a challenge to take with his super-mega jetpack he's but he also has the ability to blast i guess he's vegan...or something- we beat the level and unlocked spring laser bean as we all know...AS WE ALL KNOW- is not a garden warfare plant, and is in fact but you can play as him using mods!!! I swear to god, my brother said this to day 2, and oh would you look at it's like we're assembling the as mentioned earlier, power tiles let you on the same colour tile, why am i Well with my massive brain I thought that cactus and using a plant food and obviously that didn't work...because but in the midst of me struggling this gumball dispenser on a treadmill, of him which blocked all of my...oh but that doesn't mean he'll this guy has like a MILLION health-...interesting- after wiping out these other 2 zombie fish tanks- we moved on to...Day 3 spider imp- ...simp- i didn't know what these small...bugs- would do to my plants, so to play it safe i deployed kernel did i drag you out of your i think i must've bought this costume some point but im just gonna keep so after planting down my cornfield, we destroyed every zombie in sight you know how sometimes suns are bombs?- ...this is one of those times- so these radioactive purple suns, decide to somehow hitting the ground, the evil sun turns if you haven't already noticed, I and that's not because I'm stupid...its not- the rate of sun in these levels which means that sunflower isn't of use anymore... go home- we managed to get by the level with brain in a spaceship...what am i even playing- day 5, that is NOT a conehead zombie- i'm not gonna sit here and go through every far future so we got by with only these two plants actually managed it's not even like the power tiles but with zombies spawning rather fast early plant to use whilst torchwood can you can pick your friends, but why not? you...ugly food truck- thankfully we were given sunflower but that didn't matter as after CITRON FINALLY we get someone new to citron whilst costing 350 SUN, also you kinda suck man- but as a matter of fact, citron is a the more tanky zombies such as the cone...drone and by activating his plant food ability, citron fires an electric ball citrons powerup is basically a weaker you kinda suck man- but thanks to citron we beat day 7 and received, hello gardener, in this year your well how's that possible if i'm talking Hey, wait, who are you? wait stop AHHHH- ahh welcome back conveyer levels, i really i don't know what it is about snapdragon showing up on every world's conveyer but despite having citron and snapdragon, this level was VERY stingy with giving me the especially with the amount take out in the literal first seconds So failure after failure, resulted in me cheat code!...where I decided look guys DON'T GET MAD AT ME, these levels aren't even part of the challenge but I'm still not to name names in the PVZ youtuber my fellow PVZ youtubers who make these just skip these levels ENTIRELY that I'm putting in the work for you so after equipping Cactus' walnut ability we had way more time to hold off these early and this didn't necessarily make the level easier as after the first few plants someone thought it would be funny to throw just to stop me from getting even with walnut added to the team, as there was a deliberate cap on how many and if you don't believe me, 5 citron, but eventually we made it to the final day 9, never have more than 15 plants you see? I never needed e.m....piss off- day 10, what the fu- How is this "iron lung"-looking it looks like they're driving but interestingly this imp duo summons waves exactly the same way the disco and despite their size, their still able to be eliminated with so we moved on to PEASHOOTER LEVEL and this time, i meant it...this was really easy- the same thing went for day 12, day day 14, don't spend more than 1500 sun... well i guess this strat wont work anymore- but noticing that there were 3 squares efficient with being able to power up and after using our good old these constipated oranges- day 15 protect these endangered citrons, even but with the help of snapdragon, we're able to do and whilst I was proud of my clever strategy day 16, yet another conveyer level and what a great selection of plants- whilst we are not capped this time to how the plant rng isn't AWFUL and would much so the hardest part of the level is actually just planting a citron in every lane before with some lucky rng and correctly choosing which lawnmowers to sacrifice we're able to buy just enough time to plant a we gather over time, the rest of the level looks like we don't have much but were you not freaking out over how magnifying grass can pack quite the PUNCH- this level forced me to use the plants day 18 WHAT...WH-6000 BLIMMIN SUN, ARE YOU HIGH? if you think i'm overreacting here, look at this attempt where i made it to the as long as you plant a sunflower every 7 seconds, thats if these all-star pushing faces day 19 had me once again using sun bombs, and i got by this level so quick i day 20...why are you here... fruit shoot- just like the last endangered if you disregard the orb shooting citrons but after the plant-pushing football face...twat, knocked back my starfruit and got we got given a lawnmower trophy..(i'm this powerup actually lets which made me think back to when we so revisiting the "zombie xp farm i fired off our lawn mowers and...oh..i can only shoot off one...i'll be day 21, make 5000 sun, overplanting will get i'm starting to get really actually that's a lie, i got sick with my sunflower ring working together, somehow- i guess there was but we're back with another peashooter level and with being given four plant foods, i don't have to explain this every Oh look! we killed day 23, bruh to conserve the amount of sun i can use, i to plant snapdragons, with 600 sun left as well as know why i didn't use sunflowers...no that's day 24...sun bombs again- I once again used my cactus strat however i somehow kept blowing up my plants, which popcap? more like: blow up. your. house- but with taking down day 24, I don't know, i got nothing- we finally arrived at day 25... boss fight time (robot voice), you get it? i did a robot voice because isn't it convenient that your neighbour is i mean, nah that kinda makes sense with one secret word my sleeper listen to me David... hamburger this zomboss fight is actually seemingly different with citron being part of the garden warfare team, there's a slight chance we and this definitely wasn't gonna be easy, when just like last time, the biggest enough citrons to take out the sheer and when i wasn't looking for citrons, the game forced me into a tic-tac-toe majority of the time, i was simply being given and even managing to place a whole row of citrons, zomboss felt the need to run into the few or should i say square 13 because however after MANY close calls, as well as we somehow ACTUALLY took out zomboss with only but that'll have to be for next time as there warfare plants, and WAIT...don't leave please, you already watched oh and don't forget to like the VIDEO-
