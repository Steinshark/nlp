MATTHEW: Last one of you to leave this basketball TOMMY: All right, let's go. MATTHEW: Oh oh wait wait wait wait I'm going to throw this medal away, so if you want to get it, you Wait--what is he doing? MATTHEW: Today we're doing basketball challenges where one person will be eliminated each round, and the last one standing wins. First challenge is the behind-the-backboard shot. Guys, we can't leave the court. We already lost a ball. This area here counts as the court. You can step onto this grass. [cheering] Editor, don't show the first one. MAGGIE: How did that happen? TOMMY: There we go. Bang! MATTHEW: Only two more people will be safe. MATTHEW: Oh no, Colin. MATTHEW: Not again, not again! First one to make this is safe. [cheering] Owen has one chance to tie. MATTHEW: Since you lost the first challenge, you have one three-pointer to save yourself otherwise he's going to be lifted off the court. Here we go. Bye Owen! We love you! MATTHEW: Is he trying to take Tommy with him? MATTHEW: Keep your foot on the court. Keep your foot on the court. Next challenge is backwards. Last one to make it might be eliminated. MATTHEW: Isabel, let's go. MAGGIE: You lost two of them! Isabel gets to go again. That was a joke. But we have our personal rebounder to get the balls that go off the court. [cheering] No we lost it over. MATTHEW: Meanwhile Tommy was coming Oh! Wait, what happened? How did you get a medal? Woah, woah, woah. Who gave you that? MATTHEW: This is only for the winners. MATTHEW: If you win, I think that would be poetic. I'm just visualizing my victory We're all going at the same time. For this shot, I get the middle. TOMMY: I'm right here. MATTHEW: I don't know how we're going to tell which ball. TOMMY: What if they all go in? MAGGIE: Wait, yeah? Someone made it! I think it was Isabel. It was the blue ball. Who threw the blue ball? ISABEL: Me! Us three. The three oldest are in danger. Isabel, you're safe now. It's just the three oldest. Colin has to go to the bathroom? You have to leave the court if you want to go to the bathroom, TOMMY: Oh darn it. MAGGIE: Are you kidding me? [music] [cheering] You have one backwards three pointer, and you'll have one normal three pointer. The gold medal is just slipping away. TOMMY: Darn it1 TOMMY: I can still stay in though. MATTHEW: All right, Tommy, one three. If you miss, you get carried off the court. Everyone watching this, it's times like these when champions are made. MAGGIE: That was deep. [cheering] I'm not losing. I'm staying right here. So we just did two trick shots, but now we're going to go to the easiest shot of basketball--a lay up. First one to miss is eliminated [music] MAGGIE: This is actually scary. You can't miss if you never shoot. MATTHEW: We all have to make one more. COLIN: Guys, guys, guys. I'm going to win it by doing something cool. MATTHEW: Colin, if you miss, you're out with Maggie. Guys, that means that Maggie and Colin are going to be going head-to-head. We're going Maggie v. Colin. First one to miss is eliminated. TOMMY: Oh no, Maggie. Maggie. MATTHEW: If you miss a three-pointer, you're out. TOMMY: Maggie MAGGIE: I'm not a basketball player. I never so I leave with nothing lost. Bye Maggie. Bye guys. Colin has been asking me for so long to do a 1 v 1 challenge, and we're doing it right now. We're going to have two games of 1-on-1 and the loser of each will fight for elimination. We're going to randomly pick who plays against who. Tommy and Colin MATTHEW: I'll let you start. We're playing to seven. You kind of needed that one to MATTHEW: I can't get the ball. Hey wait. What's Tommy doing? TOMMY: I'm selling concessions Yes four to zero. ISABEL: I forfeit. MATTHEW: Nope, nope, nope. TOMMY: This right here is where champions are made. TOMMY: All right Izzy, let's bring it. Let's go Isabel is going to play the TOMMY: May the best player win. [music] MATTHEW: Oh, you tried. MATTHEW: Bang! Three to two. Colin's got the lead. Oh, with the left! Oh boy, he misses! MATTHEW: Oh he misses. All the way! All the way! MATTHEW: 4-2. Colin's got the lead. Tie game. MATTHEW: Launches it! MATTHEW: Tommy needs just two more to win. TOMMY: Good game. Oh! MATTHEW: Chat, is this rizz? [laughter] MATTHEW: For the win . . . Bang! MATTHEW: Colin versus Isabel. MATTHEW: Last time they played each other, Isabel beat Colin. MATTHEW: Let's see if he can flip the tables. Whoever loses will be eliminated. ISABEL: He's almost as tall as me now. MATTHEW: All right, here we go. TOMMY: Colin wins the tipoff! And he takes it straight to the rack. TOMMY: Isabel is not messing around here. She's not messing around. TOMMY: Oh, Colin taking it left. With a three . . . TOMMY: Woah, what a save! MATTHEW: She almost left the court! MATTHEW: Through the legs! 3-0. TOMMY: There is no such thing as defense. Oh! It's a three! [music] MATTHEW: All right, Isabel. If you make this you stay alive. MATTHEW: Isabel is eliminated and TOMMY: I took my shoe laces off and tied it to a golf club. TOMMY: Yes! MATTHEW: No! TOMMY: I got it! MATTHEW: Sorry, Tommy. Maybe you'll get this if you win fair and square. MATTHEW: It's starting to rain, so we've got to get going. TOMMY: It's a lot more difficult now without my shoelaces. MATTHEW: This shot you're actually not on the grass last one to make it could MATTHEW: If i make this, like and subscribe. Like and subscribe. You have to. You actually have to. I made it. TOMMY: Good job, Matt. MATTHEW: Thank you. Colin's a very good competitor, so I better score this soon or else he will. COLIN: These are the moments where legends are made. TOMMY: That's sounds familiar. Oh! MATTHEW: Tommy, the gold medal is in danger. He has one chance to tie, and then one three pointer. This is the moment where champions are made. TOMMY: That is crazy. MATTHEW: One three pointer. If you miss, you're eliminated. MATTHEW: Oh! He doesn't get the gold medal. TOMMY: I got bronze? MATTHEW: Do you know what time it is? It's time to carry Tommy off the court. TOMMY: Good luck. You're actually going to carry me? Go Matthew, go! Don't drop me! I found myself a bronze medal and I'm The rain is starting [birds chirping loudly] The rain is really starting to come Whoever wins this, wins the gold medal.
