Hey, it's me, Destin. Years ago, my buddy, Brady Haran, on the internet, or one of them, altitudes on his way up I love it. Okay, the water is boiled now, and the [soft piano music] I love it. But today we're in Tanzania, to go all the way up to the top I asked Brady if I could replicate And he learned a few things along the way And we're going to try And a long time ago, Nasa did an experiment where they put us the oxygen from the tank. We simulated an altitude of 25,000 feet And it had to do with And it's a fascinating thing that happens So today on Smarter Every Day, we're going And along the hike, we're going to see how and we're going to talk about that. But I think the water is Shedrack. Shedrack, right? You're very right. He's the man. [S] Yeah, we're still now boiling. So how many different places We are going to boil the water So this is our starting point. This is our beginning point. [D] What's our altitude here? This altitude is 8,170 feet. [D] 8,170 feet? Where we are going is 9,127. Tonight, where we are going to sleep. [D] How high is the highest we're going to go? The highest we can go, to boil the water like this, But we will try to boil [D] Which is 19,000. You ready? You're in Celsius. Oh, okay. Yeah, I'll turn on the Celsius. Celsius. 92... 92.7 on one. You're 92.7, [S] Okay. [D] Now you're a guide. [S] Yeah, I miss. I miss to be a porter, about what I'm carrying right now. Was it fun being a porter? [S] Very fun, and actually, And for me, I think it's good. For those who want to become guides, So it will be like... It's a very good consideration for someone So at least you [D] So you can relate to the team? [music continues in background] Boom. This is First Camp, 9,200 feet, and now we have 91.8. [D] Yeah. Mine's 91.6, [S] Yeah, the same. Okay, no joke. Earthquake, right? [T] Yes. [D] We're in the rainforest right now. You can see all the vegetation, [S] We are crossing the natural We are now entering [D] The heather zone is characterized by what? [S] The heather zone, actually this name is which dominated this area. I mean, those heather trees like That's why we call this area. [D] Are those Latin names that you're saying? [D] Okay. [light upbeat guitar music begins to play] [D] Asante. Coming up on 10,000 feet. 89.7 Very curious to see what As you can see, we started with 92.6. Yesterday was 91.4, and now we have 90.0. As we're going higher, it seems like the [D] All right, I think this is Kilimanjaro. Two days in, you finally get to see it. Altimeter says 11,500. [S] Which is very correct. [S] Very, very correct. [D] 89.4. [S] Yeah, let us go with 89.4. [D] Okay. Today, we're in what's But this feels like Utah or maybe, So we're in the third [S] The correct number is 87.8. [D] 87.8, I got 87.3. [the porters begin clapping and singing an upbeat happy song] Mine's 86.9 [S] 87.4. [D] So this was 13.7? [the porters singing louder] [a call and response part of the song] Jeffrey. Let's go. [D] Let's go. I wasn't fast enough with the camera, but Olaes is up there carrying my pack, the big pack. He was past me before I could Insane. [S] We are the Pofu camp. Actually, now we lose like 500 feet down, and we If you tap this side of the mountain, to the Crater Camp, and then up [D] So we can't see Uhuru peak. [S] You can't see Uhuru peak from here. [D] Okay, but that's where we're going. [D] So where are we at right now? [S] We are on the north side. [S] Yeah. [D] Okay, the next zone that you walk This flower is everywhere. [guitar and percussion music begins to play in the background] [S] The elevation here is 13,000 feet, and we [D] Okay. It's a little bit different, yours was.. [D] and mine is at 87.5 Okay. I'm going to go also measure It could be that. [S] It's different even [D] We were 100 foot higher. Here we're lower... Here were lower and it went lower. It could be salt content If there's mineral content in the water. [S] The different in the water source. [D] I wonder if that- [D] That could matter. [D] Because if this comes from a different minerals in the water. And this actually coming from the ground. [D] Okay. That could be it. Every morning, they have to check our brain is getting enough oxygen. I got to 90. Currently 13,100 and ascending to We're seeing how our bodies handle to be a big indicator for summit day. We're moving up into thinner air Epeta, what's our elevation? [E] We are 15. Okay, we're at 15, What are we doing? [Loma] Right now, we are going to 16, Then come back to the camp. You don't need to go further more than 16 energy for tomorrow. [D] Even if everybody's feeling okay, Don't go higher. [D] Okay. Keep energy for tomorrow morning because [D] Yes, sir. Loma knows what's up. We're learning everything It's the trickiest day. You can see all the guides are lined up telling us what to expect. 85.7. You have 85.6? [S] Yeah. [D] You think we'll get to the 70s? [S] Yeah. [S] Yeah. We have to test our oxygen. Whoa. 79.... Is that normal? [someone yelling from background] Turn the camera off! [D] Turn the camera off! that's it. Hold on. [Saji, the Guide] Try again. [Woman in background] Is your hand cold? [Destin takes a deep breathe] [Deep breaths] Eighty-six (02%), 94 (Heart rate), Saji! [S] Yes, 96. 91, 91. Write that one! [D] It's like walking in loose [the mics begin to pickup the loud wind] Go ahead. 18,300. Climbing some rocks. You kind have to take a step there's not a lot of oxygen up here. I wonder what the partial we're at 18,355, There's Master, I would like to introduce This right here takes all of your oxygen. Then you have to stand Then there's another one. All right, man. Yeah, that's good. That's good. Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah. The mustache. Oh, mustache. Very good. That looks good. [S] Push to the top, it's getting hard now. Just now crossing 19,000 feet. Head's throbbing. Heart rate's pretty high. Just got to keep moving. [background music begins to build] Final push it's last 80 feet. [S] Good job. Good job [D] Thank you, buddy. You made it happen that's the sign. Thank you, Okay, we're at the peak, altitude 19,341. I see the gas cylinder. Canini is building a shield. Think we can do it? [S] Oh, yes sir. [D] I can't believe this is happening. We're about to boil water [S] Mine is 81.2. [D] Mine's 81.0. [S] Yeah, we did it. [S] We did it. [the sound of wind rushing] Okay, before I show you the descent down thing, and there's special rescue I want to talk a little bit about things here because it's fascinating. I've got some bullet points here. The first thing I want to say is There's a handful of people that die every and there's a large percentage So this isn't just something you do. This is a once in a lifetime And this is just a really big deal. And so you don't want to do We worked out a lot. I tried to limit the amount of oxygen stress my cardiovascular system. We also went to altitude to try to see how to over 14,000 feet. Altitude sickness affects And so you need to know what And so we tried to prepare Another note I have here is that happened to us that was incredible. We looked up and we could feel our hearts rushing a man down the mountain. They were clearly saving him. It was a rescue situation. He had an oxygen mask on, like, Oh, my goodness, We are not playing around. At that moment, the porters, who were They were calming us down. Inside, we were all freaking out. Wondering if that was But they were managing our mental state focus on the next few steps. It was amazing. I would love to point you to a podcast explains more of that. Another thing about how we did 13,000 feet for several days. We took what's called That's one of the most If we had not been with Killy Warriors I'm not so sure I would have They always say, Pole, Pole, pole. Pole, Pole. Pole, Pole. They would limit you with how fast you your cardiovascular capabilities. In fact, on the acclimatization hike, on that one day to 16,000 feet, and I was going too fast. And my heart rate ran away, for me to get that back down. So the guides really They go far slower than you think you exactly what they're doing. I was leaving for approximately, Probably. My pace was too fast And then Loma said, No, right? Loma said, Pole, pole. It takes discipline that I don't have. Thermometer calibration. Do you remember when Shedrack said, Oh, to the '70s, and at the top we didn't? Well, calibration is an issue. I boiled water here in Alabama, and I got above 100 degrees celsius. So Shedrack might have been right. The water might actually A really cool thing happened Nasa astronaut, Matthew Dominic, was in the cupola before we summited and he took It is awesome knowing that that little the clouds, we're on that mountain. There's a couple of pieces of internet consider checking out. The first one is that podcast It's a podcast I do It's called No Dumb Questions. And there's a particular We talk about the porters and all the It's really interesting, The other one is the videos The first video was the whole idea here. Brady, when I asked permission to make the idea of boiling water at altitude. And I was like, Well, you do to me. Because 10 years ago, I watched a video And I've been thinking about it forever. It was an intelligent, mixed together, and it's what It was gorgeous. And to follow it up, at Nottingham University explained including some things that Brady Now, videos like this don't just happen, The sensationalism reigns, applied to creators all the time. And I understand that you want to get more can get more money for advertising. And that's not good for the Internet, I want intelligent, respectful content Brady figured out how to do that. He partnered with academia to make those and it's very difficult to figure out. This video is not sponsored It's supported by something new. There's something called and they've given an award And the only thing they've asked thoughtful about the next piece And I think that's really cool because Something's going to be And the question is, should you watch it? That's what they're trying to do. When I was younger, I would watch PBS. I would watch Mr. Rogers's Neighborhood, money and private donations. But TV is not a monolithic So what IMI is trying to do is they're and foundations and even private donors respectful content for the Internet. So what ends up happening is IMI ends up making thoughtful content. So if you want to check out what they're which I'll leave a link down in the video trying to do, because they're trying They're kicking against the algorithmic on the Internet, with more thoughtful content, Thank you, IMI, for supporting this video. Thank you for considering I'm excited about what they're doing. They're a nonprofit, thoughtful content for the future, So now it's time to go down the mountain. All right, we're leaving. [upbeat plucky guitar music begins] Thank you, Shedrake. [D] You're an impressive man. [D] And your team is the best. We are very happy because all [D] It's because of Killy warrior. [S] It's because of Killy Warrior. [D] You have a good outfit. [S] We have a very good team behind us. [D] People like Boaz. Are you relieved? [D] I appreciate your leadership. Highest altitude you can be Here's the stretcher. 15,000 feet. It's pretty far up there. She bumped me on purpose? So these are little carts that are Of course, you got a stretcher here. But I was expecting to see this all But they're pretty cool. They have shocks on them. That's pretty neat. It's incredible. So I'm not filming as much on the way why he's not being paparazzi. It's because everybody gets hurt and I don't want to get hurt. What do you feel? [T] I feel very happy that we summited, are now back at the camp for the day. However... 12 hours hours of exertion, and I have no clue how I'm [D] It's not like a little exertion. It's like all you can do, like limited [T] No, because also it's Your knees on the way down? Yeah. That was a pretty epic journey. It's a great thing to have done. Yes.
