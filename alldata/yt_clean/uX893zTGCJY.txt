This CPU can do everything and it may just unlock with an AMD XQ chip. It's fast. It's powerful TDP of 65 Watts, which means this is possible. are we going to tell you all about it. We're not going to believe and it all happens right desktop CPUs are finally here and we are incredibly low temperature. We just gave you a sneak peak of the ASUS Zenbook S16, which we're pretty with our first look. And now we get a look at the both the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X in the video on the 9700X. Don't worry we'll sprinkle day in the sun even if it's currently hissing to know the 9700X a bit more starting with the of $359.99, which is actually $40 less than the This is a great direction to see prices go and As the successor to the 7700X the 9700X is an 8 Ryzen 9000 product stack. While the 9700X does higher boost frequency and a significantly the name of the Ryzen 9000 Series game, but for has worse performance than a Middle School all. We're talking about wider dispatch execution Branch prediction, accuracy, more predictions and unified schedule, and more a has also improve performance in gaming, content creation, Is it all marketing hype? Did we just spout a Well let's find out. So right out of the gate we've noticed that the 9700X is keeping AMD's and well. When we looked at the average wattage of under full CPU and while gaming. On the other hand 14 gen CPUs keep in mind that all the Zen 5 cores cores here. So this does make sense. Underload the its predecessor the 7700X averaged 131. The new 87.49 Watts. When we look across the aisle over at Even the core i5 14600K had a CPU watt average similar story for the 9700X. A CPU watt average of It's freaky weird, but we double checked the data had an ever so slightly lower power draw at 84.98. averaged 121 and the core i7 14700K average 166. may be looking at this and thinking Robey, 88 watts 65 wat TDP? Is AMD lying to us about power? Not so thermal design power is the metric AMD uses to but it's not the same as Max socket power or and AMD's master software we saw that the actual benchmarks. Just a quick aside here while we're the 7700X and the 9700X in PPT is 54 watt, which the performance data. When it comes to thermals the all things considered. We saw idle temperatures 54deg. And gaming temperatures actually slightly 14700K was 30deg C at idle, 83deg C underload, and idle, 80deg C underload, and 59deg C while gaming. load, and 71deg C while gaming. That is bonkers. 55deg are great but, how does this all translate into absolute monster. In cyberpunk 2077 we saw an average In Forza Horizon 5 we had 337 frames per second and and Shadow the Tomb Raider 301 frames per frames per second. Keep in mind these numbers were frame rate to drive CPU usage. And this doesn't when we look across the charts the 9700X just nice during the Olympics this would have gotten of the flagship 14900K was not even close. So I the higher you go up in resolution the less your or 4K the 9700X is still going to be an incredible to be pushing way more of those frames and you will see which we're intentionally pushing But this is actually only one side of the Zen 5 to test multi-core and multi- thread operations got beyond two cores and four hardware threads the of steadily increasing the more we got along. It's AMD is the new single thread leader and Intel is new news the 7700X also trail behind multi-core across our test results we found that the 9700X over the 7700X. But not by as much as we hoped for, of these tests were done at 88 Watts as compared With the thermal overhead we're seeing in the precision boost overdrive or just overclocking in play and actually push it beyond then and it feels make this even more weird. We saw a far bigger performance over the 7600X. All we can figure of power as the 9700X, but it has fewer cores. So Now you might be asking. Robey where's the X3D data time with these chips and unfortunately, we only going to test these against the 7800X3D, but from does actually outperform the X3D in certain game we'll have more videos on that in the future. Now talk more about comparisons with the 7800X3D in 9700xX Well for right now we don't actually have that we have a lot more questions than right now processors with also rumored X3D processors for Ryzen 9's. They're going to tell us what we need to you need a CPU for high compute scenarios you may actually do. Also, this could change after release. and we're testing these on pre-release biases. So we could see as it matures. And that's guys I'm what I hate about reviews on brand new released time. And anybody who says that this is the is full of poop, but right now going back if you're now. If you're using your system for gaming and crushing tasks in the 1 to 2 core kind of range and And with that second part in mind it's only makes PB&amp;J of Robeytech. It's time to talk a PC build, together a parts list for a beautiful gaming PC might even be able to get it even cheaper if you people who live near a Micro Center, which sadly we going to look extra amazing inside of the Phanteks we have a full parts list down in the description the screen, but here are a few highlights as the have the ASRock B650 Phantom gaming Riptide and PNY's Verto OC Nvidia RTX 4070 Super. And if you Deep dive on what makes them so special right performance? A machine that is anything but mid and that claim up. This time we cranked everything Cyberpunk 2077 at an average of over 139 frames second. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 average when we tune settings down for competitive play. 287 frames per second and finally in Tiny Tina Those are some absolutely incredible numbers platform to 2027 and beyond. A machine like this Now before we close this whole video out there's that this CPU absolutely excites us with. With can impact your performance. We have a CPU that but thrive in a small form factor build like the We actually tested the 9700X with the Bequiet for compact Mini ITX builds. While we saw an ever the temp temperature averaged 85deg C under full from TJ Maxx. And that means that there's some room to link a few SFF builds below that also hover system this is more of a guide than a blueprint. us that you can get solid gaming performance at a our initial thoughts on the Ryzen 7 9700X. There's wait to see what AMD has in store as this platform for giving us the opportunity to check this CPU Make sure you stick around for our Impressions on meantime we want to hear from you. What do you are there possibilities a CPU opens up that you in the comments below. Now while you're down there like button and ring the notification Bell so we post a video like this right here on Robeytech. what might be the best Ryzen 9000 series build or server discord.gg/robeytech.
