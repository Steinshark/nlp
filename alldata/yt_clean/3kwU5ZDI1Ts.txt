We were trying to save us all. So they kept saying all these years. Now we were many that believed that How to stop this thing. They never did. Now, why do you think that is? Before you answer... let me give you my perspective on things. You see, I read up on our history. You know, the time before everyone died. All I saw was terror. Infinite terror. Violence. Death. People would gather in the for any dumb reason. Did you know we have bombs Apparently, there are thousands So I can't imagine any other explanation than that. We released this shit into the air ourselves. What else would it be? Oh, we don't know that. I mean, it couldn't have been. That wouldn't make any sense What is it that you don't understand?

I saw what they did to you I couldn't attack them So I waited and all of a sudden, You caught me by surprise. Hey, I have questions. Who are you? Why do you look like me? You look exactly like me. How is that possible? After all this time and you don't know? All right. There's a place up ahead. We can rest there and you can have your questions. [suspenseful music] Why don't you start by Cora. What's yours? And what's your number? My number? 4A16. Then that's your name. I'm 95B71. I just call myself B7 and you're A1. What do you mean? Tell me. We're clones, you and I. Part of the Cora project. Nobody knew what they were. Okay, listen. No, no, no. I'm Cora. I would know if I was a clone. [suspenseful music] Do you remember a big celebration? A convoy of trucks. A lot of people just before Yeah. What about it? It was all such a big deal, being The truth is, we were manufactured. You woke up one morning believing Genetically engineered with imprints of memories to Where you grew up at HQ as an believing you were part of a grand plan. A strong attachment to this cause. We all have the exact same memories. I don't believe you. That's impossible. So who am I? I don't know. I could simply gone home if I wanted to. They would have been - Right? - But you never did. Did you ever think about go back to Homebase once Why there were so many and rules we had to follow all the time? Tim. I met Tim the other day. He was dead. But there's clearly more to this, right? You met our male Hundreds of Coras. I found encrypted files for Removed at some point and replaced with us. I mean, think about it. Thousands of disposable agents like us sent out alone to do the There's so few people left now I don't blame them for that. They had good intentions. It's just that it didn't Tim. He had killed himself. I didn't know what he meant so... that's why I left to find out. That's fucked. [soft dramatic music] I mean, how couldn't you know any of this? They abandoned the project years ago. I didn't get a fucking notice. I kept on doing the same thing every day. I got my drone deliveries, so any of it. Really? You know, in my sector... we were assigned to go into the big cities and collect things for them. We were tools made to be thrown away. They made sure too we They attacked us, placed bombs inside of our delivery boxes. I got lucky. The bomb never went off in mine. That's when I realized I was fucked. So what happened? Why did they leave? They obviously failed. The question is, where did they go? They didn't attack us here. Maybe they ran out of explosives or time. I don't know. Look, I've been wandering around I stacked up on as many I searched my sector for a very long time. And now here I am. I mean, when I first saw It was a long time ago I mean, look, the past is gone. It's over. I hate them. But I want And what is that? Haven't you been fucking listening? They used us. They lied to us, and Come with me. I mean... help me find them. Help me find them so I have a place where Come on. We can't stay here so. [soft dramatic music] Close the door. This ain't no base. But I've tried making places This will keep us warm. Come on. Sit. If you hate them, why do you still have the suit? It's got a lot of tech inside. I wouldn't throw that away. If it's one thing they were It's really sad. All of it. Tell me about the cities? Well. You already know that most I believe most people died The concentration of mist is You're basically walking Can't see shit. I never saw much of just empty spaces everywhere. [heavy breathing] I dreamed that I would [wind howling] I guess that day will never come. At HQ I found this map. It was lying next to a lot of I believe this is the key to finding that. What will happen if you find them? If they're not willing to give us a spot we'll take it by force. You seem awfully sure about this. What choice do we have? Survive in small bunkers. I've done that. It doesn't work. Eventually they run out of power Look, I need a fucking exit here. I've been on the run for four years. I need to find a real home. Time to switch filters. Sometimes... I just want it to be over. It's like I can't breathe. I keep having these dreams about Scenes from videos of the old world. Clear Sky. Families. Normal people. That kind of knowledge can kill a person. You know, that blind hope. - But I think we need hope. - Oh, yeah? What good did that ever do? No. Surviving is what it has come down to. The sooner you realize that What? Ending it how we want, You should get some sleep. It's a big day tomorrow. You'll need the rest. [dramatic music] What do you see? Let's stop over there for a second. I've searched most of these spots. There's your headquarter. They couldn't have gone that way. I've come up with nothing so far. But on the other side of this It looks very promising. And behind that, there's a blank spot. It could be a valley, a settlement. Might be nothing, might Wherever they went, it They wouldn't just abandon What makes you think Well, you would need to be Of course, there's the ocean, but just There's too much white. Getting here will take a Yeah, sure, but this Hopefully we'll find a boat that works. I'm with you but... how sure are you of this? It seems you've been everywhere. Nothing's for certain, right? You have to ask yourself. Are they alive? [wind howling] Yes, absolutely. Then these are the only spots left. When the time comes, can I Yes. See. I told you. [suspenseful music] [ship motor running] Okay. Now what? Okay, here we go. Take point. I'll provide cover if needed. What do we look for? I don't know. People. Hatches, anything. [suspenseful music] Hey, A1. Come on, keep it tight. B7, there's nothing here. Probably a decoy. Keep looking. Hello. My name is Adan. You're in my home. If I wanted you dead.

If you point it towards the Can you see me? Yes? This is a mine. We are hundreds of feet below ground. We can breathe down here and What's he saying? Now a question. What are two remnants doing in my home? We're looking for our old group the scientists. Ah. Yes, yes. Interesting. An interesting bunch. Very unorthodox, definitely. But also very out of touch with with the likes of me. I'm the legacy of the world gone. You two are just a failed experiment to keep their wheels turning. Okay. I survived because I'm smart.
