And Tyler is filming Brady And no one was actually filming me when I said that last line, lovely. I know it's hard to tell but it was extremely late at this point. And this was literally the coldest I've ever been in my entire life. I was miserable. Remember that question Well, the answer is this video cost me around $300,000 to make. For the price it took I could have bought a real house. I really hope you enjoy my suffering, it was expensive. - [Karl] I hope it's gonna fall forward, I hope it's gonna fall towards us. Oh, maybe just one, maybe one. - I see you have sledgehammers? - [Chris] Yeah. (group groaning in disgust) - It smells like pee. - It does smell like pee in here.
