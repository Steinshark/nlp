A police car that was nearby but the chaos of the situation in the police dispatcher the suspect as an African American male. (laughter) - [Voiceover] Classic!

The police car driven Eric Zelms would come upon sidewalk described by officer 170 pounds, about 40 years reddish hair and a crew cut. Very similar to the description However, because they were male, Fouke and Zelms left the man alone. Watching him disappear Brutal right? Right now we're coming up allegedly saw the Zodiac. They turned left onto Jackson right here. And they saw a white So the officers think he entered through here, and The Zodiac would later a later letter in detail. Making it very likely that contact with that nation's at the time without even knowing it. A composite sketch would descriptions that would wanted poster. - [Voiceover] Is this the - [Voiceover] Yeah, it is. - [Voiceover] It is the one Ted Cruz. - [Voiceover] Regardless, the Ted Cruz wasn't even alive people. Case closed, it wasn't Ted time traveler. - [Voiceover] Unless he changed Remember how obsessed about they were? I want to see Ted Cruz's is all I'm saying. - [Voiceover] Another crucial bloody finger print discovered in the cab. However, the Zodiac also planted by him to throw Two days later the San letter that claims responsibility Paul Stine's murder, and blood stained shirt. Even more horrifying, the &quot;School children make nice targets, &quot;I think I shall wipe out &quot;Just shoot out the front tire &quot;as they come bouncing out.&quot; End quote. He also later included be used on buses. - [Voiceover] Where is he How does he get these - [Voiceover] I don't know. Also, like the image of the little desk getting his, like, pen ready-- - [Voiceover] I mean he calligraphy. - [Voiceover] Maybe. - [Voiceover] This guy got a fucking quill pen. - [Voiceover] He has - [Voiceover] What's the desks? - [Voiceover] Oh fuck, I don't-- - [Voiceover] There's a specific name. - [Voiceover] After this, created so that multiple On April 20, 1970 a letter to included a cipher with the Which would later become potential suspects. The Zodiac would continue stopping in 1971. Only to send his last letter have killed 37 people and of The Exorcist, which he called, quote, the best satirical comedy that - [Voiceover] What? This guy. - [Voiceover] I can't imagine a Rotten Tomatoes review - [Voiceover] Because he had no friends, the only people he could the police. - [Voiceover] Do you think he today if he were still alive? - [Voiceover] Oh, he'd Yelper. - [Voiceover] Skipping forward, police department was able profile from a Zodiac letter The profile was not enough a single person, but enough suspects. And with that, let's take the most circumstantial The first theory is from Gary his father, Earl Van Best Gary Steward published a book Animal of All that presents this theory. Earl Van Best Jr bares to the composite sketch His name also matches the my name is cipher. Finally, Stewart says a certain that Best's handwriting matches the writing of the Zodiac killer. Now, here are reasons why According to an administrator marriage certificate came of the priest and not Best that was virtually certain rather than Best. - [Voiceover] Where do you like, certification skills? Probably from the fucking - [Voiceover] Oh shit! What did the University - [Voiceover] They're - [Voiceover] Are they? Furthermore, Best only Zodiac at the Paul Stine large-faced description of three killings. Gary Steward also tried to the recovered 2002 Zodiac complied with their reason to make a case. Gary Stewart has maintained - [Voiceover] Number, why did evidence to comply? - [Voiceover] Yeah, why not though? - [Voiceover] Yeah, does what's the reason not-- - [Voiceover] Maybe that DNA they just had no time The second and most famous who believes that Arthur Leigh This theory is the basis for starring Jake Gyllenhaal - [Voiceover] Who is that? Internet sleuth? Like us? - [Voiceover] He's definitely - [Voiceover] Okay. He has a card. (laughter) - [Voiceover] Actually, Robert cartoonist at the San obsessed with finding the Zodiac. After a decade of personal books entitled Zodiac and implicate Arthur Leigh Here's Graysmith's case The day of the third Zodiac in 1969, Allen told his family at Lake Berryessa. Later that evening, he would with a bloody knife in his car. And if you'll recall, the that day with a knife. Two years later in 1971 Don Cheney said that Allen before the killer publicly as the Zodiac. - [Voiceover] Wait, wait, wait, wait. So, he literally called - [Voiceover] I guess, that's true. - [Voiceover] Hey Ryan, call that's my nickname. - [Voiceover] How do you even - [Voiceover] I know, right? - [Voiceover] The only time bowling and you write your Write your name as the Zodiac. - [Voiceover] Right. - [Voiceover] And then &quot;Who the fuck wrote their Could you imagine if he's like Like, he won't respond They're like, &quot;Arthur you wanna go out?&quot; He'd be like, &quot;That's not my name.&quot; (heavy sigh) - [Voiceover] Ugh! - [Voiceover] &quot;Okay, Zodiac Okay. Cheney also said Allen told people with a gun and a - [Voiceover] What? You tell your friend that. - [Voiceover] I know. - [Voiceover] He just &quot;You're such a funny guy.&quot; - [Voiceover] You're such a trickster! As a result of this information, Allen a second time where book is The Most Dangerous Game. A book about a man who hunted humans. And a book referenced by the to the press. To add insult to injury, Allen brand watch which the killer used. The police searched Allen's small dissected animals in and sexual devices, but no - [Voiceover] That's a weird Cut up animals and sexual devices? - [Voiceover] Oh no, the freezer, that would be weird. No one wants a frosty In 1974 Allen was convicted a crime for which he Coincidentally, during were received. In 1987 a San Jose jail told police that Allen admitted Paul Stine. In August 1991, Vallejo interviews Mike Mageau, second Zodiac attack and mask on. When shown a lineup of man who shot him, it - [Voiceover] What? - [Voiceover] With this info, home again and this time constructed bombs, and tapes They interview Allen again - [Voiceover] Wait, wait, plans for bombs in his they're not able to detain him? - [Voiceover] The Zodiac fucking letters. - [Voiceover] Right, and he children's school bus and - [Voiceover] And there was killer, this guy's reliving via audio book? What the fuck? - [Voiceover] He just a at this point? - [Voiceover] One year Allen is found at home dead And with that, let's transition not be the Zodiac killer. Allen's DNA was compared from stamp saliva on a Zodiac letter, it was not a match. However, it's also believed letting others lick his which would explain why the - [Voiceover] But I don't guy was smart enough to think that. - [Voiceover] In my opinion, stretch. Additionally, in 1971 finger prints, but the prints prints recovered from the They also had Allen undergo but the handwriting did not Allen also does not look Paul Stine killing in the mentioning that Arthur the prime suspect for the police departments and the Zodiac. The third theory is from police officer, Harvey Hines more commonly known by Zodiac killer. Kane was involved in a car in brain damage influencing his behavior. One psychologist claimed Kane was quote, &quot;Losing the ability to end quote. Additionally, Kane can &quot;my name is&quot; cipher. And in that cipher there circles around them, and Kane was born in 1924. - [Voiceover] Okay, that - [Voiceover] Yeah, I didn't - [Voiceover] Well, I mean, straws at that point. - [Voiceover] Additionally, Darlene Ferrin had a sister who followed and harassed up to Darlene's murder. In the 1969 Paul Stine murder, the Zodiac seen by officer as 35 to 45 years old. Kane was 45 in 1969. Officer Don Fouke said in pictures over the past 20 Kane was quote, &quot;The closest &quot;the killer.&quot; End quote. Kane also lived a six minutes Geary, the location where cab to have picked up his killer. In fact, an excerpt from &quot;Investigation has placed &quot;several of the Zodiac's &quot;killed,&quot; end quote. To piggy back on that South Lake Tahoe and that that I didn't discuss disappears in South Lake Tahoe. Donna Lass also coincidentally South Lake Tahoe hotel as Kane. - [Voiceover] That's crazy. - [Voiceover] But the last evidence Kane is about I haven't discussed yet. On the night of March near Patterson, California, baby were tricked into After entering the car, the was going to kill her and As the Zodiac was about to make the car and ran into a nearby escaped. Despite some believing this encounter, others believe a Quote, &quot;So I now have a &quot;woman plus her baby that I End quote. The reason I bring this Kathleen Johns, unlike most had extended face time with the Zodiac. This is important because of photographs, Kathleen pick out the man who tried to kill her. It was Lawrence Kane. - [Voiceover] I mean, that's - [Voiceover] But now let's proves Kane isn't the Zodiac. I couldn't find an instance recovered 2002 sample, nor Kane's fingerprint being found at the Paul Stine crime scene. Furthermore, Kane's to the Zodiac's, but also Additionally, Kane, much matches the description of murder scene, but does not description of the Zodiac in Now that you've heard all the stories, who do you think did it? - I think those two at the But I think the real answer one person and then a copycat, as well. - It's possible, in my mind, killer for the first three, stopped, and then Lawrence Kane - Oh, well then yeah. - It seems like to me he was like asking to get caught almost. - He was playing that line. He was tired with like, &quot;gotten away with it,&quot; he's &quot;that line?&quot; - That's true, yeah. Regardless, the case remains unsolved. And probably will stay - Trying to find this crime scene. No idea where the hell Do you keep getting hit by - No. - Calling all people right to us. - Seriously, dude, let's bit louder. This week on Buzzfeed fucking shadow? - No, there's no shadow. - That, for sure you heard that. Fuck you, you heard that for sure, right? (laughing) You fucking for sure - There's nothing, Ryan! - Is the back door open? - Our headlights are on. - We're on the side of a of the fucking night. - I heard crickets chirping and frogs. - Let's just fucking skedaddle on home. - Statistically speaking, safe right now. Did the killer live around here? We're right in the middle of this farm. Is this like his farm? Is he like no trespassers. - We're not doing this We'll be safe, I'm not died. - Alright, Buzzfeed Unsolved, I'm cutting. (mysterious music)
