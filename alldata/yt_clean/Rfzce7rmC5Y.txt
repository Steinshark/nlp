Just like any other video game, With the game's release all the way back in August of 2013, You jump over spikes and hurdles with the cube You dodge obstacles with the ship And you make it to the end of the level without dying. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Well nowadays it might seem like second nature, During the first month of the game's life, And if you were one of the lucky You could either try to beat user-made levels, But even with over 3,800 levels being released during this time, As a matter of fact, GD wouldn't see its first spike in difficulty when a player by the name of M2coL uploaded his new level, Not only was this a level of difficulty But this is the level that inspired the developer, RobTop, to create The demon. Ever since the introduction of this new rating, demons have slowly become the forefront of how people view and play Geometry Dash. And with the constant launch of new updates, there were more opportunities to make the Levels like "To The Grave" and "Extreme Park" are Both levels pushed the limits of what people and theories began sparking over how And this is where we introduce the level "Heaven and Hell". Released by Roadbose, this level's difficulty at the time No other level came even close to the demanding and punishing And this would be the very level that would kickstart an This is the beginning... of the &quot;Impossible Level Series&quot;. After the release of Heaven and Hell, numerous creators came out of the woodworks and sought an but to break the skill ceiling within the game. A perfect example of this was the Korean creator Sohn0924, Not only did this send waves throughout the community, but this had dethroned all other hardest demons by a long shot. But let's fast forward another 3 months to Update 1.6... When a creator by the name of &quot;Play 1107696&quot; released a level that would begin another colossal trend The level... was &quot;Silent Club&quot;. Now this... this was the definition of impossible at the time. To put into perspective how difficult this level was, we would see its first victor a staggering 7 years It was without a doubt one of the hardest things the And players would start to see a massive uptick in impossible From Silent Circles to Silent Processing to Silent Dicctras ( deg ? deg) You couldn't go a week without hearing a level called But, we're forgetting about one specific Silent level. This level transformed the idea of impossible levels And overtime became one of the most easily recognizable levels The level in question? It's none other... than Silent Clubstep. Silent Clubstep was a level created in Update 1.8 but later Name sound familiar? Well he did also collab with Cyrillic to make Silent Circles, But that was over a full year later, In mid 2014, Silent Clubstep was by far the most The level of precision needed to beat this almost seemed The number of frame perfect jumps and ridiculously hard And it had some of the hardest dual and straight fly parts that The idea of beating this level never crossed anyone's mind. People kinda just accepted the fact that this was But, that didn't stop people from playing it. The earliest instance of someone attempting Silent Clubstep was when the famous player and creator Zobros... beat the level in Practice Mode. In 2015, Zobros was known as one of the most So when he finished the practice run in 974 attempts, people got worried. In the 13 months following this run, However in November of 2015, a player named Icedcave This might seem like nothing, but at the time, It would take another 6 months before someone On May 16, 2016, a player by the name of Emirate would get 6% just barely making it into the infamous straight fly. But once again, progress would die down a lot, and we wouldn't see another big achievement for this level until As Update 2.0 was drawing to a close, the pro player scene had The best player at the time (according to the community) as he had just verified the hardest demon in the game, But just 3 days after verifying the level, he decided to do what Zobros had done a year and a half prior, and try to beat Silent Clubstep in practice mode. If you recall, the record to beat was 974 attempts, and Sunix absolutely crushed the record, beating in nearly less than half the attempts it took Zobros. 495 attempts That was the new record to beat. And it would stay this way for a long time... With the release of updates 2.1 and 2.11, With the addition of so many new features, and the unbelievable Silent Clubstep was kind of pushed to the side. But on June 10th, 2018... Silent Clubstep was awoken from its slumber. A fairly unknown player by the name of ERROR! got a new world record... 7% For the first time, someone actually made it a decent And for the rest of 2018, ERROR! would be the only player to make any more significant progress. 3 months after getting 7%, ERROR! would get a run of 33-51% on September 14th. [ERROR] &quot;Holy crap...&quot; &quot;That was pretty good.&quot; This was the first instance of somebody completing the mini ball and the UFO maze. This is considered one of the easiest parts of the level nowadays, but back then, it wasn't thought of like that. Then a week after, he would set a new practice mode record with 483 attempts, just barely beating out Sunix's record by 12 attempts. However, he was able to achieve this run with the help of a secret way that allowed him to skip the dual at 63%. And then it was 2019... But wait... There was actually another player who was grinding the level in practice mode as well. This record went under the entire community's radar, and with only 9 subscribers, the player PenguinLuigi set a new record of 438 attempts in practice. He shaved nearly a tenth of the attempts off the world record, and with only 6 views, this was one of the most underrated achievements up to this point in GD's lifetime. For the next 5 months, progress on Silent Clubstep would take place in the form of Practice Mode runs, just trying to lower the amount of attempts it took to finish a run. On February 7, 2019, the player Pirillkoly absolutely destroyed the previous record, achieving a 301 attempt practice run, lowering the old record by over 30%. And then, only 11 days later, the pro player Atomic, would lower the record AGAIN, with a 267 attempt run. Just to put into perspective how much the community progressed on this level, Atomic's record was a little over a quarter of the attempts it took for Zobros to complete it 4 years earlier. It was clear that progression on this level was not stopping anytime soon. After this insane progress, the practice mode phase died down for a little while, and people started working on passing separate parts in their entirety. One of the specific parts that players were trying to beat was the mini cube at 71%. But it was so widely known for its spine-chilling difficulty and the near frame-perfect timings, that it was dubbed the &quot;8 Jumps of Hell&quot;. Within the Race to Beat Silent Clubstep, there was also another race in progress... The Race to Beat the 8 Jumps of Hell. There were two main contenders that were racing to beat this challenge first: Icedcave and SeptaGon. Both of these players had immense progress, and it seemed that at any moment, either one of them could get the lucky attempt. But then out of nowhere, Someone beat it. &quot;I did it! I fucking did it!&quot; &quot;I did it!&quot; &quot;I actually did it!&quot; [VC] &quot;Congrats! Congrats!&quot; &quot;Oh my god, oh my god!&quot; You might be wondering... between the two of them, who was the winner of the race? Well... it was actually neither of them. This mysterious person who came out of nowhere and put the 8 Jumps of Hell to bed... Was a player by the name of &quot;AzaFTW&quot;. However, there was one minor problem... During Aza's completion, people began to realize that he was not playing the game mirrored like how the original part was, and players became hesitant about claiming Aza as the first victor. But only 2 days later, we would see the first completed run. Icedcave was able to get a 71-100% run, starting right before the 8 Jumps of Hell. Just like Aza, he didn't start before the mirror portal, but this was still a crazy achievement. Another 6 days passed, and we would have another world record run, 69-100%... achieved by the well-known creator and player, Stormfly. Not only did he set the record for the farthest run in the level up to this point, but he was officially the first player to complete the 8 Jumps of Hell with the mirror portal. Alongside the start of 2020, we would see a return to the Practice Mode attempts once again. The opening run came from the player FireSerpent9, who was able to drop the record down to 202 attempts. And nearly 3 months after, ERROR! would finally return to the level again, and he would get the first sub-200 run. But ERROR! wasn't ready to give up yet. He wanted to do something even greater. So the next day, he set the new hardest run... 67-100%. This is claimed to be the best run up to date, but only a month passed, and Icedcave had returned with a sign of vengeance. With a run of 24-51%, Icedcave took the record from ERROR!'s hands. But on June 8th, 2020, some crazy news would be announced... Salient had partnered with Icedcave, and together they updated the level to now make it possible on all refresh rates. Obviously this change came with some nerfs, but the level was still miles ahead of the hardest demon, which at the time was The Golden. Some people actually believed that the level was still humanly impossible, but after the new update, we were about to see a massive wave of new challengers. The first signs of progress would begin not even a day after the new version was released, when SeptaGon managed to get 62-100%, passing the extremely painful dual section. The day after, Icedcave would get 12-25%, and then the day after that, SeptaGon got 24-63%. Then the day after that, ERROR! would return to the level again, and would achieve the hardest run to date... 14-51%. Unfortunately for ERROR!, this record was short-lived, because only 6 days later on June 18th, SeptaGon would take back the record with a run of 48-98%. [SeptaGon] &quot;No! Nooo!&quot; &quot;No, I messed up the memory!&quot; &quot;Oh my god!&quot; He was so close to getting the furthest run to 100%, but there were some miscalculations in the cube maze at the end. But for the first time in quite a while, we would finally see a world record stay for longer than a week. But that reign... sort of came to an end? Well you see... SeptaGon got another world record, 9%, nearly making it to the end of the straight fly, which is insane. However, 9% is just barely easier than 48-98%. What that actually meant was that SeptaGon now held the 2 best runs on the level, which was an incredible accomplishment. Seeing someone do this well on a nearly impossible level must've made something click in players' heads, because 5 days after the 9% record, ERROR! would set a record of 9-25%, dethroning SeptaGon in less than a week. Then a week later, he would also pass quite a sizable amount of the middle section, getting a run of 24-66%. But 9-25% was still the run to beat, and for the first time since the nerfdate, progress wouldn't be seen every week. As a matter of fact, the level went nearly 2 months without anything... But on September 17, 2020, a new challenger was introduced. This player is considered by many to be one of the most important parts of the race to beat Silent Clubstep, setting countless records during 2020 and 2021. This... is Hyperbola. Hyperbola didn't actually start his progress in September of 2020. His first video on the level was actually 3 months earlier on June 11th, where he got 7%. Also, remember when I said the record at the time was 9-25%? Well, Hyperbola actually set a new record on July 8th, with a run of 5-11%, passing the entire ship corridor. You might be confused, how is a 6% run harder than everything else so far? Well, if you didn't know, the ship part at the beginning is the hardest part of Silent Clubstep... and it's not even close. I don't even have to ask any of the people in this race which part was the hardest, they would all say the straight fly. Two weeks after getting 5-11%, Hyperbola would tie the record from 0, reaching 9% alongside SeptaGon. But he wasn't gonna settle for just a tie... And 2 months later, the record would be broken. 11%. Someone had finally passed the straight fly. This world record really started to prove how difficult Silent Clubstep truly was. Even after the level got nerfed, people believed getting 11% was as hard as beating a Top 10 Challenge. But Hyperbola wasn't gonna stop. He wanted more progress... and a week later on September 24th, he got 9-25%, completing the rest of the predrop. This meant that he now held the record for the 3 hardest runs on Silent Clubstep. And soon enough, it would become the top 4. [Hyperbola] &quot;24-76...&quot; &quot;Or...&quot; &quot;Yeah I did it again.&quot; &quot;Yeah I can upload that now.&quot; &quot;GG.&quot; By the end of October, Hyperbola had 5 of the top 6 records, and it seemed as if his skill and determination was miles above the competition. And that statement would only prove to be more true in the following months. [Hyperbola] *gasp* &quot;I did 24-100%!&quot; &quot;Holy frick!&quot; (whispers) &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Hyperbola was unstoppable... Nobody was able to dethrone him. It had been over half a year since anyone else held the world record for this level, and he was all alone at the summit of Silent Clubstep. That is... Until January 17th, 2021... when a new player appeared from the shadows. Although he was seemingly unknown at the time, he would steadily become one of if not the most recognizable person when Silent Clubstep is brought up. Entering the race, is none other... than Vision. When talking about Vision's story with this level, we actually need to go back to September 2020, where he would post his first progress video of 67-100%. This was an impressive run no doubt, but it paled in comparison to other runs at the time. And seemingly out of nowhere on January 17, 2021, Vision would set the practice mode record of 78 attempts, dethroning ERROR!'s record of 183 after 8 months. Not only did he seemingly come out of the blue and break the record, but nobody had ever heard of him. But after this practice run, Vision would pop off. Within the first two months of his grind to beat Silent Clubstep, Vision started getting very noticeable progress. And what was even crazier, was his hardest demon was Bloodbath. That may seem like a pretty hard level, but compared to everyone else in the race, he was a dark horse candidate. Except, one of these players would slowly leave the forefront of the race. Just like that, we were back to a 1v1... and this was a back-and-forth battle for over 4 months. In a crazy turn of events, Vision was finally on top. With around 180,000 attempts, he was now the leader of the race. Except, it only lasted for a couple of hours... &quot;I got to the drop.&quot; - &quot;What?&quot; &quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Someone had made it to the drop. After 6 and a half years, the predrop was finally completed... But who was the one to do it? Well... It was actually neither of them. This pro player is in the top 100 best players in the world, and at the time, their hardest demon sat at #10 on the Demonlist. This... was Paqoe. The news spread like wildfire. How did another player just randomly join the race and set a world record as their first progress? And how did she manage to do it in only 11,000 attempts? It became obvious that Paqoe was the most dominant player out of the three. But after this, she wouldn't upload any more progress until 9 months later. If you recall, Vision got 16% the same day Paqoe got 25%. So if anyone were to break the record, it would be Vision. A week after getting 16%, he would get 24-100%. Surprisingly, this wasn't his hardest run, but he did tie Hyperbola's record for the longest run on Silent Clubstep. Another 3 weeks went by, and history was made again. [Vision] *gasp* &quot;What??&quot; &quot;I just got 27%!&quot; Vision had officially become the second person to make it to the drop on Silent Clubstep, and now held the world record of 27%. This also meant that he was the first person to have the level complete in 2 connected runs. But he wasn't done yet... [Vision] &quot;Woooow&quot; &quot;Oh my god...&quot; &quot;New best.&quot; After a quarter of a million attempts, the 30% barrier would finally be broken. People were enthralled by the amount of dedication Vision was putting into this level. And because of that, a lot of new players began their journey in Silent Clubstep. A big example of this would be the pro player Trick, who would start achieving runs a month after he finished verifying the level &quot;Firework&quot;. He managed to get some pretty impressive runs like 48-100%, 33-100%, and even 14-73% on December 22nd. But the biggest surprise was when he got a new best of 19%. This was the 3rd best run from 0, and he only started playing from the beginning 2 days prior. Alongside Trick, we saw some other new additions to the race. Diamond, the verifier of Sakupen Circles, achieved 24-100% on January 28, 2022, and SeptaGon returned to the level after a year and a half hiatus and also got 24-100% 9 days earlier, after a staggering 390,000 attempts. But while these new challengers were making their mark in the race, Vision and Hyperbola were silently grinding the level in the background. Hyperbola would actually get a new best of 17% on the 5th of December. And 2 weeks later, Vision would do this... [Vision] &quot;I did 14-100%...&quot; &quot;Oh my god!&quot; &quot;I did 14-100%!&quot; *heavy sigh* &quot;WHAT!?&quot; 14-100%... 86% of the level was completed without dying. That number just seems ridiculous. But surprisingly, this would only end up being the 3rd hardest run at the time. And as we went into 2022, things would only get crazier. On February 4th, Vision would get a new best... but not in normal mode, or from a run, or even in practice mode. He used a feature called &quot;NoClip Accuracy&quot;. For those who aren't aware of what NoClip is, it's a hack that allows players to phase through the hitboxes that would typically kill them. With the client "MegaHack", you can play an entire level with NoClip and see how precise your movements were, all with the help of this little button right here. It allows you to see your accuracy in one of the corners, and there's an additional option to see how many times you would've died. Vision decided to use "NoClip Accuracy" on Silent Clubstep, just for the heck of it, and he managed to get an accuracy of 99.94%, with only 7 deaths throughout the run. Although a run like this wouldn't place in the top 10, this was still very impressive nonetheless. While this was going on, we continued to see a multitude of players attempting the level. Most of the progress was pretty small, except on Valentine's Day 2022, when someone uploaded a video getting 25%, 24-97%, and also getting 99.91% using NoClip Accuracy. Just like Paqoe, this was their first progress video on the level, and they were officially the 3rd person to make it to the drop from 0. This was thiccboiparker. With all this new progress by up-and-coming players, Silent Clubstep's popularity was at an all time high. Hundreds of thousands of people gathered together to watch the verification finally come to fruition. It felt so close... yet so far at the same time. But the very next day... the community would be left in utter shock. [Vision] &quot;Woa--&quot; &quot;I got 65% on Silent Clubstep...&quot; &quot;I got 65!&quot; After 397,000 attempts, and over a year and a half later, Vision got 65%. It didn't seem real. It felt like just a short while ago when people were saying this level was never gonna be verified. But this... silenced any uncertainties about whether or not this level was really possible. Another 2 months passed, and nobody was even close to topping Vision's record. We would however see some decent progress from the other players. Trick was able to achieve a run of 14-95% on February 21st. Hyperbola became the 4th person to make it to the drop, getting 25% on April 1st. Thiccboiparker got 9-72% on April 16th. And the pro player Cursed managed to sneak in a run of 24-100% on the first of May. Vision's lead was slowly starting to diminish, so if anyone wanted a chance at claiming the world record, they would need to do it as soon as possible. And on May 19th, that's exactly what happened. [Paqoe] *gasp* &quot;WHAT!?&quot; Paqoe had returned once again. During that same day, she actually made it to the drop 16 times, and considering only 4 players had ever made it to the drop, it was clear that she would give Vision the most competition. And the very next day, she would get 2 more records. [Paqoe] &quot;62...&quot; &quot;65...&quot; - &quot;What?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; *sigh of relief* &quot;My f*cking god...&quot; &quot;There's no f*cking way.&quot; - &quot;There's no f*cking way.&quot; By a factor of 0.09%, Paqoe regained the lead in the race. And this would be the start of the final battle for the verification. Paqoe vs Vision It was only a matter of time before one of them would reign victorious. And on May 22nd, 2022, they were off to the races. [Paqoe] &quot;9-100%...&quot; &quot;The hell?&quot; The community was on the edge of their seats. Every day, these two players were spending thousands of attempts, inching closer and closer to perfection. The finish line was in plain sight. All that was left to do was cross it. And on July 17th, 2022, Silent Clubstep was defeated. [Paqoe] &quot;I VERIFIED IT!&quot; &quot;WHAT!?&quot; - &quot;That was from 0?&quot; - &quot;WHAT!?&quot; &quot;WHAT!? (x2)&quot; &quot;WHAT!? (x3)&quot; [VC] &quot;Okay?? What the hell?&quot; - &quot;Holy shit.&quot; &quot;WHAT!? (x4)&quot; &quot;WHAT!? (x5)&quot; &quot;Oh my god, I VERIFIED IT!&quot; &quot;That was so... oh my god.&quot; &quot;I verified Silent Clubstep.&quot; The race was over. After 138,000 attempts, Paqoe had verified Silent Clubstep. The level that people believed to be humanly impossible for years, had been beaten legitimately. 2,649 days was the total amount of time since Zobros got the very first sign of progress, and over 7 years later, Paqoe finally closed the book of the race to beat Silent Clubstep. With the verification now written in stone, more players than ever have picked up the level and started getting their own progress. As of the making of this video, no one else has beaten Silent Clubstep yet, but the race to become the first victor is finally starting to heat up. Trick managed to get 24-100% on July 20th. Xanii, the verifier of Sonic Wave Infinity, got 33-100% on July 24th. The pro player Zoink came out of nowhere and got 50% and 15-100% on July 22nd. Vision also beat his previous best by getting 72% on July 23rd, after 589,000 attempts. And Cursed did the unthinkable... achieving 74% on July 21st after only 25,000 attempts. Some people have even decided to go a step further and attempt to beat Silent Clubstep in its original, unnerfed form. Thiccboiparker has set countless records on the unnerfed version since February of 2022, such as 15-52%, 24-73%, 48-100%, and even 11%. Alongside him, Cursed has also shown signs of progress, achieving 9-25% on July 24th. The updated version of the level may have been verified, but... who knows? Maybe there's a new chapter in the book of Silent Clubstep... waiting to be written.
