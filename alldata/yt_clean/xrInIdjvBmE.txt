At the end of the 17th century, conquering was because the chief engineer of Louis created an almost infallible siege method that of fortress defense--increasingly engineers and tacticians devised a new system the polygonal fortress.

This type of resist heavy fire and bastions arranged to ensure from the defenders' canons. These elements made the star fortress reigned supreme. At the end of engineer Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban. a near-foolproof method of conquering these a network of trenches that allowed attackers to while strategically placed artillery ensured Vauban demonstrated the flawless execution of his just two weeks and with minimal losses. According siege warfare, Vauban created "the routine of the for the best part of two centuries." Even in reflect his influence, as shown by these maps the siege of Petersburg in the American Civil War. if properly executed rarely failed, so it posed of engineers. Some of the ideas they proposed to certain Monsieur Robillard, for example, suggested systematically blowing itself to pieces like the Marquis de Montalembert, finally came up with of the 18th century, this veteran, who was very (especially Vauban, Coehoorn, Waalrave, and polygonal fort. Although conservative engineers foolish notions of an upstart, similar concepts engineers, for example, developed what is known Engineers Jonathan Williams created a new form of ideas. So, what was the polygonal fort all about? "Artillery is the weapon which takes must defend them." This suggests that engineers massive artillery towers, detached forts, and on top of the defenses, guns were placed heavily fortified chambers with embrasures. for guns, bastions were abolished. The primary spots that attackers could exploit. In the wall were outfitted with a caponier, a massive both sides. The walls were also arranged so This change gave polygonal fortifications their this unrealized plan of the fortress of Cherbourg, Ramparts consisting of projecting and retracting A tenaille system occupies much less space than Because of this, polygonal fortresses often had fortifications in front of the main defenses. The hills, which expanded the radius of the defense An attacker had to fight through these outer This principle is known as defense in depth. Vauban's method of formal siege was incredibly numerous workers, and vast quantities of food, of the 18th and 19th centuries resorted to other there were four alternatives to the formal siege, surprise attack, assault, and bombardment. or stratagem was the most efficient option. allies attacked Cremona in 1702, for example, a an underground water conduit and opened a town and fought a fierce house-to-house battle retreat when their reinforcements arrived too history books as the "Coup de main of Cremona." With this approach, the enemy's position was forward with ladders and other tools to scale the but it almost always led to heavy casualties. and other small, fortified places but was rarely One of the few successful examples is the sieges of the Napoleonic Wars. After Wellington's 21 days and destroyed the wall in two places, the scale the walls. The French had been expecting the heavy barrage. Nevertheless, Wellington's troops 3,000 men within a few hours. Sadly, soldiers' Bombardments were far more promising and used quite common for the attacker to shoot over the and demoralize inhabitants and garrison. Just during the 1789 siege of Belgrade, where the the Ottoman defenders to a sustained barrage ordering his gunners to fire shells and bombs at finally surrendered. The most effective tool exploding bombs, which not only caused great A 17th-century eyewitness provides a "[The mortar bombs] climbed slowly to a then descended with increasing force ... and their weight sent them crashing through the When their filling exploded, the splinters roofs from the houses, smashing the timbers and An easier-to-handle alternative was heated or were heated over a fire and then shot immediately. and ignited any combustible material they touched. perfected this technique by constructing prototype to the British crown--in exchange for he actually managed to do within one year's time. attackers had to resort to more prolonged tactics formal siege was to surround the fortress and contravallation, just out of reach of the by the French during the siege of Philippsburg in the garrison, so-called sorties. Traditionally, a circumvallation, was built for protection starting in the 18th century, this approach was field armies that confronted approaching enemies a location under siege was critical because could often persevere for an extended period. for example, British ships broke through the the supplies and reinforcements they brought, Between the two lines of defense, the besiegers infrastructure: Military hospitals, supply and much more. The laboratory--the workshop prepared--was located slightly off to the side, The attack began by constructing a series of gun were set up in groups, so-called batteries. These prevent the heavy siege cannons from sinking them back into position quickly after firing. muzzle-loading bronze guns were increasingly were much more accurate and had a much longer explosive shells filled with high explosives led to the so-called "torpedo-shell crisis" into the fortifications and then exploded with a Prior to this development, however, the batteries crucial part of the formal siege--the construction were detached forts, the attackers had to deal outer ring sometimes required a separate siege, from the contravallation to the detached forts and capturing just one to three forts was enough flanked by the adjacent defensive positions. fortifications in front of the city if necessary. as saps, toward the town. Saps were constructed enfilading or firing along the length of the firing range, the first parallel was dug. As the fortress wall. These fortified lines provided positions for additional batteries, and shelter the first parallel was complete, the besiegers places, dug a few hundred meters closer to which was again fortified and equipped with built just before the glacis, the slope at the formal approach brought great success was the the German general August von Werder bombarded formal siege. His men systematically dug their and breached two bastions. With their When strictly following Vauban's methods, the as long they made no mistakes. They could work and the garrison couldn't do much about tried to destroy the besiegers' batteries systems with countermines, and push them back as they required part of the garrison to leave serious damage--such as breaking through the siege of Gibraltar showed just how decisive this to conquer "the Rock," as Gibraltar was called, in additional batteries to target the previously defenders knew this would be fatal and launched a the Spaniards in the trenches.

As Christopher Duffy explains, battle because the attackers lost many of their above, it was difficult to prevent an enfilade provide limited support. If the gunners were same fate as the Duke of Berwick at the siege cannonball from his own camp. These problems could the miners dug a tunnel starting at the base of walls, where they placed several precisely there was "a frightful crash, shaking the like an erupting volcano," as reported by an When the trenches reached the covered way, it troops were experts with hand grenades, which storm the covered way.

Counterbatteries were used to a final artillery duel while the powerful breach by bombarding the walls continuously. could take several days for the cannonade to trenches to cross the ditch.
