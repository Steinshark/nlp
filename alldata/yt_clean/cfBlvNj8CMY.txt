Can you drive a car on wood wheels? Today we're pushing the limits with How many skulls can stop a bullet? What happens if you swipe What can you cut with a paper saw? What happens if you hit the Which material makes the sharpest knife? And finally, we'll put those wood wheels For the first experiment, If a multi headshot is actually possible. We see a bunch of clips of people But is that actually We're gonna start off with a slingshot, then go to a pew pew. We have seven skulls there. Safety guard goes on, everyone. 3,2,1. Did it? I wonder where it went. That's only possible to see on slow mo, here we go. Oh, it didn't even penetrate the skin. We have to go upgrade our weapons now. Oh it hit it. Let's move on to our stronger weapon, This has a draw force of 45 pounds. Do you think this will penetrate? Let's load her up. And we're good to shoot. Safety off. I think it will. 1,2, 3. Buddy is Ko'd, but it didn't penetrate He just has an arrow This is a final boss. Let's see how many skulls Are we ready? I think we're ready. We only got one shot at this, Three, two, one. Let's see. It's a bullet right there. Look. Oh, that's part of it. I wonder where the rest of it ended up. Just completely squished. Got more shrapnel over here. This is a part of the in the brain... Whoa. That was... straight in the cranium, dude. And you can see. See the, like, skin jiggle upwards? I didn't know the skin And now it's leaking. That's crazy, dude. I guess you can't get a For this next experiment, we're gonna find out what happens if that's moving faster than a bullet. So now we're gonna use a water jet to end with cutting a realistic human hand. Water jet versus carrot. Let's see it. All right. Goodbye, carrots. Oh, my gosh. Just cut clean off. Crazy. Let's try something else next. We just gotta test the metal. See how that does? All right, firing in Three, two. Whoa. Whoa, it feels hot. We got some scrapes. Okay, here's what we need. We need to turn on the garnet. This time, Oh, I think it's going through. Oh. dude. I felt sand blasting me in the face. Yeah, you don't wanna stand too close. We're definitely in the splash zone here. But I never knew water could be this strong. Now we gotta try something even harder. Water jet versus obsidian. Yo. That went through so quick. Like a hot knife through butter. Next we have the ballistic hand. The skin and meat is which is basically mimicking muscle. And then inside, we have bones as well. Will it survive? Here we go. Let's do one finger first. You're definitely going Let's cut here where there's bone. This is interesting, All I did was rip through the skin, Now I'll try going a little slower and try slicing off the palms. All right, here we go. Oh, gosh. Every time it went through a bone, because it's kind of struggling cutting through the flesh. I think, if you swiped your hand, like, because your reflex will In that case, what would happen is you'll but not your bones. You could probably survive a water jet. Okay, because you won't need it anymore. We got cook unity. This is something new you gotta try. It's the first chef to They have over 70 chefs that from italian to indian. Each week, you can select from seven including vegan, and gluten. Free meals are delivered fresh, This is a medium steak. You usually don't get that And the menu rotates every week, Subscriptions are super flexible. You can pause, or cancel anytime. Some meals I got this week Chicken burrito by Jose Garces Adobo, and the meatballs with le febre. The steak one is definitely my favorite. I love how fresh and I love cookunity, because all the meals are made from than if you ordered takeout. If you want to try a box for yourself, Or click the link in the description for 50% off your first order. I promise you it will be worth a try. For this experiment, we're going to find out Normally, a piece of paper can't cut But since we attached the paper should be able to I brought you my biggest cucumber. It's pretty small. I don't know, man. It's pretty big to me. You gotta work with what we got. So all we gotta do is insert our cucumber, clamp it down with this so it And I'm using the voltage controller. As I turn it up, All right, and the max is what? 130. 130. No, nothing. Okay, we gotta go. Max speed. We're maxing it out. Oh, no. That was scary. Since our one piece of paper broke, This paper is less thin, Oh, it's cutting. All right. Oh, it's working, it's cutting! It needs more power. Yeah, we need more power. There we go. Now it's working. Oh, yeah. Paper cuts pretty well. Let's try something harder. This is paper saw blade versus apple. Oh, it's making that noise. Oh, no, the blade bent. That's crazy. We got a bent cut. I mean, that's what you get right? I think some of this mush. Is the paper melting. Let's try something even harder. Now, this is paper saw, blade versus wood. Let's see what is breaking here. Is that the wood or is that the paper? Oh, wait. I think this can cut through Let's try to cut through Yo, it's, like, polished. Yeah, it's, like, smooth. The black here is because there paper was burning the wood. I think the last thing Don't breathe that. Oh, that's where we try to cut. It is extremely hot right now. Actually, this was the original size. This is the saw blade. Now, it's a lot easier to But with the metal, Therefore, All right, Now we're going to test This is the world's heaviest baseball, and there's only one of and it's made by my friend Tell me more about this. This is tungsten. It's about the heaviest metal That isn't uranium, I made one with kind of and it was pretty heavy, So we contacted a factory in China, and it cost us, $500. So let's see how much this actually weighs. A normal baseball weighs 140 grams. This is another one. What is this? This is pure steel. And that's four pounds and 4oz, which is 1820. 6 grams. And this is the tungsten baseball. Let's see how much this weighs. 4300 grams. This is world's heaviest We're gonna drop it from this height. One, two, three. Whoa. Oh. I heard it splat on the walls. How's the taste? Got a pretty juicy melon. Let's try something even harder. Now let's see if it can And baseball bats are mostly made of wood, 3, 2,1. Gosh, hurt my ears. Yeah. Now we got a coconut, So give this a test. One, two, three. Whoa. Oh. I did not expect that That's crazy. Now we have a feel of how Let's go play test it. Now we're at the baseball diamond to see I've never hit a baseball in my life, I agree. So let's just do a Is that normal baseball? Oh, yo, I'm built for this. Then we got a wood bat and a metal bat. So we'll do the wood bat first. Then we got a wood bat and a metal bat. So we'll do the wood bat first. Oh, man. When I was hitting it, It kind of hurt. Our wood bat is obviously destroyed, We'll see what happens. This might hurt me. All right, here comes a real heater. Oh, man, that hurt. It made a giant dent on the baseball bat. That was basically like And let's see the ball. There's literally no damage on the ball. Man, I love your ball. Yeah. How's your hand? If there's one thing I It's heavy balls. Let's swing onto the next experiment. Now, we have a collection of knives made by because we're trying to find out to make a knife out of. So let's do some tests. This is a fresh surgery scalpel. Scalpels are made to be incredibly sharp, it could cause additional bleeding So what we'll do is we'll Whoa... It's so sharp. Dude, tell me about this knife. This knife is made of amethyst. It's a pretty hard mineral. It dulled all my sanding blades so it was really hard to work with. So, in theory, harder should be sharper. But we'll see. That was okay. You kind of gotta, like, use force. It's not really slicing like, Tell me about this. This is opalite. It is a man made material, which is another gemstone Aesthetics mean a lot, so we'll give it a test. This is not a great knife, I gotta tell you. This opalite is extremely wide. This is extremely cool. It looks like something you It is. Yeah. This is the prestige ten skin you unlock. This is a custom handle I made with So it has a cool little pattern on there. This is nice. What is this? I have high hopes for this one Okay. That's not bad, It's more of, like, a chop action. Next we have a meteorite knife. Tell me about this. This knife is really unique, because this pattern on here It can only happen if iron cools So it's literally impossible unless it's a meteorite. Considering it's also thin. Let's see how it slices. Whoa. That's nice. That meteor knife is nice, man. Lastly, we have what the Internet says is and that's obsidian. Some surgeons actually use scalpels it's even sharper than steel. Really? Let's give it a test. What? This is the dullest? Mmm... Man. And it appears that this knife is maybe more for show. This obsidian knife is literally the I have a backup plan. Is that real obsidian? This is pure obsidian. That is so cool. I've never handled real obsidian... Oh. Whoa. We just made a huge It's actually incredible how big this is. I think they should be able to Yeah. This is crazy. Here we go. Obsidian blade versus cucumber. Oh, that is smooth, bro. That is so smooth. Ooh, baby. So, the answer to our question. What's the sharpest material in the world? It's metal. Maybe there's a reason we've been Don't reinvent the knife. Now we're gonna test can Wood wheels worked on ancient vehicles, To test that, we made wheels by Taking thick pieces of wood and spreading After our wood is glued together, Then we added small holes in the wheels to our forward pinto. All right, that's the last one. It started at one. It's now 9:12. So it's been 8 hours. It only took eight extra hours, but. We got the four wheels installed. The car is built. I got my cowboy hat on. It's time to put it to Daniel, you ready? I'm excited. I'm ready. Oh, wow. This ride's low. This car is so old that it has a lap belt. Safety first. Safety first. Except for our wheels, bro. All right. All right. Here we go. Oh, yeah. We have lift off. This is a bumpy ride. How them wheels doing? Sounds a little rough. So we have a series of durability First up is that pothole over there. Okay, here we go. Oh, it hurts driving this. Oh, it wasn't that bad. Surprisingly good. It's almost like driving Car tires were made from wood originally, Curious to see why they Cause these are performing You like our car? It's a two by four? Yeah. This is better than a hummer. Hello, boys. Yeah, you need one of these. It's a people pleaser. It's a showstopper. Now it's time for a donut test. Yeah, let's... Hold on. This is a traction test over here. Oh, my goodness. This sounds so wrong, I'm gonna try a trip. Okay. Here we go. All right, let's go for a turn. That was a trip, bro. We lost some we lost wood. How is it there? Is it bad? Oh, there it is. It's worrisome. All right. Acceleration and brake test. Alright, accelerating now. Oh, that is fun. I'm pressing all the way down the brake. That is a little scary. Our next test coming up is we gotta go through our drive through. Here we go. We're driving into Wiener schnitzels. Hello. Yeah, can we get an extra large wiener? Yo, we got so many cars looking at us. We got the whole gang. Yo, look over there. The entire red light just staring at us. That dude in the Silverado is filming us. Hello there. Can I take a picture? Yeah, of course. Hello. You like our car? We are getting so much attention. Thank you. Thank you. Off to the next stop at We got to do an off road test... All right. What was that? Did someone. Oh, wait. Stop, stop, stop. Something broke. Yeah, I think it definitely broke. Our back wheel is broken right now. It's split in half. We have two options. We can either call the tow truck, What do you think? I said we put on a spare. I thought that was our last wheel. All cars come in the spare. You know what I'm saying? All right, man. Brother, let's. There we go. Nailed that. Okay, we good to go? We're off again. All right. Pulling out. Oh, yeah. That back wheel feels smooth. Why don't we just go Okay, now we're coming up on the obstacle. We got massive speed bumps ahead. Will the wood wheels make it? Oh, that feels pretty good. No problems here. Every time we go over, my heart stops a beat because Okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay, hold on... That does not sound good. I think we're okay. We are alive. A busy round. We're okay. Oh, dude. That was the scariest thing Careful not to splash. Oh, what was that? Oh, no. Same exact thing happened. This feels pretty sturdy right now. I think we can go. Let's go. Off roading. All right, Daniel. We're on our last two legs. That's an off road right there. A giant pothole waiting for us to conquer. Can we just full send it? I think we can do it. If our wheel breaks, it breaks. All right, here we go. Full speed. God speed, brother. Hope we will survive. God speed, brother. Oh, yeah. Off road baby. Oh, there it goes. There goes our last wheel. I am stuck in a lake, bro. This is what's left of our wood wheel. Let's go assess the damage over there. We are 100% stuck in this. Look, our wheel is submerged here. Honestly, these front wheels are It's just the back wheels You can put wood wheels it looks like. Yeah, if wood is breaking. What if we use a harder material, Daniel made more crazy so click here to check it out, I think that could work.
