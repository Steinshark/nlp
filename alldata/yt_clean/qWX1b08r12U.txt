- Welcome to the VIP Outlet. So we took a look at this site last year and they had some surprisingly good deals. And when you consider how many sites like this that we review, VIP Outlet, I'll say like has pretty consistently But today we're going to be looking for some of their best deals in gaming. Now if you have familiar that has been returned from So there are some new items, but a lot of them are But at least if our last some of these deals What is a wearable power Do you listen to your AirPods so much that you need to have a battery bank around your neck for them? I'll game on AirPods. That counts, right? This is the &quot;Smash Brothers&quot; bundle with the custom Switch Joy-Cons, which is available refurbished. Didn't this just come out? How'd they already have Oh, they're selling &quot;Concord.&quot; &quot;Concord&quot; is a Sony game that lasted all of two weeks And Sony said, hey, forget Wii Fit U. It's not often that I get to see a Wii And apparently this comes What happens if I look for Oh it broke! Okay, I found a Nintendo 3DS. So this is the original model for $177. Now $366 sounds like a until you read the fine print. 'Cause this is powered by Ryzen Z1, not the Z1 Extreme No, this is the Z1. A lot of door handles. I'm sorry, do cats drink out of fountains? What do we have for laptop Okay, I'm not sure why I opened that tab. I'm going to close it immediately. Lionsgate &quot;Wolf Hound&quot; DVD. What is this? - [Joanna] It's James from - [Alex] It sounds like you want to buy- - Moving on. Yeah, I see how Oh no, not Cocomelon. It's a great day on Coco... With that my friends, I think to carefully evaluate whether or not VIP Outlet will send us to the back room I gotta change my metaphors. We'll be right back after I learn what VIP-ing Now VIP-ing also sounds... Huge thanks to RingConn The RingConn Gen2 Smart Ring recently raised over $4 And after wearing it daily I can see why. What stands out is how normal it looks. According to RingConn, it's the thinnest and and it really could It's both water and dust proof and the battery life is impressive. I've gotten a full week of 24/7 wear with just a few minutes of charging needed for a full day's use. And when you do need to charge up, the charging case has enough One of the standout features which RingConn says and can run automatically while you sleep, pending FDA clearance. The app is surprisingly in depth too with some great insights. And best of all, there is Yep, zero. Imagine that. Wanna try it for yourself? Check out their Black Friday using the link in the description. And thank you very much to RingConn for sponsoring this video. My VIP status has been confirmed. We were able to get a from VIP Outlet. But there's a couple of these This is our refurbished ROG Ally. - [Ken] Oh. - Now it does say it is in Grade A and it is fully functional. We purchased one that and the order got canceled, so then I rebought a second - [Alex] But the second one that we bought was actually the same price for $387. - So screen looks good, Smells like Bentonville. - Bentonville, Arkansas. So this came out, I and it was maybe less Had some driver issues at the beginning. The SD cards tended to run warm and the battery life was The problem though was that this is powered Meaning that most people they spent the extra a hundred dollars to get like three times more performance. But this is still, I think, a little bit more - [Ken] And you get - [Austin] You can-ish. - So let me set this up, and we'll see just how powerful As you'll see, we have set up for this next item. Ken, I have a question for you. Okay, what is the hottest that the kids are dying to play on the professional PlayStations? - Is it &quot;Horizon One Dawn?&quot; - Would you care to join that is truly going to revolutionize the PlayStation platform? - Is it &quot;Gran Turismo 8?&quot; You know what? I'm not I wanna pop the disc in. - Feel free. - Just show the audience and don't look at it yourself, okay? So show them what we're looking at. - [Alex] Well it is sealed. - [Austin] You're looking at it backwards, so yeah, flip it around. Well it's got a huge sticker on it. - It is the shooter of the century, greatest gameplay of It's actually free to play Ah! - The game of the year. &quot;Concord&quot; available brand new from VIP- - Wait, I thought you couldn't, I thought you couldn't buy this in, oh. - Take a look on the - They spent like hundreds on this thing. - And now we have the benefit of potentially playing nothing with it. - All right, should we - Yeah, go for it. - All right, here's the code. You can download the - [Joanna] Well if you would - [Alex] I don't think that- - [Joanna] Hold on. Everyone be quiet. I'm gonna make sure - How much did I pay for this copy brand new - [Alex] Honestly a lot - [Ken] Wow! - Almost retail. - So while we wait for to install on our probably the first time anyone's ever put these why don't we play on our ROG Ally? So I'm gonna try to and see if it actually works. So the display is great and the display is the as well as the newer versions. Not only the Z1 Extreme I like the white sort of colorway. My big downside here is that After trying the Ally X, it feels so much more What the hell? Is Snoop - [Ken] Yeah. - [Alex] Snoop Dogg, Ice - [Austin] Wow. - It's at the medium settings. What the? No, no, no, no, no, we're going down. So I'm playing right now but it's 1080P upscaling So outta curiosity, how much could I find an ROG or Z1 Extreme? - [Alex] Ooh, I don't You can pretty much get a used or refurbished Z1 Extreme version for like $400 on eBay. - [Austin] Really? - Oh, so we just should not - [Ken] Wait, is &quot;Concord&quot; starting? - [Alex] It is starting. I'm getting a Victory Royale right now. - [Joanna] We don't care. - [Ken] Yeah. Error. Oh. - [Alex] Oh, well. - [Ken] &quot;It has been taken oh, I couldn't even read it. - Anyway back to my &quot;Fortnite.&quot; Okay, I have a problem. I can see someone in the distance, but my draw distance is so - [Ken] I can smell like it is exhausting all of its- - [Austin] Yeah it is. Joanna, can you confirm that I'm absolutely killing it right now. - [Joanna] You killed one bot. - I've killed three bots The only thing I will say is that VIP Outlet did say and this does look like it Oh. No! No! No! So this next item, if it is what i think it When was the last time - [Ken] Oh! This my friends is a Nexus 7, I would argue still the greatest This was a $200 Android tablet that importantly has a which meant that even though Android apps were very bad on tablets at the time, this could run pretty This is Grade A fully This is still completely factory sealed. How much do we pay for the Nexus 7? 'Cause I actually did not I thought it was just the - [Alex] We paid $66 for it. - For a brand new in Yo! Well actually is that - So I think they resealed it. - Oh. - [Alex] We bought it and the condition says refurbished. - Here's the thing, if none of what we're saying I'm sorry that you weren't on but this was the (quack). Nexus, Nexus, Nexus, Nexus! I made so many videos back in like 2013 and I made several, several - [Ken] Man, this is- - Look the old YouTube logo. So if we open that YouTube app, I guarantee it'll not do anything. Yeah, you should install It actually doesn't feel that slow, although it's not working. That's unfortunate. Oh, it's ask me to sign into Google+, let's take a look at our It was ready to take the photo, then it pushed him outta That was a funny thing- - That's an aesthetic photo - Did do it? - Here's the thing, This is delightful and incredible. No apps are gonna support, even if this thing is I think it's gonna be really tricky. But man, you talk about like how many tech YouTubers started out with a Nexus 7 as one Hey, cowards at Google, This my friends is a copy of Wii Fit U. You may recall Wii Fit was a for the original Wii that allowed you to get But you may not know that they also made a You also may not know I actually think that this - [Alex] We bought it for $52. - That's slightly more - [Alex] Yeah. - But you know what? That's fine. 'Cause this comes not only with the Wii U but importantly our all new Fit Meter. - [Ken] Okay. - I think they accidentally with Pokemon Soul oh well we'll just throw We've got ourselves, our sealed original batteries We also have a copy of - My Prices is Right hat says this is gonna be something like 150 bucks. - Yeah, I would think so, right? Nintendo collectors are real particular. I'm talking about Will. Just imagine Will has a basement like Super Nintendo games or something. - [Alex] You can get it- - [Alex] For like 30. - Oh no, wait, really? - [Joanna] Yeah, but do - Yeah, what about my So we have successfully paired the game works, so let's give it a try. I dunno why they've made the balance board like a little duder? Like he's just there wiggling. Our posture's been getting worse. What are you talking about? - [Ken] A little lower, lower, lower. - Five eleven. - Push the power button with - [Ken] Oh no, you use - [Austin] Oh, I can take photos. Okay. - [Ken] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - [Austin] Let's do it. Okay, the weight of the game pad will be subtracted from our results. Thank you, appreciate that. - [Ken] That's actually kind of cool. - Wow. Disturbing. Yes. You Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, that sounds about - [Ken] Ooh. - I'm a certified balance boy. Oh, I'm about to find out my - [Ken] Is it like dog years? - [Ken] Wait, actually- - [Austin] Wait, that's just my age. What? - It's gonna be like. Why did- - Oh. - Why did he get heavier all of a sudden? - Do single-leg extension, This is upward facing dog. - Oh, I feel it in my leg. I don't think I'm supposed to do that. - [Announcer] Let's - Wait. I'm stretching my leg. She getting mad at you. You're - My knees. - [Ken] Wait, wait, - What can we say about this copy of Wii I feel like you look like If only there were some reasons on why people didn't Like you know, not knowing it existed. All of the items we've gotten while maybe not the have been in good shape and there's also a including the anti-lost for your neck. The way this works is that it plugs into the charges them while I really struggle with who needs to listen to their AirPods for so long, but they say anti-lost, they My thought is that it's going to help them not fall out of your ears because if they fall, they're just gonna fall and dangle instead of be lost down a This is like 15 bucks or something? - [Alex] 20 bucks. So I'm assuming that Oh yeah, that's not going anywhere. How do I know that the Lemme just pull up the settings I don't know. Oh, we're down to 99%. So it is actually not charging right now. So according to this, it doesn't actually charge your AirPods until they go below 50%. While I try to burn my AirPods down, let me listen to some Okay, I need to find a quiet place where I can focus and take the test. And my results are little to no loss. Damn, I don't have an So I'm just gonna do my best See how this works. - [Alex] I have no idea what kind of dance moves these are. - [Joanna] It kind of reminds that they have in Home Alone. - Nope, doesn't work. If this is the product that you've been looking for in your life, can you please let me - [Alex] You've essentially spent $20 to turn AirPods into EarPods. - So it has been 24 hours. I have left the AirPods out of the case. So they have drained like roughly 30%. I have now plugged it into but are they charging? It beeped for a second, This charged my left AirPod for one second and then it beeped and it turned back off. And no matter how many this is no longer coming back to life. I think it's a dumb idea, but more importantly I because the AirPods aren't and while they technically They get very, very upset about it. So maybe, just maybe leave the to your buddy Austin. I'll let you know when it's worth it, and in a case like this, in which I don't think Next up we have ah, our Nintendo 3DS. And unlike our Nexus 7 that this comes to us in Grade C. We do have a 3DS style charging cable and our metallic red but that's not terrible on the top. I mean that's all just, you No cracks, no deep scratch. It's just all surface level Little bit of a residue on the display. I think it's a little scratch, but that scratch actually looks like it's just And we're going through the setup. Wow. Do we have a game for this? - [Alex] We have sort of a game. Oh, sorry. - Oh, right. This is our that we got from Wish. Don't mind the fact that there's a micro SD card on the back, it's a new Nintendo 3DS cartridge. So let me load up a game, And we'll investigate. There's nothing inserted - [Alex] Is it just fiddly? - No, it's stuck. Oh, uh-oh, uh-oh. Oh, you know what? It works You know what? I'll give It does work, you just have to be a little It just feels like it needs on those little swingy bits - [Alex] I'm getting a lot Don't do what he says. - [Austin] Don't WD-40 it. Of course, it's our How much do we pay for, oh, I just realized. - [Alex] It wasn't supposed to be or they didn't mention that at all. - Well the thing is, 3DSs So I don't think there's a downside to it. - [Alex] We paid $177. - So more expensive than This doesn't fill me with I think I could fix it if Alex would let me - [Alex] You could do that's yours buddy. I was about to do a Hawk Tuah meme, but I'm not gonna do that, no. We got a copy of &quot;Wolf Hound.&quot; Why do we have a copy of &quot;Wolf Hound?&quot; - [Joanna] Oh, it's this, it's this. - Joanna, did you order - [Joanna] Yeah, you agreed - I did? I don't know if, I don't think that's- - [Joanna] I bet it's worth - I'm charging that to your - [Joanna] Okay. I have - But importantly we have My Cocomelon jukebox. - [Alex] Are you just shopping for your kid's Christmas presents? - No, because I'm opening it right now. Is everyone ready for a Check, check, check. Nope. Hello? - [Ken] Oh, yeah. Welcome to Cocomelon Lane! The wheels on the bus Round and round, round and round The wheels on the bus All through the town Tearing up a little bit. It's an emotional performance for me. I feel like, you know, I'm have to listen All right, we're down to our last item. I forgot I ordered this. Behold my friends the Nintendo Switch. This is the limited edition of the Switch. Not to be confused with the current &quot;Smash Brothers&quot; version, which is just a regular Switch. I think that they put the game in. So it's a Switch OLED and it comes with a full downloadable copy of &quot;Smash Brothers Ultimate&quot; and three months of Nintendo Online. So if you look on the side, it because it is one of their returns. If only it was a Switch but you know, we all gotta - [Alex] You would rather - [Austin] Yeah, I use my Switch Lite. I don't use a Switch OLED. - What the, it's like, it's I don't know if this is gonna be, uh-oh. Yeah dude, both of the sticks look like they've been actually used, like you can see there's like little indents in where they've been like What? Wait. - This is a regular looking Switch. Well I thought it had, Wait. Oh no, no, I'm stupid. No Oh wait, I thought I got the other one. Is there a code for the game in here? - [Alex] We'll see. - Surely there's a code for Where's my my full game I want my three months of - [Alex] This might - I have made a grave error. So little update for you as you there was no code for my and, of course, it was a download and not an actual physical card as well as my three And lo and behold, if you fire up the Switch And lo and behold, if you there is no copy of &quot;Smash&quot; to be found. I can't be too upset with that did not come with the digital goods that it promises on the box. What I think actually happened here, was that some enterprising Timmy out there bought himself a Switch OLED at Walmart took out the codes, redeemed them, and then returned it got will be forced to play &quot;Legend of Zelda: Tears of I'm gonna have to play I will say that the Switch itself is, again, like most items from VIP Outlet, essentially immaculate, right? Like there's nothing And how much, may I ask, did we pay for our special-ish Switch? Which looks like I just took a Sharpie and made it in about 30 seconds. - [Alex] We paid $314. - So I saved $35 by getting this used. And I missed out on my $60 game download plus three months of Switch Online, huh. That seems not worth it. Now what do I have to I think when we took a there were a lot of terrific deals and the items that we got were but this second time around, obviously deals come and go, that's fair. I don't like it as much. I feel like the deals there was a lot less selection. Like it took me a lot longer versus last time where all over the place. There's a little bit less which means that VIP Outlet, Get back in line like the rest of us. - [Joanna] Well, there might be one particular a certain movie you haven't watched yet. - Damn it. Oh, you shot your buddy. He looks really sad, I I've not owned a DVD in a long time. This case so flimsy. I can Do you see? Look. I mean DVD is the only High definition? 4K? 480i is where it's at.
