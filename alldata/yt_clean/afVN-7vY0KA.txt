(logo chiming) - [Jon] The first book in - [Tim] And we're gonna look closely at the first page of the book of Genesis. It's a carefully crafted narrative about God creating and - [Jon] Okay, let's check it out. Now, the opening line &quot;In the beginning God created the skies and the land.&quot; - [Tim] Now your Bible &quot;The heavens and the earth.&quot; In Biblical Hebrew, the word for &quot;heaven&quot; refers And the word for &quot;earth&quot; but rather &quot;the land.&quot; - [Jon] The ground below us. - [Tim] Right. what's going to happen in which starts in the next line. - [Jon] And it reads: &quot;Now the land was wild and waste.&quot; - [Tim] This phrase rhymes in Hebrew. &quot;The land was tohu va-vohu,&quot; which means &quot;unordered and uninhabited.&quot; This is the ancient way of talking about the pre-creation state, what we might call &quot;nothingness.&quot; For the biblical authors, non-existence means &quot;having And the next line uses another image to say the same thing. - [Jon] &quot;And darkness was on the face of the deep abyss.&quot; What's the deep abyss? - [Tim] Yeah, it's It's another common way the non-reality that preceded creation. Now, here's where things because in the midst of those dark waters, God is present. - [Jon] &quot;And the over the face of the waters.&quot; - [Tim] The Hebrew word which can refer to wind or breath, or God's invisible presence. - [Jon] So you can't see it, but God is present in the darkness, ready to bring order so - [Tim] Yes. And in a series of six days. - [Jon] Each day &quot;And God said,&quot; and then ends with the phrase, &quot;and there was evening and morning.&quot; - [Tim] Yeah, every day addresses those problems introduced in verse 2, that there's no order and no inhabitants. So on days one through three, God splits apart that unordered darkness into three ordered realms. Then, on days four through six, God fills the uninhabited - [Jon] Interesting. - [Tim] Okay. So begins with light on day one. - [Jon] Ah, yes. - [Tim] This is that fills and contains the darkness. As he separates day from night, God's establishing the order of time. - [Jon] Okay. And then on day two, &quot;Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.&quot; What's the vault? - [Tim] In the ancient culture of the biblical authors, the sky was perceived as a solid dome that holds back waters. God's depicted here as in half, above and below, which creates the realms - [Jon] And then on day three, &quot;Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, and let dry ground appear.&quot; - [Tim] God is establishing and it emerges out of the chaotic waters. And then there's a bonus God invites plants and to emerge out of the land. - [Jon] Okay. So we've the realm of the sky and the seas, and the land. And they all have order. - [Tim] Right. Now, it's time to go back of days one through And this is what happens - [Jon] So on day four, &quot;Let there be lights in - [Tim] God installs these lights, the sun, moon, and stars, as signs and symbols that He gives them his own royal - [Jon] Then on day five, &quot;Let the waters swarm and let birds fly above the land.&quot; - [Tim] Yeah. These are the creatures that live in the waters below, and those that fly near the waters above. - [Jon] Then finally, on day six, &quot;Let the land produce living creatures.&quot; - [Tim] They emerge to live on the land. And then, matching that bonus God makes a special land creature, human, or in Hebrew,'adam. Then, God provides all of those plants from day - [Jon] Now over and over, God says what he created was good. But then, after making humans, God says that it is very good. - [Tim] Yes, humanity is the climax of days one through six, and their importance is explained in the first poem in the Bible. - [Jon] &quot;So God created In the image of God, he created them; male and female, he created them.&quot; - [Tim] So humans like the other land creatures, but they're also more. They're God's image, which means that, together, men and women embody and represent the - [Jon] &quot;God blessed and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it, ruling over the creatures.'&quot; - [Tim] This is the to oversee creation as God's partners and representatives in the world. - [Jon] Very cool. - [Tim] Now, after the six days, we get a concluding line that links back to the keywords of the opening line. - [Jon] &quot;And so were completed the skies and the land and - [Tim] Except there's one more day. It stands outside the pattern It's the big climax. - [Jon] &quot;And God the work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work which he had done, and God blessed the seventh - [Tim] So God This is a standard after ordering the cosmos, comes to rest and dwell It's like the whole world is a holy temple where God lives with his people. - [Jon] Now that phrase, &quot;There was evening and morning,&quot; it doesn't appear on day seven. - [Tim] That's right. That's because Genesis 1 is for the whole cosmos. - [Jon] A place where to rule the world in harmony forever. - [Tim] Yes, the seventh It's actually so important that the author of Genesis 1 has woven the number seven into every part of the story. There are seven days of creation, seven announcements that creation is good. There are seven Hebrew and then two times seven And then the statement has three lines of seven words. - [Jon] Wow. So the doing way more than just telling - [Tim] Right. to show us that God's purpose is to share creation with his images, so they can rest and And that purpose is what the rest of the biblical drama is all about.
