They have so few people. How dare they to invade the territory of our Song Dynasty? Zongbao, I don't think the enemy is that simple. Father, I led the soldiers last night into the enemy's camps to rescue captured civilians. The Liao army is not a united enemy at all. They have so few people now. There's nothing to be afraid of. Is that right, Tiger, Iron Ox? Yes. Soldiers, Charge with me. Go. Zongbao, Something is wrong. Be on guard. Master. Can such a small mist wipe out the Song army? Your Majesty, you do not know yet. This is the Heavenly Gate Formation, one of the ancient ten strange formations. The secret behind it, Your Majesty will know it soon. Defense formation. This is an illusion. An illusion. Tiger. Tiger. Tiger. General. General. General. Defense formation. This time the Liao army is well prepared. We fight and retreat. Guys, this is the door. Go, General. Quickly. Iron Ox. Iron Ox. Iron Ox. Iron Ox. Carry Zongbao. Retreat. Whoever violates my order will die. Iron Ox. Go, General. Father, It was my fault to underestimate the enemy, which caused our army so much loss in this battle. Father, please punish me. Marshal, This was not General's fault. The Liao army was well prepared. This was the evil Heavenly Gate Formation. The mist in the formation was poisonous. It could blind the eyes. The poisoned victims would have visions They could not distinguish the enemy from us. It's hard to break the formation. This battle cost too much. Get up. Perhaps I have a strategy which can break the Liao army's evil formation. Father, please tell. That year I and Mu Yu, the chief of Muke Fortress went to war together. Mu Yu once said he had an ancestral dragon-subduing wood which could avoid all evil obstacles. If we get this wood, maybe there is still a chance what we can break the formation. Father, please give me a chance to share this burden with you and contribute my force to Song Dynasty. Friends and neighbors, how are you? Fine. Today, This tournament is for my daughter, Mu Guiying, To find a good husband. To find a good husband. If you are a hero who can defeat Mu Guiying, you will become the son-in-law of Muke Fortress. The hero. Hero. No. Come on. I have to go to the toilet because I have a stomachache. Don't run! Don't run! Look at my little girl's heroic posture. Turn around. Oh, this is the third tournament this month. The third tournament this month. I will try. This hero. Welcome. Good. Stop. Go. You stinking men All of you are useless. I will try. Girl, your statement is too absolute. May I ask you... This young man is so handsome. Oh. What do you think? Is he qualified to be our young lady's husband? No one is good enough for our young lady. I lost. Girl, you didn't care about winning or losing. You saved me first. Regarding the martial arts and the virtues, you are better than me. I lost. Oh. It was my daughter who lost. Wow! Wow ha ha ha ha. Wow! Good fellow. Just like me when I was young. You're gonna be my son-in-law. Ah. I'm not here for marriage. I'm here to see Chief Mu. Oh. I am Chief Mu. What's the matter? My good son-in-law. Chief Mu, I am Yang Zongbao from Song Dynasty. The Liao army deployed the evil Heavenly Gate Formation. Our soldiers suffered heavy casualties. I am here to borrow from Chief Mu the dragon-subduing wood to break the formation of the enemy. I will not borrow it to you. Dad. I was wronged by the Royal Court. My family was exiled here. Your mother wouldn't have died a premature death. You. If you bring it up again, I will throw you out of the Muke Fortress. Your Majesty. The third princess. Your Majesty, The main force of the Song army was defeated by my Heavenly Gate Formation. We killed them. But what a pity! A few of them was off the hook. Your Majesty, in this battle if we win, the Song army will no longer able to resist. Then we can go straight into their territory. From then on, the land will all be ours. Ha ha. Well done, Master. Yanshou, this Heavenly Gate Formation is pretty good. Mother, as far as I know, the Heavenly Gate Formation is more than just a maze. I think there's a killing formation in it. If my guess is correct, I think there's hallucinogenic poison in that smoke. As for the rest, I don't know. Princess Yelv Yanshou is smart indeed. Right. The Heavenly Gate Formation is made up of multiple formations. The smoke contains the poison of datura which can make people hallucinate and even kill each other. And on the outside is a trap. Once you get into it, you get lost. The eight shadow doors form a magic killing formation. Reality and Illusion change into one another. Our army will win without a fight. It is really marvelous. The reward will be sent to your tent. I hope Master will continue to work for our Liao army. Thank you, Your Majesty. Step down. Yes. Yanshou, what do you think? Mother, as far as I can tell, the Heavenly Gate Formation may seem wonderful, but it is not invulnerable As long as the poison of the datura is countered, it will be broken. There are many things in the world that can counter poison. That's what I'm worried about. I've studied the culture of the Southern Dynasties from my childhood. In my travels I got to know an amazing woman who specializes in the poison of the datura. She has ways to improve the formation. And this woman has an important identity. Oh? She and the Yang family were sworn enemies. My lady. Control yourself. My lady, your future husband is so good-looking. What future husband? My lady is not married yet. He is just an outsider now. All right, all right. Dismissed. Miss Mu. I have no history with you. Why are you scheming against me? Don't say that. The rules of the tournament were clear. You were in the ring and you defeated me. Of course you will marry me. There is no scheming. You know I didn't ask for it. Then I Will fight you again If I defeat you, you will be my man. I let you win in the ring. You really think I couldn't defeat you? You're so good at martial arts. If you serve in the army, You are bound to make a difference. It's a pity that you need to stay here in Muke Fortress and grow old with me. Forget about the army, all right? Just stay where you are. Well. Keep an eye on him. Yes. Yes. Your Majesty. What a beautiful girl! What's your name? Qiao Yuqin. Yanshou said you and the Yang family were sworn enemies. Why? I don't want to mention it. Mother, Yuqin may have a history of hatred which is hard to talk about. You have a personality. I like it. When it is finished, what kind of reward do you want? Killing Yang Yanzhao. Your Majesty. This is Qiao Yuqin. She specializes in the poison of the datura. She's going to help you improve the Heavenly Gate Formation. Hmm. I have a good command of the poison of the datura for years. Not to mention the Heavenly Gate Formation is already unassailable. So it does not need any improvement. Master, you're being too confident. The battlefield is full of changes. Can you handle it when things go wrong? The princess is right. But I still do not know how she can help us. Doesn't Master feel hot? Your Majesty, please pardon me. How do you feel now, Master? Hot. Oh, no. I am such a fool. I hope you can enlighten me. Have you ever heard of it, Master? Black datura is a weapon left behind by the ancestors of our Mu family. The ancestor of the Mu clan all died fighting against the Liao invasion. All the weapons we can find are here. The Mu family's sense of honor is admirable. All right. I'll leave you to it. Remember to close the windows. There's a trail over there. When I was a child, my lady and I used to sneak out of the fortress. It's been abandoned for a long time. I'm afraid it's not very safe. Mr. Yang, you must remember to close the windows. Dad. Are you really cruel enough to ignore the world? Oh, what do I have to do with the world? But you taught me since I was a kid. "The family of the nation is big. The family of the people is small. If there is no big family, how can there be the small family?" I know which one is more important. I can tell the difference. I know that. But... But, about your mother, I just can't let it go. Guiying, what do you think of Yang Zongbao? Courageous. Responsible. Good at Martial arts. So you like him? Huh? Hey. There is a thief. Go and see. Catch the thief. You brat, you're a stealthy thief. Guys, Yes. Take him out and kill him. Yes. Stop. Dad. Hmm. Dad. GuiYing! Don't you know our family rule? Anyone who comes to our Mu house to steal the dragon-subduing wood will be killed without pardon. Dad, Mr. Yang doesn't know. He who does not know is innocent. There is no need to persuade him. Thank you, Miss Mu, for your help. I, Yang Zongbao, take the responsibility. Kill me if you want. If I frown, I will not be a part of the Yang family. It's a pity I'm dead for nothing. A man like me should serve the country and die on the battlefield He is so wordy before his death. Take him out. Who dares to move? Dad, Zongbao is not an outsider. He is my future husband. So he didn't steal it He, He just took it. What future husband? Since he won the tournament, he is my future husband. This is also the rule set before. Right. Master, Mr. Yang, he won the tournament. Of course he's your son-in-law. Well said. Did he promise? Confronted with a formidable enemy, Zongbao really has no intention of getting married. Thank you for your love. Please forgive Zongbao for not obeying. Ah. You have no intention of getting married? How unkind of you! Guiying, this future husband that you want to protect is unwilling to take it. Let me ask you. Which part of her doesn't deserve you? No. It is not that she doesn't deserve me. Then what's wrong with her? No. There's nothing wrong with her. Then you don't like her? Not true. I don't dislike her. That means you like her? I, like her. Oh dear. That's good. Since you like her, send my order. Choose a day for the wedding. No, no. Chief Mu, marriage is a major event in life. Well, I mean let me tell my father. My father will come by himself to ask for your permission to let your daughter marry me. That's OK. Since you're willing to get married, we will be a family in the future. As for the dragon-subduing wood, don't mention it again. I will forget about it. It is decided. Let's go. What do you have for dinner? Steamed fish head with diced hot red peppers. More peppers for dinner. Come in. Chief Mu, you asked to see me? Sit. This wine was buried by me when Guiying was born. I buried it under the big tree in front of the fortress. Now I took it out. It smells good. Would you like to try? I'm sorry. It is inconvenient to drink when the war is imminent. Don't take it personally about today's incident. I dare not. I broke the rules. I can't blame you Guiying's mother died early. I took her with me since her childhood. I raised Guiying like a boy. I let her practice martial arts with the boys in the village When practicing, all the boys fell She held on. As a result, she was too tired to get up for three days. I was in the army for half my life, going through fire and water, fearing nothing and no one. I only get afraid when she calls me Dad. Now I'm afraid she will be alone in the future. How can she fight against the iron cavalry of the Liao army? I entrust her to you. I hope you can take good care of her. Chief Mu, Zongbao assures you if someone dares to hurt Miss mu he needs to step over my body. Good. I'm relieved by your words. Tomorrow morning, You take the dragon-subduing wood with you. Thank you, Chief Mu. Miss Mu. This is... Open it. The dragon-subduing wood. My father asked me to give it to you. Don't worry. Miss Mu. Please thank Chief Mu for me. Don't you thank me? Oh. Thank you, Miss Mu. When are you leaving? Now. Ok. Then off you go. Miss Mu. When I am back home, I will let my father come to Muke Fortress by himself and ask your father for permission for marriage. All right, go. Go. Dad, he's gone. Hate to part with him? No. No. Don't lie to me. I'm your father. In fact, you can't force it. Give to get. Wherever your heart is, you'll go back sooner or later. Dad, where's your heart? Master, what's the plan? The auspicious time has arrived. Why are you fighting? Still fighting? Stop. Stop fighting. Dad, are you ok? Don't worry. Go. Stop. Go. Miss Mu. Miss Mu. What's going on? A strange mist suddenly appeared in the fortress. The villagers went crazy and fought each other. The smoke caused hallucination. Knock them out. Chief Mu, are you ok? I'm fine. I still have a healthy body. Marshal, The Liao army seems to be assembling. There is a tendency to attack. How are our forces now? The military power was seriously damaged in the last battle. Most of the wounded have not recovered yet. The enemy is assisted by the Heavenly Gate Formation. I'm afraid... Have you heard from Yang Zongbao? No. Prepare a horse for me. I'm going to Muke Fortress. The situation is dangerous. It's better to be careful. Go. Go. Chief Mu. Father. Everyone settled down and went back to rest. After counting, twenty-three people were injured. Death? Eight. Good. Long time no see. Long time no see. So you're still working for the Royal Court? After all those years of war, you are still so young. Mu, stop making fun of me. You see. Your style now is no less than in the past. I don't know when you can go back to war with me? Don't mention the past. I, Mu Yu, will never go to war for that emperor. Father, The fortress was suddenly filled with smoke. Then the villagers became crazy. I think the smoke was no different from what we saw when we fought the Liao army. It should be the Liao army that did this. The Liao army. Our Muke Fortress is behind the Song army. Why did they cross the camps and attack our Muke Fortress? I'm sorry. This was probably because of me. Father, I have a request. I want to take our Mu's people to the battlefield and kill the Liao army to avenge our villagers. Guiying, so many things have happened in our village. As the leader of the stronghold, how can you leave? Chief Mu, it all started because of me. I will give the Mu family an explanation. Yang Zongbao, take the dragon-subduing wood. This time, I, Yang Zongbao, implicated Muke Fortress. Thank you, Miss Mu, for your understanding. With the help of the dragon-subduing wood, I will kill the Liao army myself and give Muke stronghold an explanation. Got it. Miss Mu, I, Yang Zongbao, am not a perfidious person. If this battle is won, I will come back to the village and marry you. Be careful. Miss Mu, You are good at martial arts and you are from a martial family. Why not fight with me? General Yang, take care. Sorry for not walking you out. Come in. Tonight, I only belong to you. Little girl, let me kiss you. How naughty! Are you a special general of the Yang's army? I am. What is the password for the Yang's camps? The password... The password is... Long time no see, Marshal Yang. You are still so dignified and impressive. You probably never thought that your own life will fall into the hands of an unarmed little girl of that year. If you are used to cultivate datura, it must be beautiful. I didn't realize you were pretending. Insignificant skill. Who are you? Marshal Yang, you have a bad memory. When you cut off the heads of my family, you were not like this. So you are the daughter of the Qiao family? You Qiao family framed someone loyal and kind. Your family's crime deserved death. The emperor ordered me to kill all of you. I spared you because you were so young. I didn't expect you to... Marshal, there is a spy in the army. Change the password now. Strengthen the guard. Yes, sir. That year when General Mu Yu and I fought on the battlefield, Mu Yu once told me the dragon-subduing wood can break all evil barriers. It seems that this statement is true. We have the dragon-subduing wood in hand. Breaking the Liao army's evil formation is possible. Father, I request to go to war, avenging the dead people of Muke Fortress. Although we have dragon-subduing wood, the enemy is cunning. Don't take it lightly. Yes. Send the order. Recuperate and build up strength. Two days later, attack the enemy and break the formation. Yes, sir. Yang Zongbao, listen to the order. Yes, sir. Protect the dragon-subduing wood in case of a sneak attack by the enemy. There must be no accident. Zongbao is here to make a military pledge: I will live when this wood is intact. I will die when this wood is broken. Master. I did not know Your Majesty came. Please forgive me. Two days later, the army will launch a general offensive. I'm afraid my men are careless. So I came to inform Master in person. Thank you, Your Majesty. Qiao Yuqin just got the news. The Song army seems to have a dragon-subduing wood designed to break evil barriers. This will not affect Master's Heavenly Gate Formation, will it? A dragon-subduing wood? Looks like last time they escaped. Let me think about how to deal with this. I already have a plan. I wonder how Master is going to thank me. General, Marshal asked you to attend the meeting. I just came back from my father's. What happened? It is said that it has something to do with Miss mu. I'll be right there. After we have this magical wood, we will certainly make the Liao army retreat to Yanmen Pass. Then... Oh dear, I can see my wife. Look at you. What? Don't you miss home? I'm a little homesick, too. When we win the war and go home, I will buy an ox and do some farming at home. A red one. No. No. A yellow one is better. A red one. Oh dear. Red cattle have more strength. Red. Why is the sky turning red over there? It's on fire. Isn't that General's camp? It's on fire. Put out the fire! It's on fire. Put out the fire! Miss Qiao is so clever. I really admired your plan. If the Liao army wins this time, Miss Qiao's credit must be second to none I don't want any credit. I just want to kill Yang Yanzhao. I need your help in this matter, Master. Miss Qiao, if you need any help, I will definitely go to all lengths. I have a big gift. Master Wang's Heavenly Gate Formation must need it. Yang Zongbao, What crime did you commit? Dereliction of duty. I am willing to be punished. You were here the day before yesterday to make a military pledge: You will live when this wood is intact. You will die when this wood is broken. Now the dragon-subduing wood has been destroyed. I'll deal with you by military law Marshal, General's crime does not deserve death. Marshal, General has made great contribution to the army. Give him another chance. If the emperor breaks the law, he will also be punished. Although Yang Zongbao is my son, there is no exception. Tomorrow afternoon at 3:45, he will be beheaded. Drag him out. Yes, sir. Guard. Yes. Notice that Yang Zongbao will be beheaded tomorrow. Put the notice on the entrance of Muke Fortress to inform and comfort people. Yes, sir. Dad. What do you think of the repairment? It's all fixed Better than before. Yeah. They repaired it very carefully this time. My lady. My lady. My lady, it's bad. Yueyue, what's the matter? Yang Zongbao is going to be executed He didn't protect the wood well. Marshal Yang ordered him to be beheaded tomorrow. Go. Prepare the horse. Stop. What are you doing? Dad! Zongbao is in trouble. I must help him. Why do you care if Yang Yanzhao kills his son? Dad. Hmm. Dad. Go. Go ahead. Go. Let's count national enmity and family hatred together. Stop. It's dangerous You don't have to go with me We are your people. Even when we die, we will be your ghosts. We have been by your side for more than ten years. We'll go wherever our lady goes. How boring it is to stay in the village! We just want to be heroes with our lady. Go. Generals, the Liao army is invading our great Song Dynasty. They set up the Heavenly Gate Formation at Yanmen Pass. Only the dragon-subduing wood can break it. The day before yesterday, General Yang Zongbao Made a military pledge to protect the wood. He will live when this wood is intact. He will die when this wood is broken. Today, Yang Zongbao failed to protect the wood so that the dragon-subduing wood was destroyed. According to military law, he should be beheaded. The time has come. Behead immediately to show military prestige. Behead. Who dares to disturb the execution ground? Take the person. Stop it. Mu Guiying from Muke Fortress earnestly requests Marshal Yang to spare him. Miss Mu, do you know Yang Zongbao failed to protect the dragon-subduing wood? As a result, our Song Dynasty lost the key to break the Heavenly Gate Formation. According to military law, he must be beheaded. Marshal, don't forget this dragon-subduing wood is the treasure of our Mu family. So what? Yang Zongbao made a military pledge that day. He will live when this wood is intact. He will die when this wood is broken. Now the dragon-subduing wood has been destroyed. According to the military law, if he is not properly executed, how should we convince the public? You want this dragon-subduing wood just to break the formation. Then I'll help you break the Heavenly Gate Formation. Ok? I beg Marshal to let General redeem himself by good service. Are you serious, Miss Mu? Of course. Ok. If Miss Mu can break the Heavenly Gate Formation, I'll leave Yang Zongbao alive for the time being. When he makes contributions, We will discuss how to deal with him. You are so confident. Is there really a way to break the formation? No. No? Did you come to die? It's just fighting. Why make such a fuss? Your Majesty. There will be a war tomorrow. I still have trouble sleeping and eating. Tomorrow's expedition is ready. Please rest assured, Your Majesty. Thank you, Master. Be sure to trap the Song army in the formation. Things outside the formation are arranged by me. Success or failure depends on it. I hope you can do your best, Master. Please rest assured, Your Majesty. Please look. Here is the Liao army's formation. The Heavenly Gate Formation is weird and multi-faceted. Mu Guiying, do you have the best plan? I have sent people to inquire inside the Liao army. The food reserve of the Liao army is very low now. If they lose tomorrow's war, the Liao army will have to move back to the city. except the Heavenly Gate Formation, There's nothing else to rely on for the Liao army. And the key to the Heavenly Gate Formation is giving out yellow smoke of poisonous datura before the formation of the formation. which can make the poisoned person hallucinate and cut kill each other. If you can break the yellow smoke, the Heavenly Gate Formation is nothing to be scared of. I have ground the burned dragon-subduing wood into carbon dust and wrapped it in scarves to cover your noses. They can protect soldiers from poisons. Meanwhile, I also made sixteen heavy arrows to break the formation. These will be used to break the door of the formation and then cooperate with the flag formation to mess up their formation. Finally, I will enter the core zone to destroy the eye of the formation. This is the dragon-subduing spear. This dragon-subduing spear is made of dragon-subduing wood. This is the real heirloom of our Mu family. All the generals, listen to the order. In the Battle of Yanmen Pass, Mu Guiying will take my place as the Marshal. Officers and soldiers, will listen to her orders. Why let a woman command? Yeah. Can this skinny little one do it? I don't think so. Anyone who refuses to obey, come forward to challenge her. I'll do it. Who else? General Mu goes to war. This battle is sure to win. General Mu goes to war. This battle is sure to win. General Mu goes to war. This battle is sure to win. General Mu goes to war. This battle is sure to win. I didn't expect the dragon-subduing wood to be used like this. It's because of you. Marshal Yang, Zongbao and I and others all have the dragon-subduing wood with us. We will definitely break the formation in this battle. I'm afraid the Liao army will make a circuitous raid from behind. Don't worry. I will hold on until you break the formation and fight back. Go to war. Marshal Yang, please guard the rear. The soldiers ahead, listen to my orders. The leading army, attack. Go. Dismount. Cover your noses. Come into the formation with me. Send my order. The whole army, be on alert. In case the enemy sneak from behind. The number of our soldiers staying behind are limited. We can only outwit, not attack hard. Set mine. Pit and well. Thistles and thorns. The formation of rope, spear and shield. The whole army. High alert. Report. Master, The enemy have scarves to cover their noses. They seem unaffected by the poison. It does not matter. Send people into the formation. Let them breathe well. Yes. Can't my Heavenly Gate Formation be strengthened? Marshal, the poisonous mist is getting stronger. The soldiers have shown signs of being poisoned. All the people. Take off the head of the spear. Turn attack into defense. Report. Marshal, the right wing found an enemy raid. Get ready to fight. Marshal Yang, long time no see. You have repeatedly violated the border of the great Song Dynasty. The two armies fought so frequently. I don't think it has been a long time. I am sincere. The Yanmen Pass has been as solid as gold so far. Marshal Yang has made great contributions. We are short of such good generals in our Liao army. The emperor of Song values literature over martial arts. You might as well surrender to me. You will be the Grand Marshal of the great Liao Dynasty. How do you like it? You are delusional. Kill. Fight. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. The flag formation. Break up the smoke. Five Elements and Eight Diagrams generate and counter each other. Rest, Life, Wound, Block. Five Elements and Eight Diagrams generate and counter each other. Rest, Life, Wound, Block. Scenery, Death, Horror, Open. The door of Life is next to the door of Scenery. This formation will be chaotic. Wind, Flower, Snow, Moon. Send me up. The door of Life in the southeast breaks the eight doors. Discharge. Miss Mu. Kill. Kill. Flower. Miss Mu Yue, From the moment you were trapped in the Heavenly Gate Formation by me, the defeat of the Song Dynasty has been decided. Ah. Come on. Kill. Rescue. If I frown, I'm not from the Yang family. A few more people asking for death. Take some trouble. Kill. Who dares to hurt my in-law? Dad. Go. Old fool. You still like to show off. I just came out to stretch my limbs. Move out of my way. Oh dear. Your reflex is still so slow. Brother, I knew you would come. Poisonous. Call the army doctor. Old Mu. Dad. Dad. Old Mu. Chief Mu. Dad. Old Mu. Dad. Don't cry. You look ugly. I am not crying. I did not expect as an old man, I would eventually contribute myself to the Royal Court. Shame. National enmity and family hatred. I know which one is more important. I can tell the difference. Dad. Veteran Mu Yu is back. I am back. Dad. I am back. Dad. Old Mu. Chief Mu. Dad. General Mu. Chief Mu. Mu Guiying. Move out of my way. Mu Guiying, Have you ever thought about it? You are now the commander of the three military forces. If you do this, The war between the great Song Dynasty and the Liao will never cease. How many people will be homeless and miserable? How many soldiers will die on the battlefield? How many people will be like you, losing their father and children? Kill or not, you decide. It's up to you. Do it. Swear it. In your lifetime, you will never invade our Song Dynasty. Ok. Dad.
