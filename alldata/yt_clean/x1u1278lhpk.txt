Lamb Shekarbura, the iconic food of the Novruz holiday in Azerbaijan. Walnuts We are welcoming the ambassador of the US in Azerbaijan, Mr. Mark Libby, for the celebration of our national holiday Novruz. ..thank you so much for having me. Please, meet my wife. Thank you very much! We are very pleased to be here (in Azerbaijani). - Very beautiful scenery. Your spot is perfect (in Azerbaijani) Kechel and Kosa, the symbolic characters of Novruz. Azerbaijani traditional hats, 'Papaq' and 'Kelaghayi', were presented as holiday gifts to Mr. and Mrs. Libby. One of the traditions of our Novruz holiday is the egg-tapping game. - One, two, three. - I won! - The victor! The victor goes to the spoils. - Pakhlava, shekarbura, goghal. Thank you very much! Great. Samani, the symbol of spring and fertility, prosperity and prosperity. Smell it. It is spring (in Azerbaijani). Thank you. Traditional rug weaving and knitting. How long does it take to make like this one? How long does that take? - Three to four days. The ornaments on each of these socks have their own meanings. Usually, we put ornaments that belong to our village. Pomegranate blossoms for instance. I am very impressed. Thank you so much. The color red was used most of all because it also meant their productivity and their wealthiness.. ..and then they added different colors to symbolize the seasons of the year. - This is what we call 'nehra'. This is to get butter. That, yes. What you do? You shake it constantly for a long time.. ..to get cream out of the milk. And then it comes out like a butter. So, it is symbolic and that remains still. It is very thin. Very, very thin. There are different types of Gutabs in Azerbaijan. This one that they are preparing is very peculiar to this Gabala village (Gamarvan) which is mostly populated by Lezgins. - Oh, okay. Bigger than the ones that you would see in Baku and its filling is more. They have more fillings in them. This is great. This is our national food, "Shah Plov". Kind of meal that Shahs would prefer to eat. That meal needs a bit more oil, the rice likes the oil that is why we use more. - To the corners. This meal is cooked and covered with lavashes. - That is what they making before. - This is the butter they were making over there? - And the name of this is? - Could you help me, please? Just right up here like this? Sure, all good. - To this side as well. - Good. - You are very talented. You gave me the easiest part (in Azerbaijani). &quot;Uchgulag&quot; (three ears) is a unique and traditional sweet that is specific to the Gabala region. Rice Dried fruits and lamb -Teamwork! - I told him it is teamwork. A bit more oil. - Are we ready? (in Azerbaijani) Very nice. - This looks like Dolma (in Azerbaijani). Shekarbura is a sweet pastry in a half-moon shape, filled with ground almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, and sugar. It also has a symbolic meaning which denotes the half-moon or flame of fire. - This is the last layer (in Azerbaijani). Very good. Alright! Here we go! We are very famous for our good jams. You are welcome to taste it. - This is olives or? - Walnuts. - It is very peculiar to this region. Yes, because we are well equipped and the Gabala is popular with its nuts. Wow! I would never have guessed this is walnut. So, one walnut 3 hours (in Azerbaijani). And it is here. It is early stage. When it is still green Oh, so it is early? Okay. They take them off. That means they are young (in Azerbaijani)? It is young. They are new. Gutabs are here. Wow. So, it is cheese. There is cheese (in Azerbaijani). There is. It is the main ingredient that makes it tasty. How does Sumakh grow? Is this the leaf of it? Or the stem of it? What is this? These are the small fruits but wild ones. They gather them but it should be on time. - Oh, it is fruit? - Go? Shall we? National Dance of Azerbaijan - Super. Okay, good. Thank you. This is also one of our national foods, Dolma. Dolma is prepared like this. I prepared two types. One is without meat, with walnuts. This one is with meat. The one that we like. Did you get these leaves here? (in Azerbaijani) Yes, they have been salted especially for Dolma. - Oh, okay. But are they from here? - Done. - It looks easy (in Azerbaijani) - So we try it? - I prepared it for you. Put some meat. Alright. So, we do like this. Then on the side.. ..and then close it up? Look at that. - That works? (in Azerbaijani) Your turn. Very beautiful. Super. Very tidy. I am not the guy who gets a Super? Super! Let us leave those to cook. Then we will taste them. This one is for the ones who do not eat meat. Vegetarian option. And it just cooks so that the ambient heat is in there. How many times a week do you burn your hands on the stove? I am already used to it. My hands do not get burned. You got to be tough, yeah. Excellent. It will burn. It will explode (in Azerbaijani). Children jump over the fire. After the winter, they leave all the aches and unfortunates on the fire and get fresh. Now, I will cook a meal that is peculiar to our village. It is called 'Dasharasi' (between the stones). We will use lamb. - Say it again in Azerbaijani. 'Dasharasi', okay. First of all, we need to grease the top of the stone, for a better cooking experience. Add some salt. You may add some pepper as well, for their taste. I abdicated my responsibility in the salt part. So, they decide if it should be salty or not - This is your responsibility now. How long does it take to heat up? Now we are going to prepare the meat while the fat gets melted. Is this your own lamb? I love having my own. So, yes, I have other animals. We can put these now on the stone. We also put some vegetables there. - It smells really good. - We also have an empty place here. This will make it softer. It is noisy (in Azerbaijani). Since we put it on it, it makes a noise. Amazing. So we let it sit now? Yes, we wait for some time. After one side is done, we flip them. Potatoes cooked in the fat oil also taste very good. We have a spot here. And here. - And there. - We find it perfectly. - You have an eye. You could see it perfectly. - He is chopping very professionally, for real. - You want to try one? I think this one needs to go and this one may be. - Yeah, okay. Looks good. I love that. It is a nice sound. Sound of victory. We need to check it. It smells so good. Okay, that is it. My husband got the best training. So, he will be the main chef in the family. - Alright, ready? Just grab one. Wow. Super. It is super. See? I am not lying about it when I say 'Super!'. You tasted it yourself. This is the best breakfast I have had the whole year. - You are hungry. This is really nice. This is really good. Perfect. Oh, great. Really good. Nice little salt. The flavor of the meat. It is really nice. They put the salt themselves. It is really nice. It is amazing how it blends together. Really nice flavor. Bravo! Azerbaijani Folk Dance, 'Yalli'. 'Aghirlighim, ughurlughum', meaning all my aches and unfortunate burn on the fire. We need to do it three times. 'Aghirlighim, ughurlughum.' Bravo. It is boiling. Here you go. - Oh yeah. This one with meat. This is the one I need. - That is the last one, right? It is juicy. I have a big one. Oh my god. Wow, it is amazing. I am very glad that you liked it. - So are we. As we say in Polish, "Niebo w gebie!" (Like little drops of heaven). - Oh, look at that. - He wants to taste it (in Azerbaijani). Wow, it is so crispy. Again, like a pie. - Left-handed. It is good. Thank you. - Super! May god praise health to your hands. You did very well. Very tasty, Wow, show time. - What is the word you use for that? 'Papag atdi' (hats throwing), a Novruz tradition. This is one of the traditions. It is small kids and neighbors. Oh, three hats? During Novruz, as a traditional game, kids throw their hats in front of the doos, knock on the doors and hide. They wait until the owners of the house take the hats and fill them with food such as holiday sweets, nuts, eggs, etc. Alright, I love it. I want to make sure that we get the variety. I hope they will distribute it among their friends as well. Later on, the family leaves the hats in front of the door and closes the door. As if they have no idea about it. Checking their reactions. It is just one piece of wood. It is one piece of wood? Yes, from the same wood. I have cut it and put them in this way. The name of this bird is the 'Happiness bird'. I wish you happiness in your career and family. This is one of my favorite handmade crafts. Even though I am good at cooking, I also love crafting. It is really nice. Thank you so much. It is a bowl made out of wood. I have crafted it myself. Looks like it is from a single piece of wood. - This is amazing. - I did want to bring you a small token of our appreciation. It is not from my own hand because you would not want such a gift. But it is from my heart. So, thank you so much. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it will give you some sense of.. It will give you some sense of the part of the country where I am from. This book is called the Maine Woods. Maine is a state in the Northeast, where my family and my ancestors came from. I liked it. Nature is so close to me. I think you may find that it is resembling in some cases. So, I hope that makes you comfortable and at home when you look at.. ..these pictures because it certainly reminds me of this place. - Very beautiful. Thank you. And this is just a small thing.
