We're gonna check out the back roads, see what it's like out there. We should be on the road until it gets dark, to Let's do this. (gentle guitar music) (gentle guitar music continues) Alright guys, we are out there now, smack in the middle of the state, in the southern part. That quick snippet of a drive you just saw took around an hour and Look at this place. How cool is that? Part wood, part stone. And I think we're in Mennonite country. See the woman with the head covering. (door squeaking) Things going on in the community. Mullet for everyone. Deli menu. Get a full hoagie for $7.50. Breakfast sandwich, $2.75. Thank you all, very friendly. Okay, so people at the register just gave me good advice - Yeah, you have a good trip. Oh, there was such a good shot in there. Unfortunately, this Amish lady so I had to turn it off. And parts of the country like this, the, I'd say lesser known How you doing, sir? - Talk to me. About what? - [Peter] What's it like out here? - Jesus is Lord of my life. - [Peter] Did you just find him or have you've always had him? - I've always had him. - Yes. if they don't have him? - Yes they are. - He's the one that made the world and he's the one that makes and we rejoice in - [Peter] Okay, pretty - I don't look at it as religious. - [Peter] What do you look at it as? - Relational. - Relationship with Jesus Christ. - Okay, do you go to church every Sunday? - I do. But can you have the relationship - Well, it is possible, it helps your relationship with others. - Yeah. in your Christian role. - [Peter] Good community out here? - Actually, I'm not from around here. - [Peter] Where are you from? - I'm from Lancaster County. What county is this? - This is Franklin County. - Okay. - Thank you sir. So yeah, that's how it is in where I don't think they get but they're pretty pumped to talk to you and excited about sharing (traffic humming) (birds chirping) (wind rustling) Look at that cute old couple. I'm starting to feel that from around Amish country, the pace slows down. Very calming. Baked goods here, we got some bread and what the Amish What a cool place you got. - Is it okay if I record it? - [Peter] Thank you. Is it Mennonite or Amish? - It's run by Amish, but there's both types of - Okay, what do you suggest? - My favorite is the oatmeal whoopie pies, but you could get one of these fried pies. - [Peter] Oh, I don't Okay. What about the peanut butter? That looks good. - It's good. I'll do one of those. - [Peter] Are you Amish or Mennonite? - Mennonite. Do you love living out here? - Yeah, I do. I was actually born in China and then I was adopted when I was four. So I came over here when I was four. - Wow, that's interesting. - [Peter] You don't know - No. (Peter speaking Chinese). - Yeah, I lost it over the years, but I'm trying to relearn it. - [Peter] Oh, really? - I just started recently - [Peter] Okay, well thank you so much. - You're welcome. - [Peter] Take care. Have a good day. (door squeaking) (insects chirping) Everything just slows down. It's the type of place you and there's nobody behind you and you can sink your Peanut butter cookie whoopie pie. Mm. If you eat one of these, that's like gateway to type two diabetes. But I'm gonna do half Super soft. It's just chill. (gentle guitar music) (gentle guitar music continues) Cucumbers, tomatoes. No Sunday sales. How you doing? Where do you guys have the (person speaking indistinctly) - It's right here. Look at this operation. It is massive. Don't record you, just the tomatoes. - No. I'll take a few of these. - [Clerk] You just place - Right on the scale. Okay. You speak in Pennsylvania Dutch at home? - [Clerk] Right, that's didn't understand you. - [Peter] 'Cause I was speaking English. - [Clerk] Right, they learn it when they go to school. - [Peter] So they don't speak English yet? - No. - [Clerk] Not this age. That's my nephew. - He's your nephew. - [Peter] You have - We do. - How many do you think? We haven't sold any of them yet. - This is the sheltie? - [Peter] And you got - That's my sister's.

Nice? - Alright, you take care. - Yeah. You too. What an interesting scene at that house. I couldn't record it, but ton of cute kids and a massive house. They're pretty much removed and the United States to some degree. From the time I've had with Amish, the most conservative, the Swartzentruber, maybe they were But they didn't even know This was in Holmes County, And they just stick in the religion. They stick in their family and to the land and really live in a different universe and what's funny about that quite often when people they'd say, &quot;Oh, they're And then during and after the pandemic of the videos I've posted, in the comments, so many people are like, &quot;Oh wow, they got it figured out. &quot;They got community. &quot;They're removed from so much of the noise &quot;and the social media and just stick close to their families.&quot; Sort of funny how that changed. Now with that said, the Amish and there's all sorts of just like whatever group and so it's easy to label or all Hasidic Jews are that. I don't hear an all wasp claim so much, but every group has darkness and lightness and I've seen both sides I've seen beauty and really and I've also seen some So it depends who and the one thing I've of video making is You never know what's really going on. (birds chirping) (gravel crunching) Here, we have an old church here. Fairview Church. &quot;The town's population was much larger in the 19th century than it is today. Many of the 2,000 residents engaged in farming, tanning, milling, timbering and other industries. The church was used from 1857 until just after World War II, when the dwindling population to move its services to other locations.&quot; I think that's the story for Once bustling with timber. I don't think coal was here, but we do have those hillsides, so I'm sure it was. And then those industries dried up, went away to some degree, and so do little towns like this. Sarah J, wife of M.H. Sheerer, So some of the people perhaps in that house, I'm sure these are some What do we got here? This little one. Yeah. That's just worn away. What's up you guys? Are you from Blaine? - I live in Mechanicsburg. - [Peter] It's a cool part of PA. Yeah? - Some interesting little towns out here. - What should I hit? What's an interesting town? - Oh man. - [Peter] West Chester? - Yeah, West Chester. Duncannon? - Yeah, so we were - How was that? We kinda go around and hit - What are you guys doing? door to door for Renewal by Andersen. We set people up for a and a free quote for replacement. - Lotta rejection? - [Peter] It builds a - Absolutely. in life after doing this sorta stuff. - Not at all. (laughs) - [Peter] It's like being - Yeah. Sometimes in some more country areas you'll run into some more abrasive people, but sometimes they're the friend- - Any shotguns? - Oh yeah, yeah. Getting escorted down a driveway by people with shotguns or you know, &quot;You're lucky You know, so it's- - [Peter] You got any pro tips, guys? When you're looking what do you say? - Smile at 'em. Kill 'em with kindness. - Deescalate. - [Peter] You have a future customer here coming on behind me. Mennonites and Amish are hard sets. I've set a few of 'em. - You have? - [Peter] Okay. I thought - No, there's ways around. You gotta get creative. Tell you in the winter, my, my patented wood stove (both laugh) That is funny. - [Peter] You just talk wood stoves. - You know, they'd tell me so they're not too worried about thermal efficiency in the winter. And I'm like, hey, you know, of heating your home, issue all the heat leaving your chimney, it's coming from somewhere, right? So it's being filtered in from around your window, - [Peter] You dropped convective current? - Hell yeah. - I had to explain it to And then so while that central you'll notice the peripheral typically bedrooms and and more drafty than they should be. So, you know, aside from- at that point in time in the conversation. - Yeah, pretty much. And also, you know, fewer Keep your bedrooms toastier with a more thermally efficient product. - Oh man. - I want to buy windows from ya. - Pretty slick. Yeah. Well hey, see if there's in your area, man. Like I said, free inspection, free quote. - As in Andersen Windows? We're an offshoot. Alright man. These guys are great.

It was a shipping town. I - So back in the day, it was the world's At least the largest one in the US. - [Peter] Okay. - Over where McGuire's Ford was. - Okay. there was a flour mill, they had the sled works building, which was the lightning gliders. So they built sleds. There was a dress factory, the flour mill, the mill was so big that They built the highway and that's where the highway is. Another fun fact is the mill was continuously made out of wood and it burnt down at least twice. And they kept rebuilding it on wood. 'Cause they were surrounded So they just kept rebuilding - Oh that's cool. - [Peter] Okay, so the and now you're saying it's - Yes. Yep. That empty lot over there Her dad was a clock - [Peter] Okay. - And that building and she grew up there and she said there was so much So that couldn't have been too long ago. - [Peter] So similar rust - Yeah. it went away. So a lotta small shops. And now we really don't And you're starting to You have Goodies. I think they just celebrated - [Peter] And then you have this hotel. That's a beauty. And that's an icon on 'Cause Duncannon is one of two trail towns that the Appalachian Trail - [Peter] Oh, I didn't know that. - Yep. - [Peter] We're on the Appalachian Trail. - We are. It actually turns left This road is the trail. And then it goes out of town and will hook up onto that mountain. There's an overlook called Hawk So right now we're seeing a lotta hikers going northbound. And they are gonna cross the river and go continue up to Maine. - [Peter] Here it is, Maine to Georgia. Don't know how long it is. 2000, 3000 miles, something like that. But this is one of the stops. North Carolina, Virginia. Okay. All the way up. And Pennsylvania. - The hotel we're in of this site here. - [Peter] Yeah. - This structure burned down in 1903. Charles Dickens stayed there. Union veterans quartered there. After that was destroyed by fire. Anheuser-Busch, the Budweiser people, constructed this place in 1905. - Oh really? - [Peter] Oh, that's cool. - They had a chain of 38 This is one of only two You are welcome to.... - [Peter] This is cool. Beautiful architecture there. - [Guide] Walk up to the second floor. - [Peter] Second floor? Okay. (door squeaks) Let's check out the upstairs. This state is a treasure trove of history. And this is just one part. So much variation. So we have a former ballroom. Maybe these tables come I don't know if that's - This was actually a pretty good town. They had a lot of businesses, a lot of, at least a half a dozen mom Western Auto, Five and It was a thriving little town, but it kinda... over the years turns. - [Peter] Is it coming back a little bit? - Ah, limping. - A little, limping back maybe.

I honestly think there are people trying, trying to get it going. we need to make a little more business. - [Worker] How long have - [Peter] A little more what? - Business friendly. - [Worker] Hey boss, how long - They're trying, they're And I think they're - [Peter] Okay. What was this river known for back in the, was it a huge- - [Peter] Yeah, Susquehanna. - They used to run barges - Okay. But it's shallow. This is the largest - Really? how the old explorers did it. They must have people But it empties into Chesapeake Bay. (traffic humming) - Look at how cool the train And then I'm sure the train And the Susquehanna River, I believe that's how you pronounce it, carried the commerce Everyone worked in town, lived in town, spent their money in town. And now a lotta those jobs And I'm sure some are still here, but what I learned over near is the towns near the the people that work They live out in the countryside or a bit away where it's nicer these days. And so they're not staying there and spending their money there. (traffic humming) (traffic continues humming) Hello sir. - We do barbecue chicken. - Oh you do barbecue chicken. - Yeah. - [Clerk] We have wings, we - [Peter] I'll do a quarter. How much sir? - That's $4. Good deal. I'm doing a video of the whole area. - Okay. to show off the food of the region. - I see. - I guess. (laughs) - Yeah. - [Clerk] Take care. - Alright. Oh yeah, look at that. It's got a lot of marinade on it, Mm, mm. Right off the bone there. Super tender. $4 for all of this. So it's unbelievable. Mm. Yeah, over the years the and the Mennonites I've A lot of pride, a lot when it comes to furniture It seems like they're always (traffic humming) - A lotta my Amish buddies are firefighters and all that, like Gratz. Makes everything a lot easier, 'Cause you know, working they get a lotta that muscle - So you have Amish friends? - [Peter] You are gonna be a - I am currently a firefighter. - Oh, right on man. Our classroom was filled with Amish guys. - [Peter] So a lot of Amish - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, up towards places like Gratz, for example. - Okay. a lot of Amish people are firefighters. - [Peter] Are they getting off the farm or what are they doing? - Basically they're just doing it until they get married and all that. And they have to transform into, you know, an actual Amish person. 'Cause before they get married they're able to do whatever they want. A lot of them go vape and all that stuff. But once they get married they have to choose between the white people's life or the Amish life. - [Peter] Okay, when they are you no longer friends or you guys hang out together still? - Oh, we'll still hang I'll be probably with It seems like a lot of 'em are going for like English way, my way, you know? - You think so? - Around this area. 'Cause I was surprised the other day when I seen a couple of 'em driving too. I asked 'em about that and they're like, &quot;Yeah, I don't think the Amish - You like living here? - Why? but you see it all still. You got new people that come - Nice. pretty interesting. - [Peter] You see a lot of How do you think What's your take? - Right now? Well, I personally think that they're struggling a little bit. I've been 3/4 of the way around the world - In the military? I don't think the economy I think people are struggling more now. I see more homeless people. I see people that are struggling just to make ends meet each day. Just coming in here and that they need to get by for the day. They're hurting for money. And I can tell by the way that and stuff like that $6.48. - [Peter] Right. You can see it firsthand. 'Cause you're with the cash register. - Oh yeah. I see it every day. - Okay. So when did that start changing? - Well, I haven't really but other places that - Thank you. Other places that I've worked, I saw the money was different Now it's not as good. People are hurting in a way that they don't want to express it. But you can see by the way that they handle themselves and their money. It's not there anymore. I mean, they'll buy only what and that's it. Before they come in and they'd buy a $50 worth of stuff. You know? - [Peter] You've lived in how many states? - Approximately eight. So what's your take on PA? - I liked it so much I came back. I left for years and then I came back. I think the people, to be - Yeah, I agree. - Yeah, exactly. - I do run into- but I was like nah, I'm not gonna do that. - $52.89 - Well you got Mennonites They're pretty easy to get along with. - Right.

I think he said he did. It's so cute here. You know, everyone knows everyone. These port zones are like and it's just cool to see that real simple communal vibe here. Which there again, I'm sort of digging. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) Here we are guys, Centralia. The coal mine has been burning since 1962. 2,400 people used to live here. Now it's four.

Yeah. - And eventually someday or something that flammable, threw it down into the trash pit. Caught the trash pit on fire. Caught the whole mine on fire. And ever since then, - There's no way to put it out? - No. It's been burning for over 60 years. - [Peter] Okay, so did people leave town because the jobs left or because of this accident? People left because you when we go to the highway, there were collapses. Big sinkholes would open up that would collapse into the ground. - [Peter] Oh. - I think one of the main reasons they shut down the whole town is some kid fell in a sinkhole. And died in the fire. - There's sinkholes all over the place? - Yeah. So you gotta be careful for them. - Okay, well we have like Yeah, I can go grab my two and then we can go onto the highway. - What? - Automotive, yeah. - Oh yeah?
