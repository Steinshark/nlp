&lt;b&gt;It's Lesage's centenary. 100 years of embroidery.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hello, hello! Let's open the archive boxes. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mari-Line Ledon-Lion, a Lesage embroiderer who knew Francois Lesage well.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The embroiderers at Lesage, they know how to do everything. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hubert Barrere, the current artistic director at Lesage. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- How old were you in 1939? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jean-Francois Lesage is the heir.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My father said he couldn't draw, but he drew quite well. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I doodle, but you know what I mean. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We open five boxes of important archives with them and they explain everything to us. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Dancing embroideries.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Look at that! We're going out clubbing, aren't we? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hello, Professor Prigent here, we're at Lesage,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; in the middle of the craziest samples from the whole world. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;No way!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Shall we go?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;ello, we're at Lesage in the Lesage archives &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and we're going to do something we've never done before: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;normally to come here, you work at Lesage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or you're a great couturier from a great fashion house &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and you have access to 75,000 samples.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so we're doing 100 years of Maison Lesage by opening a few symbolic boxes, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;important boxes, a box from 1924, that's when the house was created, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;a box from 1939 because apparently the most embroidered summer of the 20th century, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;paradoxically, was 1939.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We'll open a box from the 1960s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; to see the 30 glorious years explode in the face of the fabrics. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We'll open a box from 1985 because that's really when Lesage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;made the first move with Chanel &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and when the collaboration between Karl Lagerfeld and Francois Lesage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;became completely mind-boggling. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And so we're going to see the very last things Lesage was able to do, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;some of the very last things. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Obviously, as there are 175,000 boxes, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we're only going to see a tiny part of Lesage, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but we're still going to get a real treat.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jean-Francois Lesage is Artistic Director of Lesage Interieur, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;one of Lesage's entities, which puts its expertise at the service of furnishing projects &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;created hand in hand with the Vastrakala workshop in India. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He works between 19M and India. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Where are we?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We're in the archives room &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;at Lesage at 19M and there are about 75,000 archives behind us. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mari-Line Ledon-Lion has been an embroiderer at Lesage since 2004. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After obtaining her gold embroidery diploma &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;from the Lycee Professionnel Gilles Jamain in Rochefort (Charente Maritime), &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;she also completed additional training in hat, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;flower, feather, hand and machine embroidery at the Lycee Professionnel Octave Feuillet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The lycee de la mode et des metiers d'art. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;When did you join Lesage?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I joined in 2005 after an internship in 2004. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- So I'm approaching 20 years with the company.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Do you often come to this room? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;ut of all the 75,000 samples behind me,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; there are maybe ten or 15,000 that have made a model, as we used to say, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the rest are trials.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That means that many of the samples you have &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in front of you are relatively never seen. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Probably, probably.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What is your role at Lesage? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm artistic director of Lesage. I have this great joy. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What year did you join Lesage? I joined Lesage in 2011. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1er December 2011. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;In rather peculiar circumstances, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;because it was the very day Francois Lesage died. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- We open the 1924 box. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1924, the stock market is in a tailspin. A buying frenzy. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The garconnes' dresses were soberly geometric, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so they had to shine in return. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reinforced concrete, wrought iron, elegance goes hand in hand with sobriety. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Chiffon dominates. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Slanting fluidity, harmony, subtlety of color, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;monochrome embroidery, sowing of tubes, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;sinuous vermicelli of silver microbeads. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So the 1924 box, it's a good example of the taste of the time. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's called the Roaring Twenties. It's crazy embroidery, isn't it?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's crazy embroidery, but not that crazy. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;They're crazy because they correspond to the years in question. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But the materials used are very small. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Their main purpose is to catch the light. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here, on these circles that are scattered like this, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;we see tiny tubes that no longer exist, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with a little pink edging and all that, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;is really there to catch the light and make women shine. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The beads are tiny, and they're all about shine. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The motifs are generally a bit abstract. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We're really working on three subjects in all, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on a sample like this, which is really amazing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Dancing embroideries.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The 20s, it's suppleness, fluidity. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And at the same time, what's quite impressive is that it's a weight. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's crazy because you can't really see it, but this one is quite heavy,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; so you can imagine that it's quite heavy on a dress. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But it makes for a nice fall. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Who is Lesage in 1924?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage in 1924 is my grandfather and grandmother, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Albert and Marie-Louise.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Marie-Louise Lesage is a worldwide embroidery idol. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;She was born in 1895. From childhood, she painted, drew &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and studied at the Beaux-Arts. She wanted to be a fashion designer. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Madeleine Vionnet saw her drawings and hired her on the spot &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to start the next morning. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Marie-Louise grew up in Paris. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;She worked for Madeleine Vionnet, where she was her right-hand woman in charge of embroidery. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;She was pretty and her mother created and designed hats. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's a family run mainly by women.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There was more than one Marie-Louise at Vionnet in 1920, so she was called Yo. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;She signs her sketches Yo, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and there she is, Catherinette at Madeleine Vionnet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Vionnet asked her to design the embroidery &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and supervise it at her embroiderer Michonet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Michonet is the supplier of Worth, Lanvin, Lucien Lelong, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jacques Doucet and who works at Michonet? Albert Lesage.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Michonet was looking for a buyer and my grandfather took over the business, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which was initially called Albert Lesage. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And one day, at Madeleine Vionnet, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;my grandmother went into a room and saw my grandfather with his back to her, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;leaning over a table presenting his embroidery &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and she thought he had a lovely bottom &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and he was round. As she said it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He turned around, they liked each other and, as luck would have it, they married &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and had three children. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jean-Louis, my uncle who died very young, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the two twins, my father Bidule and his twin sister Christiane. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;They remained extremely close throughout their lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yo and Albert worked together for more than half a century. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Their aesthetic legacy on French fashion is immeasurable. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Who was designing the patterns at that time? In 1924.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My grandfather and grandmother. Very much so. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;She drew very well. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's really a family of artists. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;At the time, at Lesage, there were only women. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There were about sixty embroiderers working there, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on rue de la grange bateliere. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And design was fundamental. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are some kind of chestnuts or exploded suns. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I saw fireworks. No?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Or chestnuts too.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Chestnuts. Ah yes.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here, we're almost heading towards central Europe and Russia &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with things that are a bit more charged, crystals, silver plate. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Everything is in very pale colors, pale pink, silver, gold. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Added to this are fringes, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in this case a kind of fern or leaf veins &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on a satin, and there are many, many of them. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are also things that are almost Aztec, heraldic birds and small trees.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- These are quite generous samples in size.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yes, yes, yes, yes. And I'm fighting to keep it that way. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because convincing people of the importance and beauty of embroidery &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on something this size doesn't work. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You have to make people dream, these are samples&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; made to explode with light, to accompany the body,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; to move, to shine, to sparkle. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it's very important to have samples that are generous.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage, Albert and Marie-Louise &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;developed different types of vermicelli &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and this has been one of the house's major trademarks. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Some glitter, not very common at the time, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;was still very often made from a kind of fish or rabbit jelly. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the very beginnings of plastic. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's pretty too, an openwork, a kind of pink with threaded fringes. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You can see that these pieces, which are almost 100 years old, are still in very, very good condition. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that's one of the things you notice about embroidery: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's solid, contrary to what you might think. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And very often today, when we find embroidered fabrics, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the fabric is burnt, it's completely gone. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What remains is the architecture of the embroidery. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The threads that run through, that are so crossed, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;re-crossed and re-crossed that it continues to hold. And that survives for a long time.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1939, Lesage works with Elsa Schiaparelli, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Gabrielle Chanel's eccentric rival. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The crash of 1929 had wiped out the competition. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The number of embroidery houses in Paris fell from 20 to just ten. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;In 1939, Lesage didn't work for Chanel at all, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but he did work a lot for Elsa Schiaparelli. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And moreover, in the samples we have here, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which are not by Schiaparelli, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;he says, but there is a real influence, like this little Schiaparelli braid, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of surrealism or of a very great, I think, theatricality. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;In your opinion, how much time does that take? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this one, on top of that, it's a blade, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;there's a filler already underneath. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that's stuffing, it's always to give volume. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yes, there may already be about ten hours,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; fifteen hours just on this part. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;On the cabochons. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It might be around 30 hours on a piece like that. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;No, no, embroidery takes a long time! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1939, Europe is in crisis on the brink of the abyss. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cataclysm in five, four, three, two, one. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So what do we do before the end of the world? We dance. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There's one I love, it's the little one. Just look at him! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's incredible with the iridescent blade, it's something.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After so many years, you use the same supplies &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and you get the same effects. So that's what's crazy.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There's L'aiguille and Luneville. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are threads, gold ribbons from the laminette, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;tiny little sequin motifs there, which are green, microscopic. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's adorable, and the little elements of glass, blue glass, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;give this turquoise aspect with the changing mauve of the iridescent blade. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That's pretty amazing stuff, isn't it? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's pyrotechnic, super kitsch and at the same time super beautiful. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You can hate it, but you can't be indifferent. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Look! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What's the technique here? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's silk embroidered on a little button &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that doesn't exist, that you have to make yourself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You embroider it, make a trail and put a bit of gold thread in it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then it's like painting with a needle. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are some sort of little curlers. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are cords embroidered with gold thread on velvet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Velvet is terrible because it marks. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Who used to make curlers?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Madame Pouzieux used to do that. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it's true that we, Mr Lesage, had a lot of stock,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; so we operated for years on our stocks. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We've now found a company that has managed to take over the technique &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and make them again, which was complicated to set up.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cannetille, leather, laminette and gold twists, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;fake precious stones, chenille, trimmings, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;velvet cabochons, it's opulence. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This one is very delicate. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This must have been a jacket stocking, a pocket stocking, I don't know what. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here, there are tiny elements that have been made, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;especially with enamel and metal. It's delightful.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; There's a desire on 139's part to shine with 1000 last lights. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Well, I think everyone was in a state of anxiety about the coming of the Second World War. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And yes, there was a sort of: &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Come on, let's get carried away by the fireworks of embroidery.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- The new box. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Now for 1966. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The 30 Glorieuses, the French machine is running at full speed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage worked for Cristobal Balenciaga, Hubert de Givenchy, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Pierre Balmain, Lanvin, Patou, Dior, Saint Laurent, Madame Gres. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The result was a multicolored extravaganza of coral, topaz and turquoise pearls, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;rhinestones, matt sequins, rhodoid rods, cellophane and straw. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage sought the unexpected and saturation, embroidering on silk, organdy and organza &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to create eye-catching wallpaper effects. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's the year after the summer of love, and everyone has taken mushrooms.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So the boxes from those years, from the 60s and 70s, are my favorites. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because it's pop. Because it's a party. Take a look at these. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You can imagine little embroidered tunics for dancing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What's new is the pep, the color &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and the tutti frutti, so to speak. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's 66 67, society has changed, codes have been relaxed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We were celebrating a prosperous period, a joyous period, the economy was booming, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;people were passionate about new things, innovation and change. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Plastic was everywhere, bright colors, fringes and embroidery, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which in the 20s and 30s was still very graphic and barely suggested, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;now became almost a texture. It moves. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We're creating things that are almost like furs in plastic and shine. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Dresses have become much shorter, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;so they're almost always fully embroidered tunics &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it's all over all over all over.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Who was the House of Lesage at that time?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Lesage house at that time was my father. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Those were the years when money was flowing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The house at that time was quite large. There were almost a hundred embroiderers. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;When there was overtime at collection time, the girls, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as my father used to say, his daughters, because he looked after them, he loved them, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;he pampered them, he cooked for them.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Francois Lesage had a very paternal side. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He called them his daughters. I have to admit that fatherhood isn't really my thing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So I call them the fairies, the embroidery fairies. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;All of them. It's a great sisterhood. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yes, that's right. After that, it's true that the majority are women. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have one man among us, but yes, only one, we have only one embroiderer out of 30 people. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So it's true that we tend to say girls. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here you can see a trace of sanding on the fabric, which is the stage before embroidery. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;When you transfer the design with a carbon powder onto the fabric.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; And this is what the embroiderer uses to follow his design. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Look at this, we're going out clubbing, aren't we? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are flower motifs that are completely sequined &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;on a background of flower sequins as well. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The whole thing is blurred to make a pattern that looks like&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; it's been painted with brush strokes. But they're little flowers. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;That, on the other hand, could be very Paco Rabanne. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Incidentally, I'm showing it to you the wrong way round. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here we go. We could do a front tee shirt like this, just the front, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;kinda makes you a target. Oh well...&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You get the feeling that there's not much social questioning &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;about the future of the planet and humanity. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What counts is day-to-day life, joy and celebration. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He began to work a lot with the Middle East, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;particularly Lebanon at the time. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The Shah of Iran placed phenomenal, lavish orders, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;as did Princess Grace. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it was a particularly prosperous period, very ornate, very embroidered. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The funny thing about embroidery is that it goes back thousands of years. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;People have been embroidering for as long as man has existed. There are two tools and not one more. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The needle and the hook. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There are around 1,000 stitches, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but they are very clearly identified, and underneath these somewhat frivolous aspects, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;embroidery is an extremely serious, highly technical craft &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;which, at Lesage, never ceases to renew itself.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How many techniques do you think you know?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Oh, I don't know. Quite a few!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- More than 50?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We have new supplies, so we have to adapt to the supply, to customer demand.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The House of Lesage at the time only made maybe 100 or 120 dresses a year. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Extremely expensive dresses, practically all haute couture. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;My father had a special connection with Yves Saint Laurent, who was his great friend. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;He worked a lot with Dior. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;At the time, Lesage was more Schiaparell-esque and less Chanel-esque. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;But little by little, things evolved &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and it was my father who made the connection with Chanel. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;In his meeting with Karl Lagerfeld.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;1985 is all about virtuosity. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are the beginnings of Chanel's collaboration with Lesage &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;through Karl Lagerfeld, who has just arrived on rue Cambon&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; and commissions masterpieces inspired by the decorative arts of the XVIIIe century for haute couture.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this is 1985. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's already been quite a few years since my father took over the reins of the company. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The geographical map of the clientele has changed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Karl Lagerfeld arrived at Chanel. And trends have changed too. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;At that time, Lesage was embroidering those famous hyper-figurative suits for Saint Laurent. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage also works for Calvin Klein, Bill Blass. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are the years of Christian Lacroix, for whom Francois Lesage is godfather at Patou and soon for his own house. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Marc Bohan is still with Dior. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Micro-pearls flooded in, and 1,800 hours of work for one piece became routine. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Petrodollars are pouring in. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;For Yves Saint-Laurent's crocodile cardigan, Francois Lesage i&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;nvents techniques to achieve the effect of volume and gradation. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Billions of micro-cubes redraw the humidity of each sequin. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Since Calvin Klein's 1983 summer collections, the American market has opened up to Lesage. B&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;utterflies or caviar details or bows or mariniere bustiers &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;or 1000-light tops the likes of which New York has never seen. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;For Bill Blass, Lesage embroiders trompe l'oeil glasses on the jacket. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Francois Lesage, a media darling, becomes a fashion icon.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Le Monde has grown a little tired of this kind of permanent party &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and quest for novelty, and is once again interested in things &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;that are a little more figurative, evoking history. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Let's not forget that Karl Lagerfeld was a great collector. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;After all, he had an absolutely sumptuous collection of 18e furniture and a great, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;great devotee of the XVIIIe century. He is German Karl &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and this is what he expresses through his embroidery when he says to my father I'd like Versailles, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'd like the Trianon, I'd like the Coromandel Paravents that adorned Mademoiselle Chanel's study, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with embroidery that is absolutely marvelous, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;playing at once with matte backgrounds that bring out the brilliance, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;all the texture and mystery of eighteenthe century lacquer furniture. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And I think those were the years when my father had the most fun. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;On a piece like this 40, 45, maybe even 50 hours. Quite long to make. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is something Monsieur Lesage also liked to work on. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's the plastic blade and there's a stuffing underneath. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And this was also worked on a lot. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And Monsieur Lesage really liked this technique. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;In fact, I think the Lesage house was one of the few where this was used. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Monsieur Lesage liked to experiment?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I know the girls often worked with &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;mussels or chocolate packaging. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Are we going to 2024? 2024, Lesage is 100 years old. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Today, the premises are at the heart of 19M,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; the ambitious building where Chanel has brought together numerous crafts in a utopia of the hand. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Chanel saved the maisons d'art by providing them - and today we're at 19M - &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with an extremely solid base that gave them the freedom &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;to invent the future of the metiers d'art &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;with a reassuring, solid, friendly foundation. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The importance of the hand, of the heart, of the guts, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;of a certain humanity in the craft -&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; in the end, that's what luxury is all about. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Hubert Barrere is the artistic director. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Jean-Francois Lesage, the third generation of Lesage, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;divides his time between France and India. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Lesage works for Fendi Haute Couture,&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; Jacquemus for ready-to-wear and, of course, Chanel. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;There's at least one sample I made on it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Which one is it? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So that was from an archive. And this is it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So this is my sample. I know it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And it made its way to the collection!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Congratulations!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So 2024, yes, there are quite a few things. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here, this is the wedding dress, so there's very little material, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's cuvette, sequin, cuvette cristal, satin and chalk. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's all white, but different whites. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- What's it like to make a bride?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Well, now I'm married, I don't put my hair in it anymore. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- And that's the tradition?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;the girls who aren't married embroider one of their hairs into the wedding dress. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Wedding dress, it's not only the highlight of the show, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but there's the whole symbol of love. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's just wonderful. So when you have the wedding dress. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I can tell you that the girls in the workshop are like: WE HAVE THE WEDDING DRESS! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here we'd added jewels that we didn't have at the start, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but it was to be able to actually bring a shine &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;when the petal moves and so when everything moves, it makes a superb effect. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We're on maybe eight different sequins in all, and it doesn't feel like it at all. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;es, we understand that we don't understand. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that I think is a very Madame du Barry motif. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The colors, the delicacy of the XVIIIe century with little tassels, little chandeliers. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It was for the collection that took place at the Paris Opera. This is the front of a dress. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I love this sample. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is for the Manchester collection. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;So Manchester was the Queen of England's jewelry. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This was an interpretation of a bracelet from the '40s, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and these were big, gold chain bracelets. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is gold, let's go! Put it like that and you've still got a pretty bracelet. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Ah yes, now we have our reservation at the restaurant with no problem. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;When we arrive, we don't need to say our name.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;You show the bracelet and it's: Come in, come in! The table is ready! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And we're off to the Ritz, it's central, it's convenient. Yes. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Here's a tweed that's not a tweed, because here, by far, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's still for Manchester, the Manchester collection. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's all hand-embroidered. In fact, you can see it on the back. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's like candy! It's all crystal. Berlingots. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;These are bowls, flower sequins, little crystals, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;metal beads and crystal tassels. Again. Yeah. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;What are those stripes? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's very small sequins, it's two millimeter sequins actually, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;here, which are laid of course, 1 to 1.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It requires a healthy pair of eyes!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Yes, and the dot is tiny. But it's so beautiful! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It just looks like a little pencil line, and in fact, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;it's one sequin after another. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;This is a work of art. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;It's tone-on-tone embroidery that makes a bib. I&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;t's a bit shiny though. But when it's shiny, it's pleasing. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The samples are small now too, because we have ten collections a year after all. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And then for some collections, we go up to 100 samples. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We don't have the time to make very large samples like we used to. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;How does it feel to be 100 years old? &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Turning 100 doesn't make you any younger.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt; It's magic. Yes, it's magic. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Already, I haven't seen the last 20 years go by. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I still remember arriving and seeing Monsieur Lesage for the first time. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- What did he say to you on the first day?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I remember the last bride, I was with him and that was it. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;We both had to burn glitter. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And he'd say to me: go ahead, Cocotte, burn, burn, burn! &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I burned so much that the glitter disappeared.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I don't like the word "archive", it sounds so old. It's like being in a museum. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;For me, it's the treasures of the house, the creations. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Because in this room, there are samples from... very long ago. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And the ones from five minutes ago, they were made five minutes ago. So these are the creations. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;The great thing about our jobs is that we're always amazed. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm amazed to see these embroideries, &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;but I'm just as amazed to see what's coming out now. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;I'm not getting tired of it.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And that's what's so extraordinary, to be able to have this kind of continuity &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;between the passionate, fascinating knowledge of people who put their heart and guts into it, and the rest. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;And an existence today that fascinates more and more young people &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;in these trades that don't use any machines &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;and where everything is done entirely by hand. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;- Very good, thank you Cocotte. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Goodbye!

When a sample falls on the floor, it's a sign that it's going to work.&lt;/b&gt;
