We could not handle that as black people! That is the last thing we needed! Can you imagine if that was the black side of the family?? Really!? If Megan's dad was on TV and he was like.... Oh noooo, I'm not coming to their wedding. Noooo! Here we see Meghan's father posing for photos.... Ahh you caught me again... oh Black people would have never... Cause that's the hard thing whether you're in your... whether you... you know whether you're Arabic... whatever it is... like if you're a minority... you know that every action you commit, whole... your family. It taints your that's white people... that's like the best That's what white privilege means to me, you're an individual... Let's look at Dave... he is excellent! He's a mass murderer!! As Trevor, if I killed half of you Ahhh... Those mixed breeds!! I take everyone down with me! So much stress. So I was glad... I was glad... Like her mom was there... uh no, fly...

It's safe to say, that you've canceled That's the safest way to introduce blackness into your family... Daddy!! I'm dating a black man!! What?!? He plays the cello! Alright, bring him in, bring him in! Even white people think a cello is white. You walk in with a cello?! White people are also like... What the hell is that man? like it was a black weddding...
