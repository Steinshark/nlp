in the last lecture we have seen how to submit a network now we will see verifying the subnet using the cisco packet tracer activity as usual we will start the session with the outcomes in today's session we have only one outcome upon the completion of the session the learner will be able to verify the subnetting using cisco packet tracer so i hope you can recollect this question this question we have solved in the previous lecture subnet the ip address 216.21.5.0 into 30 hosts in each subnet and we got the answer as the first subnet will be from 216.1.5.0 to 216.21.5.31 the second subnet will be from 32 to 63 the third subnet will be from 64 to 95 and it goes on and what is the new subnet mask we know this is a classy network but we are migrating this classy network to a classless world network so that is the new subnet mask is 255.255.255.224 so with this subnet mask we can have these many networks let's verify this using cisco packet tracer the cisco packet tracer workspace is before us and i have brought in the sub networks here so we can notice this is the first subnet this is the second sub network this is the third fourth fifth and it goes on and we are going to apply this subnet mask that is 255.255.255.224 and we know this is the subnet where 32 hosts are there generally the first address is the network address and the last address is the broadcast address in the first subnet the ip address 216.21.5.0 is the network address and 216.21.5.31 is the broadcast address so this will not be acceptable for the host let's check it out now already i have configured this i have brought in a switch and i have brought in five pcs and these five pcs are connected to the switch with the help of a straight through cable let me go to this pc and let me click on the ip configuration let me assign the first address which is 216.212 obviously it should not be accepted because it's the network address of a classy network right so let's check 216.21.5.0 when i give tab it is not accepting this ip address why because it is an invalid ip for the subnet mask enter because a classy will not accept this let's try giving the last address of the first subnet which is the broadcast address still this computer should not accept it so i am giving 216.21.5.31 and the subnet mask is not 255.255.255.0 by default it will be giving that subnet mask but here i am going to change the subnet mask this new subnet mask that i am going to assign is two five five two five five two five five two to four so i'm gonna change it as two to four now let's check whether it is accepting no it is not accepting can you notice here yes the reason is with this subnet mask this 31 is the broadcast address i hope you are clear with this if you want we will take another pc let's take the third pc and we will assign a different sub network address let's take the third subnet that is 216.21.5.64 so we will try to assign this ip address to the third pc which is 216.21.5.64. so it seems to be a valid ip address in this subnet mask which is two five five two five five two five five zero because it knows the first octet is between 192 and 223 so it is taking the default subnet mask as classy subnet mask when we try to change it to a classless world using subnetting which is two to four the last octet is two to four and when i give tab or enter it's not accepting this why it is saying invalid ip for the subnet mask enter because when we use this submit mask this 216.21.5.64 is the network address likewise it will not even accept 95 the reason is 95 may be a valid ip address with this subnet mask but definitely it is not a valid ip address for the host with this subnet mask it is also saying invalid subnet mask we can assign ip addresses to all these pcs by choosing any one of the sub network we will take the third sub network and we will assign ip addresses to all these pcs that are belonging to subnetwork number three okay let me go on to the first pc let me change the ip of the first pc as 216.21.5 dot 64 i cannot assign already i have demonstrated that it is the network address so i am giving 65 for the first pc with the subnet mask 224 so let me copy this so that it will be easy for me to change the ip address let me go to the second pc the desktop i will give the ip address as 216.21.5.66 it is also a valid ip address in this sub network i am changing the subnet mask as well and let me give the ip address for the third pc as 216.21.5.67 and i am changing the subnet mask to b2 to 4 the fourth octet to be 224 this ip will also be accepted because this is also a valid ip address for the host with this subnet mask and let me change the fourth pc which is 216.21.5.68. and the subnet mask also i am changing okay i am changing the ip address of the last pc which is 216.21.5 dot we can't give 95 with this subnet mask because it is an invalid subnet mask we can't assign it to the host but i can give 94 because it is legal in this sub network so i am also changing the subnet mask we have assigned the ip address to all the pcs we will send a packet from this pc to this pc and it is successful we will send a packet from pc number two to pc number four it is also successful so all pcs can communicate with each other because it is belonging to the sub network number three once again i will confirm whether first pc and the last pc are able to communicate with each other this is the source computer and this is the destination computer we can notice that it is successful the reason is they are belonging to the same network now what i will do is i will just go to the pc the fifth pc and we know the 50 pc is assigned with the ip address 216.21.5.94 i will change it as 216.21.5.150 which is in this range which is in subnetwork number five so 150 i am changing the ip address alone now we can witness that first pc and the last pc will not be able to communicate with each other it is failed because this pc is not belonging to this network where all these four computers are belonging to sub network number three but this computer is isolated from this network because it is given an ip address which is belonging to a different network that is this sub network so it is clear that this pc number five cannot contact other pcs because this pc is not in the network of all these pcs so a router is needed in order to establish a communication among these pcs i hope now you know how to verify the subnetting using cisco packet razer it doesn't mean that two different subnets cannot communicate with each other with a switch it cannot communicate but using a router we can make communication possible among different sub networks and that's it guys i hope you guys enjoyed this lecture and thank you for watching
