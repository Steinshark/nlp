(ambient music) - [Falcon] Ah franchises. Multiple video games in a single IP. Sequels, we're often talking how they're beating a dead horse, but sometimes a franchise Hi, folks, it's Falcon, 20 game franchises that Starting off with number We have been hearing rumors about a potential &quot;BioShock&quot; It's the go-to prediction Is State of Play starting or an Xbox Director of you bet someone is gonna is gonna be announced. So far, it's just that, the he said, she said bullshit. Hell. Sorry, my inner Fred Durst Yeah, nothing. It's a series that's way too big not to bring back eventually, right? There's just money left on the table. But how and in what form The original dev team Kevin Levine, left Take which was then acquired by Take two and now they're publishing their new game, which is suspiciously &quot;BioShock&quot; like, but has the numbers filed The numbers are filed off despite the fact that they have access to the IP. It's what about whatever, whatever. It's gonna inevitably lead to Hopefully, with Levine at the helm. I could just write this whole thing off and say that &quot;Judas&quot; but it looks pretty different. You know, until Booker and Andrew Ryan show up in the third act at some point. Man, wouldn't that be awesome if &quot;Judas&quot; was a stealth Ah, it's probably not. Now, &quot;BioShock&quot; is a &quot;BioShock 2&quot; was regarded as not as good and then got a reevaluation later. Same goes for &quot;BioShock Infinite.&quot; But really, I just wanna combined with some sort of that gets into unique flavor. Just making an immersive sim in an isolated location isn't enough. Otherwise, &quot;Prey&quot; is a &quot;BioShock&quot; game. What we want is a return to those vibes that the best parts of the Doesn't need to be Rapture, Remember &quot;BioShock&quot; is which is why &quot;Judas&quot; I don't know. I will say &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; got a little lost in the meta narrative and lacked some of the that made the original But the combat, to be and the Skylines are fun especially in battle. You could say these types of Wandering around spooky corridors and listening to audio logs. You could say it's played out, but, you know, it's not exactly a problem or the genre's fault it got Everybody and their mother tried at some point. And I think the fact that a as the big ones, &quot;BioShock&quot; probably being in the top three along with the games that inspired it, &quot;System Shock 2&quot; and &quot;Thief.&quot; But just like with those games, the tough thing is making something new and to some extent, something Like as great as these games were, a lot of that was the content Sometimes the mechanics in all of these types of games, but you gotta capture what and that's probably why to make something with &quot;BioShock.&quot; And number 19 is &quot;Splinter Cell.&quot; Losing Michael Ironside, the was kind of the death never recovered after 2013's blacklist, which completed the main from grouchy and sardonic super spy to generic military man number 136. Seriously, you hear this guy's voice, he'd be indistinguishable as a background grunt in - [Sam] I'm entering the plaza Militia's blocking the front door access. - [NPC] Sam, you need to change position. Meet you on the ground. - [Sam] Get eyes from the - [NPC] Copy, moving now - [Sam] Grim, keep trying Let me know if you get - Copy. was utterly devastating. Cannot be understated just So the series has a tough uphill battle if it's ever coming back. There have been rumors of of the first game that have but so far, nothing has come of it. Ubisoft is just terrible Remember &quot;Prince of Persia: It was supposed to come and now they're saying 2026. Guys, that game wasn't complicated. What is going on over there? So the chances of this series coming back anytime soon are unlikely, but come on, it's gotta Once upon a time, stealth and &quot;Splinter Cell.&quot; That was the two premier stealth series. Serious prestige there. The first three games sold gangbusters. They innovated the stealth and they were a staple for a pretty good stretch. But once the initial trilogy was done, Ubisoft really couldn't quite figure out what they wanted the series to be. If it were up to me to revive the series, I'd go back to the semi-realistic roots, set the story in a focus on what makes the series great with hardcore in-depth stealth systems, and focus on the best And you know, taking some inspiration for more recent stealth games that really knocked it out of the park like the &quot;World of and make some massive nonlinear levels with lots of sub-objectives that can affect the course of the mission. There's so much you could do here. and with &quot;Metal Gear solid&quot; there's definitely room for And &quot;Splinter Cell&quot; could easily be it, just don't make it another That's the only real like Pratt Fall or obstacle I could foresee. Just bring it back guys. And number 18 is &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; for how popular they were and still are. It's crazy there has at reviving this franchise. Yeah, we got that oddball that nobody wanted, but a real follow-up has There isn't even like a bare or a remaster of soul reaver. There's just, there's nothing. There was supposed to be a that was gonna follow but it got canceled. Fans found footage from called &quot;Dead Sun,&quot; but still just nothing. There's nothing. It's a shame 'cause quite like the &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; games. Like even when the last few entries of it weren't like stellar, they and top-notch voice acting. - [Kain] And so I return to the fortress of the Sarafan Brotherhood, deemed impossible for Impossible for any man. - [Falcon] It'll be without the dulcet tones of Tony Jay, but he wasn't a main character The hard part I think is finding somebody to The studio most associated with is pretty much the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; team. We know that the Embracer along with several other but it's unlikely they're making a new &quot;Kain&quot; game anytime soon. You know, because of Seriously, disastrous couple If they're canceling &quot;Deus &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; doesn't It's a real shame 'cause what a modern version of It'd feel right at home with all the other dark that are actually pretty popular now. It'd just have a more and yeah, that'd be fun. I'd like that. The return of such a venerable franchise, assuming the game was good, From my perspective, it The problem is that it was who we're gonna do nothing with it. And then Embracer who is Embracer. They're probably gonna do I think for a while, they're on patching the hole in their boat. Those guys are treading I'm still kicking them when But yeah, it's a franchise owned by publishers who either refuse or can't make a new game, but they also don't wanna because you know, at some point, right? And number 17 is &quot;Dishonored.&quot; Yeah, &quot;Redfall&quot; was a flop and Arkane is in kind of with the closing of their But now's the perfect opportunity to salvage their reputation by going back to what they do best and making a new &quot;Dishonored&quot; game. They kind of sort of wrapped with death of the outsider, but there's a lot they could do with it. The setting's so unique that ending the series after two games, especially after they showed the kind of innovative stuff they can do with the setting with levels and the time travel tricks I mean that was limited Imagine the kind of crazy stuff that could come with now for a third game. The possibilities are just endless and that's what made these games so fun. Each level felt like a sandbox where you could explore everything as thoroughly as you wanted. Finish a mission in five it's up to you. There was an unprecedented in these games. It just made them such a joy to play. You could play them straight, with all these powers at your disposal. The stealth was fun, the powers were fun. Running and sliding, that I don't know what it was It was just so freaking fun to do. I know other games have it, Arkane has said the series is on hold and they're currently which with another developer, I'd probably be pretty hyped with. But I don't want an and I certainly don't want them to make generic &quot;Blade&quot; souls-like TM. Like they know how to make immersive sims. That's what they should be doing. Give &quot;Blade&quot; to Platinum That'd be a hell of a game. I'm guessing it's probably IP-based game. Microsoft probably isn't gonna with the the closing of half of them, the payloads, you know? Like obviously, I hope &quot;Blade&quot; is good and I hope it's successful 'cause I want the studio to stick around for a very long time and probably has something to do with that. If they throw down and give us something completely unimaginable, great. But I'll tell you what's a The thing that made them famous. And number 16 is &quot;Dino Crisis.&quot; With all the revivals there's one series that's &quot;Dino Crisis.&quot; It's &quot;Resident Evil&quot; with dinosaurs. There is nothing else to say. There's only two things anyone There's Regina, the main she's essential. Bringing her back is non-negotiable. And then there's dinosaurs. Like you just need to have Maybe don't set it in space. That's what they did in &quot;Dino Crisis 3.&quot; That didn't work out too well and arguably killed the series. But hey, it's not too hard to make a good dinosaur shooter, right? It's been a long freaking time too. &quot;Dino Crisis 3&quot; was in 2003. It's been more than 20 years since there's been a new That's a long time to And they brought back &quot;Dragon's Not that that wasn't a big success. It absolutely was, but The original was, you Not until late in the game and Steam sales at least. And no, &quot;Exoprimal&quot; doesn't count. It's completely unrelated Yeah, it surprised me too. And number, 15 &quot;Red Faction.&quot; This one is another one Probably nearly as close if Sadly, with the death of Volition, the hope that there would ever is pretty much dead. If we're being honest, the writing was on the Didn't seem like &quot;Saints Row&quot; was capable of making another &quot;Red Like they couldn't even that was a direct follow up. It seems like they probably as complex programming and physics wise after &quot;Agents of Mayhem&quot; It's sad, but it's the truth. &quot;Red Faction&quot; was a series long dead before volition even closed its doors. And you could argue that might be part of why Volition closed its doors. But then again, a &quot;Red Faction&quot; reboot like the &quot;Saints Row&quot; reboot wouldn't have exactly That doesn't mean we don't want someone, anyone to make a new one. I mean I guess they could and make a first person game with some modular destruction elements. The follow up to &quot;Guerrilla&quot; But you know what everyone wants and it's not wandering around a mine blowing up tiny chunks of wall. We want a new &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla.&quot; That's what the world wants, but the gaming industry steadfastly Yeah, there's been some that show off unimpressive &quot;Teardown&quot; comes to mind. It's probably the most but the rest of them are You can argue that &quot;THE probably the most extensive But it's also not &quot;Red Does that make me mad at &quot;THE FINALS&quot;? Absolutely not. &quot;THE FINALS&quot; is precious to me, but it is also not &quot;Red it's a multiplayer shooter. We're talking about &quot;Red The thing I want here is Like, okay, so if you've you do basically know what a with &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla's&quot; They handled it in fact actually better than &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla.&quot; So imagine that in a &quot;Red Faction: Best frigging thing ever. But so far, nobody's at least not on the It wasn't just test chambers It was an entire open world Yes, the world was mostly that conveniently separated each area so the game could run on an Xbox, but those were necessary compromises that the setting itself, Mars, actually in my opinion, kind of justified. So many of those problems But with the gaming community I think developers are that don't look perfect, but still incorporate at least when you're talking of looking a lot better. With a lot of indie studios, to be fair, pixel art's about as good as they could do with the idea and the And that is in no way their fault. They're the little guys and they put out incredible stuff too. It's just somebody publishing can do a lot more. And as far as I know, they're just not willing to put the money into something as experimental as this. Even though the original among the people who actually played it. I wouldn't hold my breath This is another one that got embraced because Embracer back in who was not called Koch Media anymore. They have a name that and I don't care enough. Embracer's who owns &quot;Red Faction.&quot; That's really, that's what matters. And number 14 is &quot;Deus Ex.&quot; Like I said early in the the rights to &quot;Deus Ex&quot; Funny how there are reasons You know, being a games publisher, they were gonna make a new &quot;Deus Hope was formed and then No matter what the flavor be it original year 2000 &quot;Human Revolution&quot; and &quot;Mankind Divided.&quot; Or if you're nasty and begotten, the sequel, &quot;Invisible War.&quot; Regardless, you want a new game. It's one of the seminal works with some really impressive world building and crazy immersive environments. Personally, I'd like a of the original game with and unusual philosophical diversions. Maybe with a little bit of the Adam Jensen game. Even so, I would take a with no major tonal shifts But the voice actor for Adam Jensen is all but confirmed the which sucks 'cause they never I mean the conclusion was going to be the original &quot;Deus Ex,&quot; but a lot of plot threads were never resolved and Jensen's true nature was Lots of unanswered questions and whole lot of potential And now that everybody despite its initial disastrous launch, it's gonna be a tough act to follow. If they made a new &quot;Deus Ex,&quot; now, it's gonna get compared to that game, which is a full open world RPG. &quot;Deus Ex&quot; doesn't need to be that huge. It needs to be a dense world But the way games are made now, a lot of publishers don't It is, but they don't think it is. And number 13, &quot;Onimusha,&quot; another entry, another Capcom franchise &quot;Onimusha&quot; should be an easy sell. It's &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; It's the first real offshoot that went full on action Those original games on the For some reason, Capcom to Modern Hardware, but all &quot;Onimusha 3&quot; especially, with some of the all It's fantastic and has a Yeah, that's the one with Jean Reno Time travel is involved, it is fantastic. Batshit nuts in the best way. Games set in Japan are Just this year, we've Hell, Capcom put out &quot;Kunitsu-Gami,&quot; which is by the way, fantastic. I've been singing &quot;Kunitsu-Gami's&quot; praises since it came out. Not enough people played it. If you like Pickman, tower it's those three things at Seriously, try it. It's such a good game. Nobody's saying no to more Samurai though. And for whatever reason, Capcom the series the respect it deserves. Maybe there's rights issues. The games did use celebrity likenesses for a lot of its characters, but I don't know, I kind of doubt that. Also, I don't really care, I just want more &quot;Onimusha.&quot; Revive the franchise, give it that &quot;Devil May and it'll sell gangbusters. I promise you. I know Capcom is interested in reviving long dormant franchises, so anything's on the table. So like it's just a So Capcom, do it. And number 12 is &quot;Mega Man or &quot;Mega Man Battle Network.&quot; They brought back the original &quot;Mega Man&quot; with &quot;Mega Man 11,&quot; but after that game proved Yeah, they've been putting out collections for a while now and it's cool. We can all play the &quot;Mega Man X&quot; games pretty easily nowadays. And they've got the &quot;Zero&quot; all in one convenient package there. But those are all old games. I want something new. Like you'd think we would've gotten a new &quot;X&quot; game at this point, right? That seems like the most but it hasn't happened. For many folks growing up, I played &quot;Mega Man&quot; on and &quot;X&quot; is, in my opinion, Part of the problem I think is that Capcom kind of and the last three games in the series are all different levels They really didn't realize that you just have to make You come up with new levels. You don't reinvent the wheel. The innovation is in the levels and adding new powers and stuff like that. It's not, I mean, I don't It doesn't work. Is it terrible? No, but relative to any yes, it is terrible. Also, let's talk &quot;Mega It was gonna be a sequel, and the series has just been how they could at least make Those were crazy popular games. They have one of the most in any RPG. Seeing a modern version would be fricking awesome. Like think about &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; looking like &quot;Persona.&quot; Now, Capcom's got the money, just partner with Atlas and do it. I don't think Sega would be too upset to take some cash there. Like there's so many dead Really, if you wanna split hairs, &quot;Mega Man,&quot; like where's 12? 11 was a fully realized badass sequel. It was hard as hell, but I mean not the hardest It doesn't need to be the hardest. They gave us some pretty And number 11 is &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; the true spiritual sequel It's not &quot;Perfect Dark,&quot; well, it is, but they made &quot;Perfect and &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; got So I ask you, which is the franchise that truly deserves a follow up? Both in a perfect world, but in an imperfect world it's gotta be &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; all right? There's really nothing They've got the perfect They're single player campaigns, They're just great games that managed to be the while having a unique identity of its own. What really kills me about this one is there was gonna be &quot;TimeSplitters 4.&quot; It was happening and it got Embraced. Like if it's any indicator, Embracer has a lot to answer for. It seems like every it was gonna give a comeback and then Embracer embraced Though hope is still So anything's possible when you're writing pie These kinds of lists aren't It's more wish having. If you put it out there, it's better than not That's what I'm doing here. &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; is a series that by all accounts, should return. It exists in its own little niche. There really aren't other games like it doing exactly what it does. The variety of weapons, the goofy modes, the &quot;Goldeneye&quot; style oh, and the cartoonish art style. It's really just a unique series. There is no other and it And number 10 is &quot;Banjo-Kazooi.&quot; File this one under duh. Everyone wants a new &quot;Banjo.&quot; People put millions of what is essentially a clone game. And to be frank, that paradigm and moved into being &quot;Legend of Zelda: Tears of long before that even existed. And it wouldn't bother me to see some of that stuff But here's the thing. Where's &quot;Banjo&quot;? Bring back &quot;Banjo.&quot; Everyone wants &quot;Banjo.&quot; People went batshit crazy when it got announced first for Smash, but Rare nowadays is not the same company that made the various SNES &quot;Banjo-Kazooi&quot; being one. Not to say their recent output is bad, there's just none of it or It's not bad though, just not what the fans They were the guys who did the big cartoonist levels we run around, picking up tons of crap for some reason while Giant Kirk hopes bouncy score plays. We want power ups and mini games and all that stuff that What a lot of people don't want is the custom vehicles aspect. I like the custom vehicles aspect. I think that it could exist inside the traditional not be the primary focus of it and be quite enjoyable honestly. (playful music) But &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot; is not In hindsight, I think Very creative. Again, like I said, did &quot;Tears of the Kingdom&quot; If &quot;Nuts and Bolts&quot; was just a spinoff and a third proper game had come out, I don't think anybody But the third game never happened. At this point, like just give the &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; guys. I mean all the founders of Platonic, the creators of &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; that Rare isn't anymore. So they have a pretty good grasp on how that kind of game works. The original &quot;Yooka-Laylee&quot; but the side scrolling sequel If Rare is not gonna have anything to do with &quot;Banjo&quot; though, they might as well like let somebody else do it the right way. It doesn't need to be like earth shaking. It just needs to be &quot;Banjo-Kazooi.&quot; And number nine is &quot;Burnout.&quot; It seems like every major race and game focuses on semi realism, you know, cartooning and driving carefully and precisely. That's what &quot;Need for speed&quot; and &quot;Forts&quot; and &quot;Test Drive Unlimited&quot; The lack of a game like Where are the insane speeds, Most racers basically don't What is that? And I'm not saying that's exclusive to more arcadey or insane There is pretty good car deformation in a few various racing but you just, you don't get that could be inflicted on a vehicle in a game like &quot;Burnout.&quot; Imagine a modern AAA &quot;Burnout&quot; with physics like &quot;BeamNG.drive&quot; That'd be insane. (tires screeching) (cars crashing) Soft body physics &quot;Burnout&quot; would be, that'd be a perfect game. These games are all about aggression. You crash opponents, crash into traffic and the environment. You just keep going. Crashing isn't a fail state. Half the time, it is the goal and it's got the after touchability where you can steer which allows for some vengeance even when you're careening out of control. These games are freaking awesome. Either the originals or the I'm fine with a follow The only big thing I is crash mode. It's one of the greatest They somehow turn a four-way pile up into a satisfying puzzle. The saddest thing about that made them is still around. Criterion's still with EA, but they're stuck as a support in the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; Instead of a mind blowing they're stuck making crappy that nobody's gonna play anyway. Truly, a fate worse than death. And number eight is true crime, Let's be real here. Everyone wants a new &quot;Sleeping Dogs.&quot; That game was great. A real viable alternative and that's not an easy thing to do. It did its own thing, it was different. It was more Arcadia, a without being a total It struck just the right and silly in a way that In a just world, the developer would've There would've been multiple sequels. It could have been absolutely amazing. Instead we got two kind of One great true crime game and then they had to change the name because it was acquired by Square Enix and one failed MMO follow-up The fact &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; is a minor miracle. It was even more impressive that it was actually good though. It should have been simple. Just make a sequel. That was like the first one, but better. But eh, it's not that simple. If you look at the development history, you'll see just how bizarre United Front Games has. They made &quot;ModNation Racers,&quot; a &quot;LittleBigPlanet Karting&quot; game, the definitive edition of Tomb &quot;Raider,&quot; just the definitive edition, nothing else. Sandwich between that big budget open world action gap. (dramatic music) (NPC chattering) (NPCs grunting) (NPCs chattering) (tires screeching) (NPCs chattering) Like maybe they were just I just don't know what happened. There were plans to but it never got off the ground. It wouldn't be absolutely awesome if some other talented and continue where they left off or if they would do it either way. But the likelihood of either Might as well be zero Still, even though it probably And number seven is &quot;Spyro the Dragon.&quot; That guy, he's heavily rumored to fly. Again, thanks to the newly but at the time of this writing, we have no idea what Could be a new IP, could We all want it to be. Will it be? I don't know. Once Insomniac was done with various publishers conspired to drive the First we got Vivendi's embarrassingly bad &quot;Enter the Dragonfly,&quot; then where Spyro is voiced by but Gary, Gary Oldman was in these things. David Spade as Sparx. That can't be real. It is though. Those first three PlayStation I mean this is Insomniac Those guys have been consistently good for the past 20 plus years. Toys for Bob, no slouch either. I mean they did those &quot;Skylanders&quot; games, but they've been around forever and their work on the &quot;Spyro&quot; remaster was absolutely stellar. After the &quot;Crash&quot; collection, So everyone expected they'd be doing a proper And then they left Activision. So it seemed like the dream was dead. Then they turned around and immediately made So it's possible they're and I hope they are. (dramatic music) (balloons popping) They made a lot of small, but smart improvements to the remasters. And &quot;Crash 4&quot; was absolutely excellent, barring the sometimes &quot;Spyro&quot; was never about It's more just about being a fun game with a unique move set. No other game makes it as fun as &quot;Spyro&quot; does. Nobody does it like &quot;Spyro,&quot; period. It's a simple series, but the originals really still hold up. A proper modern sequel And number six is &quot;Crimson Skies.&quot; If all you had was an Xbox, that &quot;Crimson Skies&quot; was a franchise. It actually started out on PC. The original game was super different from the more Arcadia Xbox follow up, but it's mostly still just with slightly more forgiving physics. The PC Original is a real classic, but the Xbox version's great too. They're very different games. The Xbox game, you kind of Any semblance of simulation is kind of thrown out the window. But the alternate universe, The music was absolutely great. The mission design's topnotch. It's a series that really - [Pilot] My cover's blown. Repeat, my cover's blown. I need backup. - [NPC] Attention, this in violation of David - [Pilot] It got me. (plane exploding) (guns firing) - [Falcon] I think a would really work. They could innovate by borrowing from something like &quot;Dark Void&quot; where you occasionally and do a shootout on foot. Not something I do all the time. Again, to bring up &quot;Star Fox,&quot; all the on foot crap did not work in that one &quot;Star Fox&quot; game. But I mean it would mix things up a little and if you do it right, it's good. But I mean would they do it right? That lame &quot;Front Mission&quot; reboot game also did something like that. Wasn't great. So maybe I'm asking for &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; to curl with this one, but however, this hypothetical decides to modernize the series. I'd be there for it. And number five, an actual with all the remasters and remakes and DLCs that Konami is Seriously, I mean, look It's easy to forget that there hasn't been a new Wait, I lie. There's actually the that came packed in with That's pretty much built but at the end of the It is the closest thing to something new we've seen in the series for about 10 years. So any chance there is for (dramatic music) There's so many directions. They could go with a new game, they could make a new classic game. They could go the Metroidvania route, like they could make a I'd be fine with that. It'll have to be better You couldn't make something But still, if you're dying you don't complain about someone hands you. As long as it ain't poison, you drink it and you like it. Unless it's another then get the hell out of here with that. Moving on to number four, Another series that's been for quite a while. The anti-alias games are on the original Xboxes, one of the best action games of all time. But after they flopped hard with one of the biggest unforced with &quot;Ninja Gaiden 3,&quot; Team Ninja's pretty much They still do good work and all the recent games But I can't help but revitalized version of Team Ninja could do if they return to their roots. It doesn't have to be &quot;Ninja If they wanted, they could even make a new souls-like style game. Just gotta have a jump button. Strong movement abilities are of &quot;Ninja Gaiden,&quot; along So obviously, it couldn't be but maybe they could bring back a somewhat more grounded reality where a few places almost and there were CI agents skulking around as opposed to the total But this is another case what they do, it'd just be (weapons clashing) And number three is &quot;Def Jam.&quot; These games were nuts. It's not really a surprise 'cause they were totally Had to license appearances, It would've been a fun game without rappers playing themselves, but that's really what pushes the game over the edge from an interesting curio to an all time great. It was just so much frigging fun. It was developed by AKI or AKI, I don't really say the name The wrestling game guys. And it plays like a streamlined It works though 'cause honestly, it's a lot better than back then and even now. They just hit the perfect temp where fights are flashy and fun, but they don't drag on too long and they're really accessible. It's easy to jump in, jump and that's the best way Period. The first two games are all time classics and have a pretty good cross section of major acts from the early 2003s. Imagine if they made It'd be totally crazy, I loved these things as a kid. The music, the presentation, it's just so much frigging fun. It feels like something in the 2000s. I can't see the biggest and appearances to something He would probably do it. And number two is &quot;Siren.&quot; The first two &quot;Siren&quot; games and published by Sony were They're some of the most But outside of an ill with &quot;Siren Blood Curse,&quot; the series has been dead They didn't catch on but I think now they would of catching an audience. They're grungy, a little They have impenetrable stories that can only be fully understood after multiple playthroughs. That sort of thing wasn't as a positive back then, but now, oh, we love our obscure games, don't we? (ominous music) - [NPC] Did you see anything else? (NPC panting) - [NPC] They are no longer. (NPCs chattering) - [Falcon] The most There's real potential for a revival too. People love horror games now, especially spiritual Wowee. The main problem for any They've all but shuttered and don't seem that interested as strange and unsettling as this one. Its appeal is too limited for Sony looking for the next big live service hit as if that's gonna happen. They don't want moody horror games. They want &quot;Concord,&quot; and cost like $200 million. Maybe they should go back to or just single player games in general. It seems like Sony is going where they forgot why people like them. And finally, at number one, &quot;Chrono Trigger.&quot; &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; makes this but let's not fool anyone here. As much as &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and it does do stuff that I like it, but we really A proper follow up that is the same fast-paced and fun story, the time hopping shenanigans, and that fantastic iconic score. &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; did at The music for &quot;Chrono but for the most part, it's The original &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; from almost any RPG of that time. Help, it's different from It's stood the test of time, right? Appropriate given the theme.
