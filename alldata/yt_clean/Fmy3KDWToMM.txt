- Shortly, everything that will explode today, we killed. That`s the way it is. -- Ooh. Good. -- N-nah! - Out the window. Great work. - Take it easy. Drop. *** - Instead of ***, what should we write? - Congratulations, friends! My call sign is Abdullah, I am the commander of the TERRA unit. A year has passed since TERRA has been fighting in the Bakhmut direction as part of the third assault brigade. I want to thank all those who support us on this path. And for everyone who wants to get involved, we currently have an active fundraiser for kamikaze FPV drones, and also for preparation for the winter military campaign. The link of fundraising fixed in the description of the video. We also have Patreon and Telegram channel. Subscribe to our YouTube, donate to TERRA, donate to Armed forces of Ukraine. Only together we will win. Glory to Ukraine! -- Shorlty, yesterday's tigers said: &quot;We need 3.5 km to the goal.&quot; I gave them the points and they said: &quot;Well, we looked - our equipment drives there. It does not suit us.&quot; I'm like... saying: &quot;Wow...&quot; - Look, guys - camouflage Glovo. - And I know, there is an ikebana ***. - Gentlemen, where is the fire? - Greetings! Gentlemen, where are the incendiary ammunition? - We got in the edge, it flew there. -- Because men are writing, the incendiary ammunition hit. -- Who went to replace ours down there. - Maybe you were burned and we died a long time ago from shelling and we are all in hell. - Look, Mykola: organizer... I put all the details here. -- Mom, I'm burnt down and hungry dogs... (Sings). Fine. The organizer is beautiful. - Shortly, everything that will explode today, we killed. That`s the way it is. -- Oh, I learned how to carry the Mavic-3 properly. Look - take like this... You can with it ***. -- The drone is connected, ready to take off. Take off! It's an eight, by the way. -- The target is an enemy infantry fighting vehicle that blew up on a mine. The combat vehicle drove a little further, and then the crew abandoned it. At least those who survived the explosion. The pilot of the FPV drone was given the task of finishing off the equipment, since, in fact, it is still intact and the russians have the opportunity to tow it away for repair or disassembly for spare parts. - Give me directions where we are and where is it? - That's where the bushes are, right? - Here? - Understand. - I'm getting lower. Is this it standing? -- In the engine. Great work. -- FPV drone hit an armored combat vehicle It was possible to see how the cover on the frontal part jumped up and the flames were clearly visible. According to the result of after reconnaissance, we see that the infantry fighting vehicle engine is on fire. The flame coming out of the exhaust hole is clearly visible. Armored vehicles fired up nicely. Upon closer reconnaissance, we can see that the tower was torn off as a result of the detonation. The equipment is 100% destroyed. We are satisfied with this result. - Well, let's see now. - Well done. - What did you hit with? -- On the way back, we need to find out the direction of the wind a little. - Well, look. Now, if we drive them out, let's drop shrapnel at them. I think they will be upset. - It is difficult to assess whether he is 300 or not. - Well, we cheered him up, yeah? - Yes, beauty. - That's it, I turn it off. -- Radik asked to report very quickly today. -- N-nah!. - Wait, how come? Did you fly away so fast or something? I can not understand. - What? -Have you stalled? - Got it. - The killer. So Zhora is death *** - An infantryman. - Eight-inch drones. With a larger weighting capacity, a slightly different compound. We will now test with anti-personnel high-explosive ammunition. What is written... Nothing is written here, but here it is written: &quot;Hackfall&quot;. Such an explosive. This is a thing from the cluster ammunition of the Hurricane. The tail was cut off... here it was... ...because we don't need it. Will be used with kamikaze drone. 3 kg of weight. -- Somewhere the barrel artillery started to work. Some skunk wants us dead. - Do you hear, Yura, their barrel artillery pissing me off already ***. Maybe you can cheer them up there too? Because they are cheering us up here. -- So, food blog: TERRA. We work in the Bakhmut direction. We eat striped tuna in brine. And I always thought that it was in it`s own juice. Delicate tuna and pineapple. Go away fly! Good pineapple, by the way, fresh. Have you tried? -- When people ask me: &quot;Are you even fed there?&quot;. I wonder where they got this from... (gunshots) - Ah, you dog... ...it really twists me. I think: &quot;What do you mean... do they even feed them? We have a supply here for ***.&quot; -- The first army of the world. -- Like: &quot;they don't feed us&quot;. -- A girl I know tells me that she has a girlfriend, who still sews underpants from old underwear and gives them to some people at the front. Well, not to the front, but to some kind of territorial defense forces. - But this is all fraud. You know this when the humanitarians have collected and someone sold it somewhere...ugh. - Listen. -- Pineapples were given by the state. They say: &quot;I don't know what's going on. Why can't Mavic-3 be near?&quot; I don't know either... (Explosion sound) - It's because of the Mavic-3, right? - Somewhere close. -- *** katsaps go to ***. Let me eat the pineapple. (Explosion sound) - Yeah. Sick of them. I'll now take the trash out quickly. - Pineapple in the trash. Hygiene must be observed in war. Everything is sticky after pineapple. &quot;Yura, we are covered by barrel artillery here.&quot; Drove us into pits and shoots at us. Something needs to be done. Let *** fly and hit it***. - I can do that too. - Call Deep. - Yes. - What is there, they are swarming? - Okay, let's get high-explosive fragmentation now in ***. -- To enemies***. Go have a look. Go to Pasha and look. - There he is. - Look. -- Here is such a shuriken-like trench. There are one, two, three. - Zhora, is it the same or what?? -- Ammunition is fixed. Connect? Question. - Minus. *** -- Now a scout is flying in and we are taking off with an FPV drone. - Shortly, friends, look what we need. This is what this trench looks like. Photographed. Now. Here is the *** crushed munition, and you need to find it here. There is *** crushed munition. Understand? This is how it looks from above. -- Are they now in the APC area? - Yes, I will make it. -- Will you guys have time to confirm? -- *** - Come on, come on. Let's go. -- The drone is connected. Let me go away. You can fly. - Plus. I get up -- Let's fly a seven-inch, shrapnel one, this one, evil. Friends, are you coming? - Yeah, yeah. - Look at them. - You can see them, right? - No? - Now he will fly quickly. -- We observe two infantrymen moving in the direction of ***. We flew over them with an FPV drone. - Are they there? - They entered the building. - Go, come to this place. - Can someone go and show Deep this? Can you go show him? Show him the house. Zhora, let him pass. Show the house, drive over there a bit. - Move a bit, I need to look too. - It's about the third or fourth house on the right along the street. - From the beginning. - I mean from you. - Look, Pasha, we are maneuvering. - This one, in the sights? - This one? - Into the window. Great work. Is there an explosion? - Was there an explosion? - Yes, there was an explosion. All is well. Oh, well done, great job. Deep, great work. Finally. - There are definitely 200 and 300. -- In ***, they led the FPV right into the window of the house, where two *** enemies entered. Detonation confirmed on Mavic 3. That's it ***. Glory to Ukraine! - Glory to heroes! - Great! Everybody well done. I went to gear next, that's what I'll tell you. - Pavel! - There is a tank, have you read it? - Irzhen, get up. It's time for you to go to work. - Deep! -- I gonna go to put the cumulative ammunition. -- Yes, the cumulative ammunition is installed. Ready to turn on on command. -- Between *** goes infantry fighting vehicle. - Yes, yes. It turned... -- ...turned and it is going in the direction of ***. - It is going to us... - Go, look. Come on, now we'll catch it and *** destroy it. -- Zhora, replace the battery - you need to fly to the infantry fighting vehicle reconnaissance. -- While we will scout for it, it will *** us... we can't fly to nowhere. - Do you know where it is? - That's it, I'm flying. Let's take off. The drone is connected. I'll go check the pre-plug. Yes, the pre-plug detached. -- Went to the right from ***. -- Taxi driver, connection ***. - Our client. - On the right? - Where should I look for it? - From that side. - Turn on the video. - Done? Shoot. Take it easy, take it easy. - Done? - Yeah. -- Yura, an FPV drone with a cumulative ammunition hit an infantry fighting vehicle, which moved from Kurdyumivka to Andriivka. Getting into infantry fighting vehicle. Sounds good. Gentlemen, I got all the crap of the explosives. Let's pack. -- I sent you a video report. -- We will summarize the results. Infantry fighting vehicle was hit, infantry was hit... -- The house was hit with *** enemies. - The infantry was shaken, four holes were hit. As they say: &quot;We had a nice walk.&quot; - Saliber rocket launcher system was received, barrel artillery was received, incendiary ammunition was received. - What else? As they say, if you love to give, you also have love to receive. -- Su-25 pissed of. As we say: &quot;Glory to Ukraine!&quot;
