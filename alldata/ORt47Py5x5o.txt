so I was on the internet I know I shouldn't have been interneting and I ran across this post okay it's hot off the presses so I guess this is a thing now universities running ads to resell students data for training llms okay uh Susan uh Google Deep Mind pass meta AI open AI Unity games wow worked at worked at literally all the places all right University of Michigan llm training data hi Susan I'm reaching out because based on your profile you may be working with large language models llms or natural language processing I wonder if they used an llm to determine the candidates to send this information too curious uh I wanted to let you know that University of Michigan is licensing academic speech data and student papers that could be very useful for training and or tuning llms first off TJ is in shambles TJ you should be in shambles what the hell's wrong with your school but second I I I I do want to just throw something out out there do they not realize I'm sure they do but do they not realize that students papers are generated by llms doesn't that cause like a this whole like circular problem where you have like feedback Decay yeah feedback Decay like going way way way way way high llm training llm I mean I don't know if you've been using chat jippy lately but in the last year and a half Chad jippidy's overall performance has gone has gone genuinely down I don't see how anybody would say that it is as good as it was day one now to be fair to be completely Fair my amazement at what it can produce versus what it actually was producing could be purely like rose-colored lenses like have you ever used something for the first time and it's really fantastic but then as it goes on it's not as good this happens with like food sometimes you eat a food and your first bite is really really good and it's just like out of control and then your next one is just not as good or heroin classic One chasing the dragon I mean that's where it comes from Trace chasing the dragon it got really bad I'm not sure if it got really bad or if my expectation has gone up and it has stopped going up in proportion to my expectation meaning when we started chat jiid 3 was pretty good then 3.5 came up and so my expectation Rose proportionally and then Chad chippity 4 came out and my expectation Rose proportionally and maybe it's degraded by 5 or 10% or whatever it is but my expectation kept going up and to the right like a good oldfashioned ston and it's going not stons right now and so it's like it feels disproportionately worse no it's objectively way worse way I mean objectively and way worse you used a very subjective term to describe how objectively it changed like what what do you mean objectively it's not as good as it was as it 10% worse what's how do you measure its accuracy all I know is me me personally I I find it really annoying but I also kind of found it annoying back in the day but I was just too like I was too bedazzled by it I was very I wonder if it has decreased in goodness due to having to remove copyright content you think it removed copyright content hold on you let let me get this straight you think that you think that they removed copyright content from something in which is a bunch of medians the world's largest IFL statement generator ever you telling me that they some how we're able to magically remove it anyways let's keep on going the overview of U of M's data sets TJ's album mod speech data 65 speech events from various academic settings lectures discussions interviews 85 hours of highquality audio recordings in MP3 format extremely accurate trans uh transcriptions in XML format why are Subs in XML anyways I think there's like a standard uh there's a standard format that is XML if I'm not mistaken uh anyway speech data academic student papers 829 Papers written by University of Michigan seniors and graduate students cover 16 academic disciplines social sciences physical sciences engineering Etc the one-time license fee for the data sets are academic speech data $15,000 academic paper data sets $122,000 combined speech and uh paper sets uh $25,000 okay so let me get this straight I just want to I just I just want to understand something really quickly the papers that you assembled from all the students Al together aren't even the cost of tuition for a year you're bang on your buck you know I'm just saying you're this is pretty good here okay you're getting a lot of opportunity I mean the quality that they're producing is obviously they don't have very high confidence in it also this feels really odd I mean how would you feel that you spent three years writing a paper in your master's degree and then it and then it comes out and they're just like yeah you plus all of your friends plus everyone you've ever known plus every other Department's ever known we put them all together and we valued all of your papers together at $12,500 like semide decent you know 829 papers uh what is it it was 12595 divided by 829 uh you know I would just like to let you know that your three years of effort was worth $15.19 for us to sell just let you know pretty good per client per client in other words they could recruit less than one additional student and replace uh and replace their entire venue resource uh or Source or Revenue source and never have to violate privacy like that yeah so per place that's buying these training datas as Judo just said if they had say 50 people that were interested in all of this they could also figure out how to get 50 more student students instead and not seem like a just like a horrible violation of of what feels like there something about this just feels really weird I I'm letting them cook before I give my opinion okay I'm trying to let them cook to give them the opinion right now uh free sample of data if you'd like to see a free sample of both data sets please click request sample data provide your email and then I'll email you the sample file and if you have any questions feel free to email me directly at this thing uh I think you could have doxed them nice dick by the way um big pck come on inappropriate okay this is a learning adventure Susan um all right so here's my general take on this that I think obviously the landscape in the world has changed vastly in the last couple years and so the value of your content that you produce at a university has vastly changed I think we can all agree that that exists right uh because before what did they do with all these papers and everything well they didn't really do anything right it was just like hey maybe some of them uh maybe some maybe some of them they can actually get out and get published but a lot of them they're just thesis papers they don't actually ever get anywhere and that's that and fantastic okay awesome but now there's a whole new world in which you know there's an eager desire for more and more information to be able to train these models to become better and better and better uh if they got consent or you signed a paper that's my assumption is that if you went to college you signed a piece of paper or an agreement that said all work produced here is owned exclusively by the college itself so I hate to tell you this but you're kind of up a river Without a Paddle on this one if you're upset about it in the sense that you already signed it away it's just that this vertical didn't exist potentially at the time you signed it that's my assumption and I'm pretty sure that's true that whenever you go to a a a school you sign away your rights to the things you produce that it's that everything you produce is on behalf of the school itself thanks for the black pill Prime no I mean it's just the reality right yeah we're talking about the legality of everything and is it ethical let me ask this question what makes it not ethical because I have a lot of feelings about this I'm trying to like reason about why I feel that it's unethical but I can't I can't I don't have a good reason why I think it's it like unethical what makes it unethical yeah no I mean this this right here forget that the the quality of the majority of these has to be poor yes that that's a completely separate question I'm not talking about that MSU uh follow let's see follow standard academic practices in disclaiming ownership of and royalties proceeding from traditional academic Works books essays works of art musical composition and recordings and the like unless one or more special circumstances exist the special circumstances that cause the university to retain copyright ownership are set forth in section two below works with special circumstances exist for which the university retains ownership are called University owned I think the reason one might feel that it's unethical is because those right right assignments generally only exist to protect the university not for them to profit off of okay but times have changed right you know like at one point some natural resource may have been considered dumb and then at some point it became highly worth and highly valuable and then all of the sudden the person who owns the mineral rights now get gets to make a lot of money I'm just trying to think of this I'm trying to think of this in a a reason why it's this is valuable or not valuable the real MSU is here in Montana not where you live exactly bisco is absolutely right real real MSC is Montana State University in Boseman Montana not this crap Michigan but I'm just trying to reason about why this is why I don't like it and I don't have a strong reason why I can say I don't like it like I I I honestly can't come up with something other than it gives me the ick yeah it feels scummy but that's not how ethics work you can't you can't say something is ethical because you don't like it you have to say it's e it's not ethical even if the courts don't decide right it's not ethical because of certain things students can't opt out yes they can students can most certainly opt out it's called don't go to MSU right like you sign up to go to a school and all works that you produce go to the school like this has been a thing forever like if you think that you get to produce something at school and then go and make money off of it like you're going to be sorely upset about that right it's not like I can take my Master's thesis produce some piece of software and then attempt to to to just go sell it it's not mine to sell double dipping feels wrong okay double dipping I can say that can you say that blizzard is not unethical in their treatment of workers because they chose not to work at blizzard that uh well there's there's potential Visa issues that they're holding over people's head this is very this this is a different thing okay working at a job you need money to survive going to college is not something that you need to survive meaning like nobody here needs to go to college if you don't go to college it's not like oh I guess I'm homeless now because I didn't go to college like there there is a fundamental Bas there is a fundamental difference between these two in this economy actually yes right now trades work is going out of control we actually don't know that the students didn't explicitly sign up or whatever that's what I'm saving the document has no basic uh basically oh okay that's fair so we can say we don't know let's go with one of two things if one the students never signed their workway and it's being sold on their behalf it's clearly illegal okay it's illegal it's coercive everything is coercive everything that you sign up for is coercive you are being coerced into a certain set of values or whatever no matter what you do isn't Montana State University the same as University of Montana you are an ignorant [ __ ] and you do not understand um that's the Grizz versus I mean everything is so that I mean that's not a good argument here I'm trying to think of what makes this bad and I'm I'm I'm failing to really come up with why this is bad Dana White that's [ __ ] illegal like yeah late stage capital is generally icky I'm not sure there's good and bad things if the students didn't have a choice and they and they and yes selling student data is clickbait for selling student uh papers they wrote uh for the University that's fair it's a public university chck and stops being stupid about M capitalism yeah universities literally operate on the the iners bases of capitalism okay it's a big nothing Burger well it I think it makes people feel really uncomfortable like everybody here type one in the chat if you feel pretty uncomfortable about this so okay so a lot of people are not happy about this so this is why we're talking about it because it's worth talking about it because it's not it's not clear it's not clear the ethical conundrum here I wouldn't want to go to university if someone was going to sell my crappy paper for $15 why you got to say rotating phaser you now have to give a a a reason why that would be I have made hundreds of thousands of dollars off of my degree I have paid off debt I've paid off my degree I've been able to make money and support my family and if somebody sells my stupid paper for $115 I do not care at all like at all not even in the slightest I'm just saying like personally that that is not that's that's dumb so if they want to Json versus XML case study performance whatever it was called there you go research gate if someone sold my paper that I'm a part of right here fantastic I don't care I don't feel like any of us can I I haven't heard a compelling argument for why this is unethical other than just feels wrong it just feels yucky right say his name uh this is literally labor theory of property from John locks being dismissed by a writing in a paper double dipping isn't an more moral argument double dipping is not a moral argument it really isn't if like if you could come work for me and I and you had the promise of getting a life that is very nice for you in the future and you had to produce something that I could sell and it's completely optional then it's hard to say it's unethical right no one needs to survive by getting a degree in fact right now people are largely thinking universities are the opposite of of becoming financially free is going to a university and getting some [ __ ] degree right now degrees are more and more worthless unless if you're a doctor or a civil engineer right it seems like it's it's it's really really really different do you get a royalty I don't get a royalty from what it feels like 85 hours of audio makes me think they explicitly got consent that's way too small of a data set to be a random spying on people agreed yeah the 85 so the Audio I think actually TJ you bring up a good point which is the audio is the kind of the more question one which is how do they uh you know how do they obtain this well if you give a speech on campus you're giving it into a microphone and and I would assume you think it's being recorded right I wrote a very personal essay for psychology that did a deep dive into my childhood trauma analyze how I've grown and everything there that one see that one I kind of don't want to be in the AI brain I wrote it with the knowledge of who the audience would be they're changing that I should I should be able to opt out okay I mean I understand I understand your argument which is that you you you gave up personal information yeah it's all it's a University of Michigan oh we'll come back to that so that's like I'm just trying to reason why that's bad and I'm not saying like I don't feel for you in this personal thing I'm just trying to real like I'm just trying to like ethically try to determine why that's bad you gave up information for a psychology class cuz you may have been compelled to by a teacher to to give up such information for to later be used theoretically in training of an AI thing that you weren't aware of that you know the landscape changed out of underneath you I think what would not give me the ick and make me feel fine is if all these places if they could do it from here on out meaning that since the landscape has changed so much if from here on out it's a part of contracts and all future things and maybe that's the case maybe due to how small like I mean that's not a lot of papers TJ says there's 52,000 students at MSU and there's only 829 papers so maybe this was a going forward thing in which they actually explicitly did get a lot of uh a lot of uh or explicitly say that they're going to be using this paper for training and so maybe there is or University of Michigan U ofm maybe there is something here that is a little bit different here than than we can we can understand or a lot of [ __ ] students I do like the MSU is getting the blame yeah I know I'm blaming MSU yeah fmsu Michigan of course Michigan State not not Montana State anyways okay um I think this is I think this is too intense Susan I think I think you really do got to take a moment and find out what does it mean like who are all these students because again very few students papers very few papers in here and I'm curious like why would they even do this with 52,000 students assuming each student is paying $10,000 a a semester like what are you trying to get out of here for a one-time license fee you know what I mean like what what is the school trying to get out like the bigger L here is the fact that they're selling peanuts while they have like a giant oil Cash Cow sitting there like that's I think that's the part that I'm more confused about is like let's just say they're able to sell 500 of these it's like literally nothing comparatively to their to their budget you think they're testing the waters how many companies are buying llm data like there has to the upper limit to that has to be relatively small and when I say relatively small I mean it's not in the millions like you can't like you can't make it into some like Mega vast amount of money they can make it's like it's it's a really small portion of things that they can actually sell to they just need to a precedent set wellan even if they set a precedent you're still I know I'm going to give myself on this one that we don't have enough information it's hard to say that it's ethical or unethical because I don't think anyone has provided a real argument for why something is unethical if you go to a college they use the information you produce if you didn't understand that that is your fault for not reading it in the all the things you sign now if they did not collect that information if they did not get your permission if this is University and which did not make you explicitly sign something then they're clearly breaking the law and you'd have have like legal recourse and then that is unethical cuz you took something that was not yours but if you willingly gave them this information then it's hard for me to say that like like like my tweets I say a lot of stupid [ __ ] on the internet if people used my tweets to train the world's stupidest AI That's like what am I supposed to say you can't you can't do that no it's like dude I opted into that I I opted into it right I opted into this and that's that and so that's that's where I have a hard time right it's like being upset that if you send a bunch of dumb slack message to your co-workers that can be used against you for firing right like don't say dumb things in slack or email that you wish people not to look at yeah okay I can I mean I can see this I can see this I can see this argument that you're describing GP gdpr even even though people click agree it does not mean people will understand that their information will be sold eventually I mean I don't know how stupid you have to be to think that putting information onto the internet will not be used against you I think this is really just uh pinpointing the very real misconception we have about Higher instit Learning institutions uh as of places of learning and research that will protect student data from privatization in reality they are predominantly businesses farming the ideas as money which has been in the fine print in most universities for the last several decades there's a connection between ideal and reality not only that but you got to remember that every single Paper produced by uh by colleges right now every like they they they pursue their professors to try to get grants and when any person gets a grant uh to go research something let's say the government gives a university $10 million to go research this very important topic the university like off the rip takes I forget I've heard numbers I forget the exact numbers but it is an absurd amount of of the percentage just goes to just the University it's like 40 to 60% of it some like very high number and so if you think that somehow universities are this Bastion of moral goodness they it is like it is the world's biggest nepotism like ever it is it is the worst place for nepotism it is the worst place for this kind of stuff and so if if you're if you think it's somehow this great place come on like I think I think that you have I think that you have a little uh something going on up here where you're not thinking too hard you know what the name is the name is the primagen by the way I do also support getting a a computer science degree I think they're really great I explained that earlier so it's not like a uh it's not like it's not like me I'm not [ __ ] on universities okay I think there's a lot of great I think there's a lot of great things universities do I'm not saying that but I also think that if you think that they're going to be somehow this it's it's no different than expecting a company to be moral stop thinking companies should be moral companies are not moral they're not going to come out being this moral great place that is why every single time one of these nonprofits come out saying they're doing all this moral good you find out that their leaders are like sexually assaulting their co-workers or some awful thing that's because corporations are not moral entities universities aren't moral entities they're not going to be there doing something fantastic okay this is not capitalism in America this is humans in charge of power degrade into awful awful things almost universally okay that's that that's that if you think that power does not corrupt you are a fool a
