all right Unity has dropped the open letter to the community let's hear what the CEO once quoted saying our customer are idiots let's see what the letter has to say to our community I'm Mark Whitten I lead the unity create which includes the unity game engine and editor teams I want to start with simply this I am sorry all right so I I'm gonna try to represent what I think is the average person's thought going through this for a quick second okay so I'm not trying to completely dog on you mark Whitten which sorry I'm calling you mark Whitney from the Martian great great show but right away you lead teams I doubt you were the full decision maker in this process you know what I mean I doubt you were the one making these decisions yet here you are saying you're sorry I think that's the first thing I just noticed is that it just feels weird that you're the ones doing it I know you feel like the scapegoat we should have spoken with you uh with more of you and we should have Incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new runtime fee policy our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow and keep deeply investing in our game engine I mean good goals I think can we all agree those are good goals are these good goals yes you'd want if you're relying on a commercial engine you want to feel supported you want to know that the future is well paved that supports can continue to grow and that they can continue to invest in the engine we want all those things I don't think anybody here wants something different you you are what makes Unity great and we know we need to listen and work hard to earn your trust we have heard your concerns and we are making changes in the policy we announced to address him our Unity personal plan will remain free and there will be no runtime fee for Games built on Unity personal okay I mean that that's good that's good we will be increasing the cap from a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand and we will remove the requirement to use uh the made with unity splash screen I don't know what this cap is what's this cap for what do they mean this cap does anyone know specifically No Cap what's this cap you need a license okay so so you have to get off the personal plan starting at that license is that what they're saying they're capping no game with less than one million in trailing 12 Watts Revenue will be subjects to the fee wasn't this already the case in the previous one correct this was already a thing it was trailing 12 months 1 million now 200k is when the fee would initialize uh original Here original Unity a fee uh here uh what's called uh install fee there you go unipro that will made 1000 or more in the last 12 months okay those that made more than okay personal it's those that have made more than 200 000 in the last 12 months whereas with the pro and Enterprise is those that have made a million more okay so I was getting a little confused myself okay fair fair I was a little 200k for personal 1 million for the other ones okay I still don't know what this cap is I honestly don't know what this cap is right here for those creators on Unity Pro and Enterprise we are making also making changes based on your feedback the runtime fee policy will only apply beginning with the next LTS version of unity shipping in 2024 and beyond your games that are currently shift and projects you are currently working on will not be included unless you choose to upgrade them to this new version of unity that's actually really good okay so this is a really good concession can we agree that this is a good concession because like think about how many games like Atlanta Lux developing strain three years developing strain and it was going to be done near December like she was gonna drop this game and then just get pronoun by the fee so to me okay good concession better at least it's better I'm not saying it's I'm not saying it's all good I'm just saying that this is at least a good concession we will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the new version of your Unity editor you are using as long as you keep using that version for games that are subject to a runtime fee we are giving you the choice of either a 2.5 percent Revenue share or the calculated amount based on the number of new people engaging with your game each month both of these numbers are self-reported from the data you already have you will always be billed the lesser amount that is better because Unreal Engine which is a by far superior engine in all ways is five percent Beyond a million dollars this one's saying it's 2.5 percent the engines obviously doesn't have all the bells and whistles that unreal does but nonetheless they're reducing it down okay or if they invert it because remember they did claim that some percentage of games would actually make more money on a per install fee versus a revenue share and if that's true then this would allow you to kind of have an either or the self-report part little confused how that works it also goes to show the self-report part goes to show how vastly underquipped they were to handle the fee that they were attempting to charge you know how they were saying that they were going to charge it per install and then they're like oh but actually we will only do new installs how are we going to determine it's a new install magic system okay how are you gonna determine in your magic system that's a new install well you know we have a lot of AI and we're very it's very special it's like this on the other hand is better but still so I don't understand what self-reported means uh let's see I think it's like taxes you self-report your taxes and get uh and get in trouble if it's wrong how much do you owe us 50 000 wrong go to jail damn it so let's keep on going we want to continue to build the best engine for creators we truly love this industry and you are the reason why I'd like to invite you to join me in a live fireside chat hosted by Jason Wyman today at 4 pm 1pm uh 4 P.M Eastern 1 p.m specific oh snap we're gonna live stream that where I'll do my best to answer your questions in the meantime here are some more details thank you for caring as deeply as you do so here's my problem and I think that I could semi-accurately represent a lot of people's problems here which is why was it so bad in the beginning if you truly do care for us to begin with why was it done in complete stealth if you truly do care for us to begin with why wasn't feedback sought if it was truly because you care about us and instead this feels like hey we totally screwed up but we don't want to lose our company trust us we're actually the good guys that's how it feels to me it still feels a little bit you know odd someone's asking why doesn't the why was the repo removed if you didn't care so I actually did talk to a Unity employee about this the repo was removed long before they made this announcement so there was a bit of uh a confusion apparently at least that's what I was told I don't know how to like I don't know how to validate that that statement other than uh they yeah other than that I mean that's the problem is now you get into this now we get into like what I call the conspiracy side of things is they actually knew this was coming therefore they pulled it all out um also very interesting because they at one point I think in the terms of service they guaranteed they would not do a REV share model they they are apologizing because they're supposed to they are supposed to apologize so I am happy that they're apologizing I am happy that they are listening to the people this totally feels completely fair that only new versions of unity will receive this fee I think that's completely completely completely fair that means if you don't want this fee you can continue to use these older versions of unity until some time in which they deprecate I don't know how the deprecation Works in unity land I also think that this is probably more fair saying hey we're gonna do a REV share but at the same time I would expect if they're gonna go a REV share model they at some point probably need to drop these Unity Pro and Enterprise kind of see it's like why are you paying for seats to use the software plus a fee to sell the software it just seems weird right you don't pay for uh unreal seats and unreal rev share you pay for unreal rev share and so it just kind of feels you know a little bit odd but you know in the end I said this last time on the last Unity video I really liked using Unity it was something I really have genuinely appreciated and so therefore I hope that this can be resolved and things are good and ultimately that they can learn from it because you know companies can learn I hope that a few people in the c-suite actually do get fired I know it's I I would never want to be fired from the c-suite but I do hope that there's some change that it restores the the confidence of people like you know that are using your product that hey we're serious about it people had to roll were making changes we're going to keep you top and foremost in mind here you go like to me that would feel it'd feel better honestly that's my personal thought a little harsh maybe it's a little harsh uh it's so strange a team lead is the communication it is strange a little that a team that a team lead is a communication and not someone higher up um I mean Mark Watney obviously did a great job surviving on Mars and so therefore probably good that he did the communication you know he's pretty good at it uh it's good that they went back and said sorry but people who came up with it and pushed it should be let go I actually pretty much agree with that because that means they totally are disconnected from what people want for me it's more of a practical purpose there exists a group of people within this company that are so far fractured from what the community deems okay and not okay that they could come up with the policy that they have to backtrack and write saris and poor Mark Whitney Whitton here getting bust by everybody and he's the one doing all the sharing right like it just seems so broken to begin with it's just something about it feels wrong but I really ha I'm very happy with the result I hope that everybody who's been freaking out because honestly I genuinely feel so bad for all the game developers who who for like who literally thought that their effective life was over for development because their company was going to go bankrupt all the kids programs all those ones that don't that don't sell ads that don't make ton of monies that we're gonna go bankrupt because the runtime fee like they're thinking how am I switching to Godot how am I making these huge changes like they were in panic mode and I feel genuinely sorry to have your like your livelihood potentially taken away in a single day which is just wild you know game devs are already stressed out to the max at least we can say that we can have trust that they will listen to feedback but we may not have trust about future decisions they make all right hey the name I mean the name we're skeptical now we have trust issues but I'm glad you made some good decisions again
