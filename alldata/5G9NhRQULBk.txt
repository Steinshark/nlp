I honestly don't think you guys are ready for this I don't think you're ready for this we're going to slander some code [Music] editors I didn't quite get the last one I'm going to have to like relook at this one it's saying that emx users don't know what a woman is wait is woman for man manual entry I don't get it do do I not get this one so woman's for manual entry I don't use I don't use emac skill issue I don't get it at all Man pages I know about Man pages manual pages I've heard about manual pages oh no match for you and a woman I don't this is not it's not even a good joke this is a good joke though the amount of times I've seen somebody when I'm like hey man how many times does this appear in some downloaded Json or something like that and someone's like oh how many times does it appear in let's pretend it's like uh the the let's see do I got anything in here do I got any Jason in here I don't uh npm manette all right there we go they're like how many times does this appear hold on what are we looking for I'm just like yo yo dog that's a yikes do I have a do I have vs code yeah I have vs code cuz I tried it for a week straight I did VSS code for a week straight just like a couple months ago I understand that's V dude I understand the difference between VSS code and visual studio I'm just saying the fact that people will open up an Editor to search inside of a file crazy okay that's the crazy thing okay that's what this is like to edit a config file and you use that it's crazy crazy I did all my uh Graphics programming in Visual Studio Express it was Express so it was it was faster and this is much I think intellig waiting for intell indexing this is intellig indexing okay the amount of time I've spent waiting for intellig to index only for you to reinstall node modules and then re wait for intellig [Music] indexing do you really use [Music] [Music] Vim skill this is like the greatest skill issue I've ever seen in my lifetime what do you mean it's really really simp Le okay it's command motion command then you can also have count before the command and count before the motion and if you do a count before the motion it could execute the command again so like okay hold on I said that wrong so if you do it's command command to like do DD but then if you do number command command it still does that but you can also do command number command but if you do command number motion then it applies the previous command it's like that simple like here's a good example let's just say you want to highlight this paragraph you do V for visual your command then you do around paragraph see it's like that easy you can do uh you can do like d d to delete or you can do like D2D to delete two or you can do D1 J to delete two like it's that easy it's that simple it's that easy say you want to yank it you can Yap you can Dap You can undo you can you can redo you can cut and start typing you can delete you're not typing how do you guys not know this you can VI squirly brace to highlight within the squirly brace you can V you can v v oh my goodness VA squirly brace to highlight that plus the squirrly brace then hit it with the shift V to go into visual line mode now you have the whole thing and then you can yank it I could have done something different I could have done uh let's see GV I could have done uh ad D notice that what I did is I did GV to actually highlight my previous highlight in case I wanted to do something different GV stands for previous highlight how do you guys not know these things they're like super simple and straightforward okay I goes into insert mode at the current cursor a goes forward one capital I goes to the beginning capital A goes to the end skill issues why you guys have so many skill issues okay you can shift and you can G question you can G question mark to do a little rot 13 like have you guys ever needed to do rot 13 well there you go you just rot 13 okay sometimes you want to do a little rot 13 sometimes you just want to rotate some characters I just rotated some quick characters you know what I mean just a little quick character rotation not a big deal whatever you wouldn't understand you wouldn't understand you probably even have a girlfriend [Music] ridiculous oh no oh no oh no real talk press one in the chat if you paid for Sublime one in the chat if you paid for Sublime type 69 in the chat if you saw that box pop up 1 million times 69 in the chat if you saw that box pop up 1 million times o exposed oh the exposure is so painful isn't it if You' use it on Windows youd get the window sound too so if you're listening to music it'd be just like and it just like blow your ears out just the worst gedit users notepad++ users twitch has really relaxed their policy on nudity recently okay this is Artistic sausages okay this is Artistic sages right now FIB user out learning for FIB was that me was that just me I have a really good idea for a short chilling bro Visual Studio is actually a good ID he uses visual or vs code screw Adam D I still remember using Adam and I'm like oh man they're saying they're the most the first hackable editor meanwhile Vim has been around forever but I was like okay I would love to learn how to program using JavaScript okay this was during my JavaScript Max Max maximal days okay right when it came out okay just don't blame me okay I didn't know I didn't know what I was doing I was still still young I had too much hope all right and I open up Adam and I look at my first plugin and it was coffee script and I was like oh what what are the chances I saw coffee script haven't seen that in a decade that's funny I close down that one and I go to the next one coffee script again what are the chances that can't be right I go look at some official documentation coffee script what Adam went with coffee script what what that's like getting a Yahoo mailing address today Yahoo mailing address Yahoo email today you
