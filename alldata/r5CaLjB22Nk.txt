ladies and gentlemen welcome to a pilot of a brand new show i'm launching before i tell you the title of it let me tell you great ideas don't come from the vacuum from the void it's a great myth you know uh uh artists like myself that sounds so pretty artists we steal great artists steal guys but unlike what kevin david thinks you don't steal from one thing you take from a variety of sources so let me explain my inspiration for the show before we get into the first episode inspiration number one sociopaths sitting out there waiting to give you their money are you gonna take it are you man enough to take it that's one of my favorite scenes of all time second comedians in cars getting coffee i'll explain and this is comedians in cars getting coffee right it's catchy it's you gotta admit for such a long time it's pretty catchy so i thought i was cooking up in the brain you know i was looking around like is anyone gonna see anyone stolen this idea already look new show instituted right now sociopaths on stage selling ponzies kind of got a ring to it don't you think and look guys yeah maybe it's a pilot maybe we kick it off as a series maybe netflix buys it i don't know pump the stock that's all i look are we worried about fundamentals here are we pumping the stock what are we doing here now this is our boy today this is uh sociopath number one now guys you know guys i'm not a clinical psychologist sociologist i'm not a doctor i don't play one on the internet i do jokingly give my opinion on people okay you're about to get sold on a pretty amazing idea imagine let me paint the picture for you free money easy money guaranteed money can't lose can't miss money all with the power of imagination actually sorry the internet the internet with the power of the internet kin and his wife carrie cortwright want to buy you or build you a profit generating website that can make you up to 20 of your money every year like clockwork i've done guarantees in a contract uh which goes in perpetuity from as low as 11 i've even done one as high as i think 23 24 oh wow and that's not if it's successful that's guaranteed and in fact they said that if they don't meet their side of the bargain they will literally remake the store for you so when crap happens we enact what's called the act of god clause which is in the contract of our arrangement and it simply says it does not matter the reason that this site is failing it is failing so we're just going to set it aside and build or buy a new one and so on 18 times we have put up brand new sites at on at our dime and away they go do a minimum monthly guarantee of x amount so that it's comfortable for them to deal in a territory typically unknown which is websites making money personal minimum guarantees yikes guys nothing in life is for sure except for death and taxes well actually taxes some people have figured out a way out of that like logan paul going to puerto rico but anyways if you sign up now ken and kerry courtright will not only give you a guaranteed return they'll actually raise it by a few percent if you sign up right now you'll work with bill he'll add one to two percent onto the guaranteed minimum return that you receive each month it's pretty cool pretty cool guys guaranteed no risk which is pretty cool uh monthly revenue commitments go with all sites uh they might be as low as seven percent they might be highest in some cases depending on the platform and what we're building you might get into the mid sometimes even the upper teens yeah guys that means you put in 100k let me translate this they will give you up to seven to like 20 return are you hearing this there is no such thing as a free lunch but uh as you know in life if you promise things people will believe you and as such ken and kerry courtright have managed to persuade about 75 million dollars away from investors they say they're so professional don't they look trustworthy guys they just look like a couple of class acts they wouldn't lie to you he looks like a little boy scout leader or something like that he looks like he could be your state senator what are you not gonna trust this guy well as you've already seen this pitch is pretty slick but sociopaths or or people doing bad things they have cracks appear in their speech see if you can spot them in order to in order to to eventually retire you need to have a pile of money you see that ken he's a bit uh obsessed with how he looks on stage and he really doesn't like his wife who seems to not be as good on stage as ken and so during this speech he's constantly monitoring her controlling her and it's kind of weird but he knows in order to in order to true so of course he does it once all right so this is actually one of my favorite because well it's my opportunity to brag a little bit okay my opportunity and then again and then again nuts when your friend co-worker or neighbor who's not i understand who's not happy honey you've got to make sure the mic is close to your mouth while we pitch this ponzi scheme listen when you say guaranteed returns you got to put the mic close to your mouth she's like i understand you psychopath you put me up there all good things must come to an end and the sec brought the hammer down these two have been accused of operating a ponzi like scheme under the name of the income store in exchange for an investor's upfront fee they claimed they'd be able to build this website and of course they were not in fact they were funding their lifestyle with the returns from investors and with the money from investors according to some estimates of over half of the money will never be returned to the investors which is extremely sad because it was over 75 million dollars at the same time guys let this be a lesson to everyone these psychopaths will always be out here dressed in new clothes right have you ever heard the expression wolf in sheep's clothing that's the feeling i get like my skin crawls it's like they portray this image of oh we're just we're just family loving people right uh in reality they're greedy they stole old people's money i mean they stole everybody's money and it's absolutely disgusting the way they stand up there portraying themselves to be the good guys they're the heroes right that want to help you i mean i really want you guys to pay attention to how these two talk they talk like they've descended out of heaven above to help you out it's unbelievable okay so guys with that can you just give the listeners a little bit more about your background and what got you to where you are today yeah so we uh we actually started about 30 years ago came out of college we met in college and we just had a crazy idea that we could walk into business donors and tell them that we could grow their business and they should pay us that didn't go too well the first year but over time through a few testimonials uh we did talk a few people into letting us attempt to grow their business and turned out we were successful so uh but in 2009 uh something happened and that was where we came face to face with the fact that the internet is real it's not a fad it's here to stay and we think it should be the centerpiece of growth for most companies moving forward so we changed our growth consulting model and made a statement that we will only grow a business or a household by adding a money making website to them so it allowed for a second third fourth some even have a seventh eighth ninth revenue stream on top of their main in revenue stream and so we either build them or buy them a website that makes money and then our 200 employees manage it for them for a share of the revenues incredible because in actuality none of that was happening i mean i know for a fact that they did try to buy some websites and they were not successful they were not making the returns they said they were making and they instead were living out this nice life of sending their kids to private schools buying expensive houses all so they could just tell everybody we're we're living the life we can help you too and it was all a complete lie so what can we learn from all this well true passive income which is the holy grail of what most people think they need is actually very hard to come by and you should be immediately suspicious of anyone who promises you any kind of guaranteed returns in perpetuity it doesn't exist folks it's like the perpetual energy machine it's been promised year after year after year decade after decade as long as mankind has been around and it's always been a farce i've done guarantees in a contract which goes in perpetuity from as low as 11 i've even done one as high as i think 23 24 oh wow listen to that that is the most psychopathic thing you could say either that guy is the dumbest person on the planet or he is um negligent to a level that is unbelievable and he does face these charges from the sec at this point and it looks like he will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and i think he deserves it but remember when you look at these guys on stage they don't look like conman unless you i mean unless you look think this type of couple looks like common maybe they do to you but to most people they look like your typical middle-of-the-income road joes that just want to help you out they're well-dressed professionals who are stealing your money right under your nose so i'm glad it looks like the income store is shut down for good and i can only hope that people stop falling for these things let this be a lesson guys that's why i do the scammer history is so that you can watch these and not get scammed in the future because these have been happening forever so thank you so much for watching i hope you learned something hope you took something away don't fall for the perpetual money machine and i will see you guys tomorrow
