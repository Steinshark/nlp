what's up guys today we're gonna be talking about what's up guys today we're gonna be talking about how much money youtubers make I see comments about YouTube money all the time and most people have no idea what they're talking about so the question I see asked the most is how much do youtubers make per view well instead of just making up a random number we're actually going to take a look at my analytics I'm going to pick one day we're gonna see how many views I got and how much money I made off those views that way you know the numbers I'm telling you are actually real so I picked the day from last month and on that day I got 240,000 views and made around six hundred and sixty-nine dollars basically if you do the math that means every thousand views I got around two dollars and seventy cents so I want you to remember that number that every thousand views is two dollars and seventy cents because that's not just a number I made up that straight out of my analytics and we're going to use that to see how much these big youtubers are making so if every youtuber made what I made per thousand views that means in the last 30 days nine youtubers have made over a million dollars in just the last 30 days PewDiePie has 13 billion billion with the BEA views and if he made two dollars and seventy cents per thousand views that means over the lifespan of his channel he's made 35 million dollars even better a channel called Ryan toy review has over 6 billion views which means he's potentially made over 16 million dollars off of reviewing toys what's up guys beast toy reviews here and today we're reviewing this toy Karambit as you'll see it's uh can I just get the 16 million dollars and guys it keeps getting better most big youtubers make an additional six figures offer brand deals and sponsorships and to prove that that's true here's the deal that I was offered an app which I'm not going to name offered me $400 to do a video on it and then an additional 50 cents for every one of you that downloaded the app basically if I had done a video on that app I would have got $400 and then lots of you would have downloaded it probably would have got another like seven eight hundred dollars so I've easily could have made a thousand dollars just by doing a video on an app now in case you're wondering why I didn't take the deal well basically I downloaded the app it's one of those out where you download other apps you get points you trade those points in for gift cards I downloaded it I spent hours trying to get points I could not get enough points for a gift card to me the app was just a complete scam I don't want to scam all the people that watch my videos so that's why I didn't review it but just to put that in perspective if I could potentially make a thousand dollars off of one video off of just you know the sponsorship or brand deal part of it think about channels 10 times my size channels with one and a half million subscribers how much these companies would offer them they would literally toss thousands of dollars at them for just one video so anyways I don't want to ramble on too much if you see a video with 1 million views they probably made around two thousand dollars if it had you know sponsorship or a brand deal or something they probably made a couple hundred to a couple thousand depending on their size and yeah that's the video make sure you like make sure you subscribe this is an iPad I just dropped the iPad why is the outro not playing Oh Oh
