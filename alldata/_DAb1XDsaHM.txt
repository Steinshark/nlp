a lot of you probably know about Tinder and if you study computer science you definitely know about Tinder if you don't know what Tinder is congrats you're not a loser it's an app where instead of talking to people you look at their faces and then say yes or no by swiping left or right it's an app that turned love into a game you've got people catfishing ghosting saying they're 6 foot when they're really 56 kind of yucky right so what if we take Tinder and turn the concept of swiping left or right into something pure wholesome something that genuinely makes a difference and I think I know what fits that description adopting pets honestly we don't deserve pets they don't care about what you do they always give you unconditional love and loyalty they love you for you and all they ask in return is a bit of food some scratches behind the ear and the occasional belly rub which is why today we're creating a Tinder app but for adopting pets because pets are the ones who are truly looking for love companionship and home just imagine for a moment a world where every swipe on your phone could mean a second chance for an animal where Brad from accounting is replaced by Dilly the cap whose only life goals include a loving home a cozy bed and maybe your leftover chicken but how do we bring such a vision to life let's dive into the road map okay our first step for this app is getting some data on pets this is an essential part of our project since in order to create an app that's about adopting pets we need data on pets that need to be adopted we're going to need detailed information like the pet's name their age the breed the personality traits their health status and of course their adorable photos and videos once we have that data we'll save it inside a database the next step is to make the pet data we collected usable this is where step two comes into place our backend and API now for those of you who don't code the backend is basically everything you don't see on the website or app and it's usually used for manipulating the data we have in our database so in our case it's going to give us all the information we need about the pets but it only gives that information to the back end the back end now needs a way to send that information to our website and app this is where our API comes in an API stands for an application programming interface and it's going to act as the bridge between our back end and our website and app and now for our final step to display the data and let people use it the actual app and website so this is the most straightforward part the goal is to make it accessible and easy to use I want it so easy that even your grandma who doesn't have email can use this to adopt a pet now that you know the road map let's get started with step one getting the pet data but how exactly do we get this data this is where web scraping comes in it's a technique used to extract large amounts of data from websites automatically so in our case we're going to use web scraping to extract pet data from a bunch of different websites the good thing about web scraping is that it keeps our information up to date without having to speak with shelters or organizations which is great because I'm shy and awkward so by regularly SC scraping data from shelters and rescue organization websites our website and nap will have the most upto-date information about available pets because our database is going to keep getting updated with new pets now ideally in the future it probably would be better to talk to the shelters and organizations like a regular human being but no at the end of the day the goal is pet adoption and we're here to make sure they get a home so how do we start web scraping well it's actually pretty easy but the big problem is that whenever we web scrape it's technically a bot and a lot of websites don't like bots so they have Security checks like blocking your IP address or you know those captas where you have to select the squares that have a crosswalk and you don't know if the small little pieces count yeah those and luckily for us this is where bright data comes in bright data is going to allow us to web scrape the information we need responsibly and efficiently without worrying about these issues because they have their own special tool called the scraping browser and it gives us a lot of built-in features like solving those annoying captas and proxy networks to prevent our IP addresses from being blocked or banned bright data is an amazing tool and they were kind enough to sponsor this video and Supply me with free credits to use and if you use my link in the description you'll get $10 in credit for your own project but there's another problem I don't know how to web scrape with bright data so I'm going to learn how to do that real quick using their [Music] documentation wow that was uh really quick check out how easy it is to use bright data yeah yeah that one line right there upgrades our Normy weak browser to a gigachad scraping browser it's pretty cool let's start getting some pet data so I'm going to be using the website petfinder.com because it has information of pets from a lot of shelters and organizations so I'm going to start writing the code to scrape the data and then save it the code for this is pretty straightforward it basically has two parts scraping the data and then saving it the database I'm using is convex because of the nice features it has I'm not sponsored but I'm just saying a SP sponsorship wouldn't hurt comvex if you get anyways the program scrapes the pet data by collecting the links we get and it's going to take us to the Pet's profile page once it's on the profile page it's going to extract the Pet's information and once it grabs that data it's going to save it into our database currently we can't save the videos just because I'm being lazy but so far the process is pretty simple we can definitely make some improvements to it for now let's move on to step two in our road map our backend and API and it's going to be really simple for now where I just get a few animals okay this is actually going to be an interesting process since I want to make two applications a web app and a mobile app I thought it'd be a perfect time to learn turbo repo if you want to know more then read the docks luckily for us convex has a turbo repo example I'm still not sponsored well you know who is sponsoring right data baby Link in the description for $10 credit all right so I thought about starting with the mobile app and uh making an app takes forever and it's really hard yeah it have to learn a lot and during my research I learned that having a Google developer account costs $25 but that's nothing when you compare it to Apple's Price look at this oh my goodness why for what there's no reason for that now I understand why every app has ads or premium stuff because why do I need to pay $99 a year to upload some app so uh I'm going to work on the mobile app in the future maybe for another video but for now let's focus on the web version before we start coding I want to make a design inigma because I'd rather mess it up here than mess it up in code [Music] okay so I finished the rough draft of how I want this to look now does it look good I mean I'm a programmer not a designer okay leave me alone I also came up with the name for the we an app we're going to call it perfect you know because you're trying to find the perfect pet clever I know now that we have this design we can start coding yeah I wanted to get started with the swiping feature and check out how easy it is to do these animations with framer motion it just takes these small changes to take this to this it's pretty cool okay so I thought the swiping animation was going to be simple but like most programming problems it's not to me wait I'm supposed to be working on the back end whoops okay so I made some progress on the back end again I kind of forgot to record it my bad it's pretty simple so far just grabbing pets and an unexpected challenge was actually the swiping I didn't think about it but the website needs a way to remember what pet you swiped on because if you don't have that then the website's going to keep giving you the same pets and the same thing for the undo if anyone can please let me know if there's a better way of handling the swipes I'm not the most experienced I'm pretty stupid so I would greatly appreciate if anyone would let me know hi I'm terrible at this a lot of progress has made got myself authentication so you can log in log out I got this cool little sidebar and the swiping feature is looking pretty good you can swipe it with your mouse swipe it with the buttons and you can swipe with your keyboard I got the images working for the pets so you can view each of their images it was pretty annoying to code the backend code for this is pretty questionable I'm definitely going to fix it up a bit more but I do have this annoying bug right now whenever you swipe on a card and you refresh the page that pet is still going to show up for like a quick second and then it just leaves I'm going to see if I can fix it but other than that this is looking pretty good actually so I'll see you when I remember to record hello this idiot sloth forgot to record again bro only had one job let's speedrun the features first we got ourselves the pet profile page amazing next we got loading States wow so exciting and lastly sloth managed to fix the stupid card bug hooray now for the big questions will sloth ever finish this project is he going to pay Apple $99 a year is he even going to make the mobile app will he remember to record his progress is he ever going to fix his skill issues find out next time on sloth's silly Adventures [Music] we
