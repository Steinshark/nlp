ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar studio let me say up top this investigation will contain potential money laundering unregulated offshore gambling and worst of all influencers this is a million dollar video i just realized i spent 600 000 on watches i lost two hundred thousand dollars to six nine sixty thousand in private planes twenty thousand on hotels in mexico a hundred thousand rolex in cars yeah it feels good to be a winner this is the first in a six-part series in collaboration with some ordinary gamers exposing the secret world of unregulated offshore crypto gambling and how influencers have become filthy rich by being the gasoline on the fire promoting it around the world and making it into the billion dollar phenomenon it is globally now i'll be honest when i first started looking at this i had no idea about any of that the reason i'm actually here starts off the way all great stories start with twitter beef alright here's how this went down i had been hearing for a while about how online unregulated crypto casinos were hiring some of the biggest influencers in the world to promote them and then would pay them for every fan they got to sign up and not only that every time their fans would lose money to the casino the influencer would make a cut on those losses now i thought this was insane and i said enough's enough it's time to act so i tweeted about it quote just found out that the top gambling streamers are getting paid a percentage of their signups losses so not only are streamers getting paid to promote gambling to their fans they're literally incentivized for their fans to lose as much as possible how do these people sleep at night now normally i expect my tweets to go into the great void of jack's armpit but this time i guess one of those gambling streamers actually saw it and he responded steve will do it now i can't imagine why he felt singled out by my tweet but he was pissed off that i would accuse him of profiting off the losses of his fans he told me hey you broke [ __ ] do your research rubette's affiliate program has nothing to do with losing it's about the bet rhubat is different than other gambling websites do your research you broke [ __ ] before you post like this publicly given his thoughtful response i thought hey maybe i made a mistake so i went back and checked rubet's affiliate terms and it turns out he's right grubet doesn't give influencers a percentage of their fans losses rubeck gives their influencers a percentage of the mathematical odds of their fans losing this is straight from rubet's page affiliates receive a commission of five percent of the mathematical house edge on all their referrals wagers with that percentage increasing as the referrer climbs the tiers and if you're thinking right now wow that sounds like basically exactly the same thing it is the exact same thing just with a little ethical distancing it's kind of clever actually because now instead of being directly tied to their fans losses they complete innocent they're still profiting from their fans but you know in that indirect economic percentage sort of way it's kind of like saying no i didn't bomb those syrian kids i just sent the drone the dead it's the exact same thing it just sounds a little bit better but anyways we fired back and forth a few times he eventually deleted his responses but something he said always stuck with me and no it wasn't the part about him sleeping very well at night living in a penthouse knowing that i change people's lives every day and i'm rich it wasn't even hey you broke loser it was actually this do your research which is why this series now exists and steve will do it legally can't be mad about it because technically he's the one who asked for this so um yeah steve this one's for you now i want to be clear ladies and gentlemen a small sense of vindictiveness is not why i'm telling you this story today it is a small reason okay i'll admit that but it would have never carried me through this investigation which had so many dead ends what actually hooked me and kept me going on this investigation was a single question how is this video possible it shouldn't exist now explain what i mean let's go to the board because i gotta explain a little more about steve will do it for a little context steve is a member of nelk an insanely popular youtube channel known for their pranks like trying to use monopoly money at a casino kind of weird foreshadowing to be honest but they generally make fun popular videos with a lot of money being thrown around cars being gifted partying that kind of thing but the money i was seeing thrown around specifically in stephen dewitt's videos was too much it didn't make any sense like every video it was private jets buying exotic cars giving away hundreds of thousands of dollars and going off my experience with youtube i knew something was off see remember that video i mentioned the million dollar one it only had 4.3 million views and in that video he really does spend a million dollars this is a million dollar video i just realized by contrast the only other youtuber in the world i know of that can afford that kind of spending is mr beast who regularly gets 50 plus million views on a video and there's always a sponsor on those videos to recoup some of that cost but here's the weird thing on steve's video with 10 times fewer views there's no sponsor and that's how so many of his videos are he's throwing around money like mr beast but he has a fraction of the views and he's not sponsored so it begs the question where is this massive cash flow coming from is steve will do it the son of assadi prince like this dude seems to have endless amounts of cash oil barren amounts of cash and at first i thought okay wait a second happy dad their new alcohol company right but it can't be that because this spending predates that well maybe it's merch then that's the nelk boys thing right they pull in 70 million dollars a year selling their merch maybe selling hats is how steve affords to live like the son of a president and i would have thought that but right as i was about to give up someone gave me a helping hand on a drunken live stream let's let's bring down the board here i've figured out other ways to make money so i don't i'm not big because i feel like a baller right now i don't take private planes i don't buy three hundred thousand dollar watches i don't buy whatever but today i just bought a two hundred thousand dollar sprayer badass i can't i don't do that i'm selling t-shirts dude it's actually impossible i've figured out like i've gotten financial advice this and that from my two buddies they've helped me out so it's like they own wizards so it's like they've helped me make so much money to wear to where i don't even want anything wow when i saw this i thought to myself is this guy confessing he talks about getting financial advice from someone that changed his life like from who who who is it steve help us is it warren buffett did you get advice from max kaiser i mean honestly from the way he's talking whatever this magical financial advice is it dwarfs nelk's merch business i can't i don't do that you're selling t-shirts it's actually impossible so what is this financial secret what is this knowledge immediately i started hunting around at first i couldn't find much just more evidence that steve will do it of all people is more loaded than possibly any other youtuber in the world right now just watch this answer to a question about finances from stevo's podcast what is your mission to be a billionaire gonna be a billionaire all right to be a billionaire yeah do you have a timeline for that three to five years three to five years damn what wait a second three to five years he's not even saying that ironically or is it drug he's like yeah what three to five years i don't know i mean whatever secret way he's talking about making money earlier the kind of wealth that's impossible selling merch that must be what we're missing here the missing link and i wasn't making much progress finding out how he was doing it i realized i had to focus up i gotta set my ego aside i gotta make a change [Music] there we go i'm finally ready what happened next was kind of hard to stomach i spent the next several days watching enough steve will do it content to make my eyes bleed but finally all my work paid off i finally found the episode where steve once again mentions his friend who made him so much money alfonso has helped me a lot you know with some financial [ __ ] like making good financial moves money moves i'm forever grateful for him and i'm gonna gift him a richard mill okay so you need he has a bunch of richard mills this one's like a it's like a unique one okay so we actually learned something here one this alfonso guy steve's special friend who helped him he must be loaded right because if he has a collection of richard mill watches that regularly cost hundreds of thousands of dollars individually a collection would mean he's at least worth several million dollars minimum now at this point i'm imagining several different possible candidates for this mentor of steve's obviously tai lopez being the first one but i was completely wrong the financial wizard behind the curtain is shockingly young so this is alfonso yeah wait this guy he looks like your average frat bro in his mid-20s but even as that was like breaking my brain things started to make even less sense pay attention to what he calls alfonso just a bit later in this clip i'm gonna let it play for a bit and this is doom 100 of the time 365 days of the year he wears a full send slash steve will do it slash happy dad shirt and allen knight whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa did you catch that he calls him ellen and he does it again later too alan again huh why would steve will do it miss label his friend to find out i called up a friend of mine who's been digging into this the third eye himself because we need to get to the bottom of who this mystery man is phillian thanks so much for taking the time i know you've been looking into this who is this alfonso guy or alan whoever it is all right so i tracked it all down his name is alan he's a 25 year old multi-millionaire running the los angeles social media scene he owns both rubette and wizza you know roubaid right yeah it's that online casino that steve will do it and all those guys are gambling on right exactly except it's offshore unregulated cryptocurrency based and it's not legal in the us and they are raking in tens of millions of dollars per month oh my gosh wait a second you're saying alan owns that along with whizza as well yup those are some big accusations how do you know it's this like frat bro behind it all he doesn't have his name on it right well he does have rubet's name on himself he's quite literally got a tattoo of it on his wrist which he showcases above his richard mill you know the 500 000 watches you know all the one that all the 25 year olds own yeah yeah i mean i got two of them but uh i got them also on the transitive property of aiden ross wait you got what do you mean you got a clip for that or something of course let's roll it this house is sponsored by uh a company called like wizards i'm sure i haven't paid rent at all but i could do and if you guys can you guys could literally help me come up with giveaways like challenges and like like last person to blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah like i can literally promote how i want to do it how we want to do it you guys can help me decide like yo ayden you should do a giveaway where you're doing this they're actually really cool dudes bro and they're just like me like they own rubet they own that site right not only that rubet's rocket fund llc is also registered to the exact same address as the wiza sweepstakes llc which is 930 washington avenue suite 205 miami 33139 holy sh it is the same guys so when steve will do it's talking about his friend who owns wiza helping him out financially in in life he's talking about reubet yup he's talking about allen and not only that this guy allen used to be part of the cs go gambling scene back in the day under the name arrow 1738 until he shut down his youtube channel with 40 000 subscribers and now since then he's tried to stay in the dark it's the same scam all over again exactly all right i know that's been a lot so we're going to recap real quick so steve will do it is like insanely loaded because of this guy whose name is alfonso but not alfonso because that's actually an alias his name is alan and he owns a sketchy giveaway company called whizza but also rubet which is an online gambling casino which obviously gives us some context to why steve will do it as defending roubette so hard on twitter this is his golden goose this is where his money is coming from in fact remember that one million dollar video i think we finally have the answer to that it may not have been sponsored but watching it again there definitely was a sponsor in that video this is definitely our guy he's the reason for this lavish spending but i also realized that this story might be bigger than just steve yes he's loaded and i'm determined to find out how much money he's making from getting his fans to gamble at offshore unregulated casinos but there are many other influencers also promoting rubet you've got nelk aiden ross logan paul's friend banks and you also got whizza how does that play into this this sketchy giveaway company and what about alfonso there's just so much here i think i got to make a call honestly all right mood i'm passing this off to you we need to do more research about rubet how does it work how do you get paid what's going on with all these la influencers oh brother i'm already on it look at the sky look at the stuff i already found wait what what the hell is this kangaroo while he's heist why do you want me to do that howie you're [ __ ] weird as [ __ ] bro [Music] things will be different if i was balling
