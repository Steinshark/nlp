[Music] hello everyone and welcome we are sitting inside of the new porsche 911 gt3 we've got dry weather we've got a nice road so today is a good day so porsche gt3 let's start with the engine i do have a video going into great detail about this engine so i'd recommend checking that out but it is a 4 liter naturally aspirated boxer 6 cylinder engine producing 502 horsepower at about 8 400 rpm revs all the way to 9000 rpm and peak torque 346 pound feet now if you do look at the engine's torque curve there's a noticeable bump around 5000 rpm but you do have pretty useful power throughout the rev range but from 5000 rpm to 9000 rpm you really can start to pick up some speed quite quickly and i do love a good naturally aspirated engine i mean you just feel like you have so much better response with naturally aspirated engines versus today's turbocharged engines where wherever you put your foot on that throttle pedal you actually get a difference right instead of a turbo where you kind of wait and then it shows up and it's not quite what you were expecting this the throttle pedal tuning very good you get exactly what you ask for and you know you're very connected to it because it's naturally aspirated there's nothing all that complicated going on right there's max there's minimum and the reaction time to getting that max torque versus minimum is very quick moving on to the transmission this is using a seven speed porsche pdk so dual clutch transmission you can also get an optional six-speed manual transmission so how fantastic is that i don't really think there's cars of this caliber offering manual transmissions anymore i think there's an aston martin that does it uh maybe the lotus evora but really in a car of this category you know that's the martin's a bit different more of a gt cruiser than you know something that can really attack a track like this gt3 cars of this caliper they're not offering manual transmissions anymore and that's a shame and there is actually a benefit to doing the manual transmission in this car so not only is it 37 pounds lighter so that's definitely a benefit versus the pdk but it also has a slightly higher top speed so with the manual 198 miles per hour versus with the pdk 197 miles per hour so if you were to have a drag race uh that was infinitely long because of course of course the the pdk is going to have the advantage off the line but if that drag strip were long enough eventually the manual transmission would catch up even though it's slower to shift and slower to launch uh zero to 60 for the manual transmission is a bit lower versus the pdk because the shifts in this are just so exceptionally quick uh but regardless very very cool that porsche is still offering a manual transmission in a vehicle like this now you may notice that with the new 911s they have an eight speed pdk and a seven speed manual transmission so why does this have one less gear in each well it's using the old gt3 transmissions and there's a good reason for that weight savings so the seven speed is actually 44 pounds lighter uh than the 992's eight speed dual clutch transmission so a significant weight savings by using the old transmission and honestly i don't think you'll miss that extra gear i think this transmission is fantastic the shift speeds are exceptional as you would predict and it's a very good transmission well spaced out for the gearing and the speeds that you're allowed to get i always like you know more aggressive gearing than what porsche does but i think with the pdk here the gearing spacing is pretty good now this gt3 is a larger car uh so you know it's about 1.9 inches wider than the previous gt3 so it's bigger right so that means it weighs more right well it's actually only 11 pounds heavier than the previous generation whether you go with the manual or whether you go with the dual clutch and porsche has put a big emphasis on weight reduction okay so listen to some of the efforts here to removing weight from the vehicle removing the rear seats takes out 22 pounds an optional carbon fiber roof can remove two pounds reduction in sound deadening versus the 992 pulls out 4.2 pounds a thinner liner behind the seats removes 2.6 pounds carbon bucket seats can pull out 33 pounds porsche ceramic composite brakes pull out 39 pounds versus the standard brakes versus the previous gt3 10.4 pounds have been removed by lightweight glass 5.5 pounds from the front fascia and hood 1.1 pounds from the rear fascia three pounds from the front wheels even though they are wider and 22 pounds from the lightweight stainless steel exhaust engine revisions and revised engine mounts have pulled out 16.7 pounds and 7.7 pounds respectively and there's now a lithium ion battery that pulls out 22 pounds versus the gt3 which is centrally mounted behind the front hood so overall the curb weight and especially considering you know this is a naturally aspirated engine producing a healthy amount of power curb weights are really good now what about aerodynamics so this is also quite improved over the previous generation gt3 so in all the standard positions this has 50 percent more downforce and has an adjustable diffuser up front as well as the adjustable wing in the back so there's four different positions you can put that wing and if you put it in the most aggressive positions front and back then you're getting a hundred and fifty percent more downforce than the previous gt3 about 850 pounds of downforce so what is this thing like to drive well uh for the most part it's genuinely fantastic you know the steering feel is fairly light but it's very responsive we're on michelin cup tires so you know plenty of grip there plenty of response from those tires does exactly what you ask of it nice weighting to it as you build into the corner there and you know the feedback i was just coming out of a mclaren 620r and that was about feeling absolutely every tiny little detail of the road i feel like in this it's a bit less uh as far as feeling all those tiny little high frequency vibrations uh but it certainly feels fantastic like i don't have anything to complain about um and and possibly i think there's probably some drivers of when i was in that mclaren 620r that would say you know what this thing uh the steering's a bit rough because they provide you every tiny little piece of detail which can be good or bad i mean it's certainly good to have communication to the driver right one of the things i really like about the porsche 911 gt3 experience is that yes you're in this crazy capable car but it feels like a very useful usable car like the visibility and this is really good you've got a fairly low cowl you've got this dash fairly low so you've got really good front visibility great visibility out the sides good visibility out the wing except for the fact that you know if you look in your rear view mirror that wing is dead center in the rear view mirror so yeah you can still see behind it but it is right in the middle you also have a ton of cargo space i've got two carry-on bags uh in the front and then behind me there's so much space i mean it's it's pretty impressive actually how useful this is of course you've got the rear seats deleted which helps take out that weight and you've got plenty of useful space back there so i like that it's maintained as a useful space even though you've got a big engine back there too right four liter six cylinder engine back there and yet you still have all this space uh for practical use so it's actually a very practical vehicle doesn't crush you on visibility like many of the cars in this price range will do they'll say you know what rearward visibility you don't need that we're going to get rid of all of it this gives you good visibility all around which is kind of rare in this segment and i really like that i feel like people are like oh we've got sensors we've got cameras you know we don't need all this like crazy good visibility but from a driver's perspective it lets you see and feel the environment around you and i appreciate that about this car now as far as the suspension this is the first time in a road going 911 that they're actually using a double wishbone suspension and porsche says this gives them better control of the camber throughout that range the suspension travel range so increasing grip as you have you know that variation in where your tire is at based on the suspension travel also with the suspension you have all kinds of adjustment right so you can adjust the damping uh you can adjust the toe the camber you can dial that in uh to what you would like you also have front nose lift so if you're driving around town you don't want that nose really close to the ground so you can get over you know speed bump or whatever it is low curb uh then you can raise up the front and that's gps enabled so to remember those spots and in the rear you have rear wheel steering and porsche says they incorporate it a little bit differently within the gt3 than within the standard 911s and so there's a bit of a middle ground instead of being you know below this speed the wheels are opposite and aid with maneuverability and above this speed you know they they both turn together so it aids with stability at those higher speeds there's kind of a middle ground with the gt3 where you know it's very uh situation dependent on which way it will choose once you're above a certain speed but also below a certain speed so there's a bit more variation in the rear wheel steering sometimes i find rear wheel steering can be a little off-putting it feels a little strange because the rear end is doing something and it might feel like the rear end slipping i never get that sensation with this car so the way they have set it up i really do appreciate i think they've done a nice job uh keeping it feeling very natural now as far as the wheels and brakes so this is the first time on the 911 gt3 they're actually doing staggered wheels so 20 inch wheels up front 21 inch wheels in the back and one of the things that i found interesting they said about this and why they chose to go with the larger diameter wheel in the back is that it helped with their wet stability so they wanted to put a bit more tire on the back and they went with this 21 inch wheel but in doing so in widening that tire's width then they had a problem with wet traction and so they said going to the 21 inch wheel help them with the new porsche wet mode which is aiding in stability when you run into water they said that this new wheel combination with the 21s in the back helped elongate that contact patch and improve the wet traction the brakes used are absolutely massive they're the same diameter as the brakes used on the 911 turbo they are a bit thinner so they're about 17 percent lighter than on the 911 turbo one of the interesting things they do is instead of drilling all the way through they have these countersunk uh little dimples put into the standard rotors and so part of it is that by reducing the material by using a thinner uh brake rotor you know obviously it doesn't have quite the same strength as what's being used on the 911 turbo and so instead of drilling all the way through they have these dimples that can help clean those brake pads uh but don't go all the way through to maintain some of the structural rigidity the strength of that brake rotor now the car we are on is using the ceramic composite brakes so this pulls out about 40 pounds of unsprung weight so if you go back to the curb weights for this thing the manual um you know being like 31 26 pounds if you you know take out the go for the optional carbon ceramics uh optional roof optional seats you know there's another 70 to 80 pounds you can pull out three seat options these are the carbon bucket seats to pull out about 33 pounds so looking at those curb weights uh you can pull another 70 to 80 pounds out of those uh with certain options and the car that we're in right now i mean yeah porsche options can get crazy but this car is under 200 000 with those options so it's got the optional brakes it's got the optional seats pulling out you know another 70 to 80 pounds uh which is fantastic i mean the the joy in driving is highly rewarded when a vehicle's weight is down and this does a very good job of that while still maintaining actually a rather nice interior so like yeah it's got the thinner glass and you'll notice that on the highway the wind noise but the interior itself very solid i haven't had rattles in this thing it's been a very pleasant experience to be inside and it's like yeah you could daily this thing if you really wanted to there's nothing wrong with it it's a nice experience being inside of this vehicle so overall i think i usually get a bit cynical when it comes to cars in this price range with the question of like is it worth it right and certainly that's kind of a relative question but is it worth it is something i i often don't think is necessarily the case when you get into cars of this price range uh and that is not how i feel about this thing i i mean it's just it's genuinely fantastic the first time i drove a 911 gt3 was back to back with a ferrari 458 and this was before i'd really driven many vehicles and i was biased towards ferrari i absolutely loved ferrari at the time and that was my first time driving when i thought this is going to be the best experience ever i'm going to love the ferrari gt3 and whatever and i drove them back to back and i came out loving the gt3 and being like as far as the ferrari the gt3 is just an exceptional car and you know yeah are there cars you can get more than 500 horsepower in this price range sure but you look at the weight you look at the responsiveness you look at the character of like how this thing drives the dynamics of it and it's also good and yet so daily drivable livable um practical you've got useful space you've got good visibility it's very difficult to fault this thing now that said this is a pre-production model um so not everything has been perfectly worked out and in this case there is a check engine light so there's my one fault it has a check engine light still uh seems to drive just fine with it on um i think that's like kind of part of being in the volkswagen family but overall love this car thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave them below
