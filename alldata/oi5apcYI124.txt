ladies and gentlemen in every single sport there is a feverish debate for who the greatest player of all time is and ultimately it comes down to multiple choices across multiple Generations the game of chess is no different the three names associated with goat status and chess are Bobby fiser Gary Kasparov and Magnus Carlson until now there is a man so dangerous and so powerful and he is completely destroying every single person in his path to get to the ultimate title of course I'm talking about the one and only Tyler one Tyler one is a League of Legends streamer he is a powerlifter and a bodybuilder and he is the greatest chess Prodigy known to humankind Tyler 1 in July of 2023 was rated 199 and probably even lower than that and yesterday March 18th 2024 eight months later including a three-month layoff when he retired from the game he is now 1,700 and he is now better than 99% of chess players on the planet and in this video I'm going to take you through several of his games that he played recently to recross 1500 cross 1600 beat the highest ever player he's ever he is beating an 1800 level player in less than about 6 months consistently of play since July of 2023 he has played over 6,000 games of Chess and he has done 12,000 puzzles Where Have You Been now the opening that Tyler employs is called the this is called the cow opening now that it's just it's not really historically known as the cow opening but it has been popularized by the one and only Ana cramling chess player and streamer from Sweden and on chess.com this is now just called the cow the reason it's called The Cow nobody really truly Ever Knows this is the way Tyler one plays all his games Bishop to B4 all right we're going to analyze every one of these games how he beats a 1500 and gets all the way up to 1705 including a win over the highest rate of players ever beaten in 18 25 he beaten 1825 okay here we go he plays his cow Bishop before plays Knight G3 trying to Target the bishop one of the benefits of the cow is the knights are kind of like slingshots they can go after Bishops that get too close here black plays a move that you couldn't pay me money to play which is ah my Bishop is under attack well better give up the other one for absolutely zero reason Bishop takes D2 no disrespect to chess rock and rolla but that is a dreadful move and I always say this in my videos if you cannot explain why you are trading a bishop for a knight you should not do it you should not do it there is no need to do this a bishop is better than a knight unless you're going to trade put a bunch of Pawns on the color of the square that the bishop was the dark Square bishop or if the Knight was protecting something or you're going to damage pawns you did none of that and now Tyler just has a very comfortable Advantage black plays the move F6 what black should be doing here is developing and castling black plays F6 Tyler plays A3 and H3 I guess a cow is supposed to have horns kind of or maybe not maybe that's a bull buffalo I don't know that unicorn I don't know but he plays A3 H3 to prevent the knight from coming there and to prevent the Bishop from going to G4 I guess black plays this Tyler plays Bishop C3 one thing about Tyler's gameplay by the way is he's very like he's slow and steady with it he's methodical he massages the position okay Knight E7 Queen D2 you'll notice every move he plays is is up a rank and he is very good with his clock management he doesn't spend a whole bunch of time he plays moves that are solid straightforward you know we're not going to get into the intricacies of like well you know this move maybe you don't play because your Bishop gets BL no he just he's a simple man opponent castles he castles he has 940 on the clock he has a 1 minute time Advantage he is very frequently putting his opponents under some form of clock pressure black plays H5 great move trying to go after the Tyler in in in 2 seconds just says no you can't do that Bishop F7 now Tyler plays Bishop B5 all right improves the positioning of his Bishop pins the Knight to the queen black plays G5 that's just a blunder that's just a blunder and even at 1500 this is just purely ACC counting exercise it's two things for white now Tyler's he he doesn't need that Tyler had a followup ready for Bishop B5 which was Bishop B4 so now he's got the Bishops bulldozing the black position he's going to take on E7 then he's going to take on C6 he's going to open up the king and he does exactly that he literally goes through that plan without even hesitating Rook he he's actually here if he just pauses for a second but he goes Bishop E7 Rook to E1 and then he just slowly brings the queen trades and plays Queen A5 and the queen is now a menacing piece on that side of the board he's playing this position like Magnus Okay Tyler Carlson Magnus whatever Tyler's last name is Queen F4 check Queen D2 look at that look at that move he was like I'm getting forked I don't want to get forked so now I'm going to bring my Queen back we're going to trade and we're going to play this end game he takes the Knight and the two Rooks versus the 1500 he has a three and a half minute time advantage that's a very big deal he's very fast but he's fast but not bad which is a tough balance to strike Pawn takes bad move that's not a good move because you're splitting the pawns with black all right we don't want to trade for no reason now we're just giving Tyler targets right look Rook H1 an even you know maybe stronger move Rook E6 they're about the same Rook H1 Rook f8 he just picks the pawn up immediately goes for the weakness doesn't even go below 7 Minutes Bishop H7 black is down to a minute and 30 on the clock at this point Tyler could put on a chicken suit and dance around and he could win shout out to the gentleman great show on Netflix night not sponsored by the way KN of four now Tyler just has to not move he literally can just not move because black can't move black can't move his Rooks so all white has to do is just March down here and he's going to win the bishop Tyler plays a bit more forcefully not a fan of this but only because black has 29 seconds on the clock like stall your opponent out instead absolute pandemonium happens here and um Tyler accidentally blunders but black only has 17 seconds and now black just proceeds not to take this pawn something very HP funny happens here some sort of Witchcraft is cast and black just doesn't ever take the pawn on F2 and then proceeds to just lose because of the queen what a game I mean that was just a very like that was just a methodical Beatdown of a 1500 he really didn't make any blunder he didn't punish his opponent as much as he could have but he just goes to this end game and he was never worse I mean literally he played like 50 moves against the 1500 and at the worst he was equal and he was up 6 minutes on the clock I mean it's unbelievable he's so fast and he really doesn't make any really bad mistakes now this was by the way this was like a day later if not like 12 hours later he plays all the time here his opponent I don't know has like diarrhea brain so they play F6 completely fine I'm really confused by the way how black is named King Chaz but the username is a Jay cuzz I there is not a single Jay in Black's username maybe he smokes one before he plays a game I don't know anyway Jay Knight to E2 we see Tyler you know back to the true and tried black playing A6 the thing is people cor 1500 they can't punish the cow effectively the cow opening is is only bad you know if if you play as aggressively as possible like for example Knight F6 Knight E2 and then you start playing like H5 H4 you know you you you disallow White but it's a little too meta and by the time we get out of the opening you know Tyler is completely fine now I don't Tyler once again by the way going for an end game looking for a queen trade and and trying to get a position where he has a lead in development because he's you know he's Magnus basically black plays D4 closing the position white plays Bishop E2 just kind of a very off balance very complicated game we have takes takes Bishop B7 and watch this Tyler look at this positional genius this absolute Savant of the game black has 1 2 3 4 five out of seven pawns on dark squares which means the dark squares are strong which means the light squares are weak which means the light squar Bishop should be traded to make the light squares exploitable Bishop to F3 what a genius Knight C6 now look at Tyler Bishop H5 check it lost all the advantage but it was a brilliant move um he he should have just castled but he's trying to induce his opponent to make pawn moves and weaken the position not the best but we'll take it Bishop D2 long castles and now you can take the Knight and Advance over here and that's what Tyler saw now black here should have taken with the queen you take with the queen you threaten the pawn that's very unpleasant instead of that they did this and now actually Bishop A5 is cooking but Tyler puts the Knight there instead fine and takes and so now he he's got to do something over here like if I'm playing with white here I'm going to I'm going to try to create an attack bring my Rook right so he plants the bishop on the A5 Square Rook to D7 and in this game he has met somebody who is playing equally with him on the clock because as you go up the rating ladder people get better at chest shocker Pawn takes D4 opening up the position any way that black takes Tyler's going to do something okay so there we go Queen G4 a slightly better move would have been to potentially threaten a rook infiltration first and now very instructive the best move here for white is B4 tearing open the position black will probably take because if you don't take I'm going to take you or push and I actually give away the second Pawn this is super instructive you go down two pawns but Rook B1 Queen B3 is an Unstoppable attack on the black king that is actually like the most instructive way to create opposite side attacking chances what happens in this game is black creates this barrier right and Tyler plays F4 and black is about to lose um if black moves the bishop there's Rook E8 King B7 and I'll probably bring in the queen and black is really really suffocating but here black plays the only move the only move that doesn't immediately lose and actually the only move that actually it it not it not only doesn't lose it puts white under a considerable amount of pressure and here is one of the rare cases in chess that I always say about eight times out of 10 in chess the best move is going forward sometimes you can't go forward you go forward in this position you're going to lose the game Tyler goes forward and unfortunately now not only can the bishop save itself it can replace where the pawn used to stand and Tyler is just down a queen he's just going to lose a queen a lot of people would resign here a lot of people would get mad maybe Tyler did get mad gives a check sacrifices the queen because that's the best he's going to get if the Knight takes you actually take the Rook but and now Rook e one he doubles black plays H5 to try to kick out the the position Tyler immediately goes after the queen gives a check all he can do go for the king go for the queen doubles up again black gets the Knight out Bishop B6 King B7 he grabs a pawn now if I'm playing Black here I'm going to play Rook E8 I'm going to try to trade the Rooks I'm just going to try to trade the Rooks I got to trade as many pieces as I can but black is a little bit nervous here so he goes after the bishop instead Rook B6 chck Tyler goes after the and you would not believe it this man because he was down a queen but because he kept giving checks he didn't give up he kept creating chances for for for himself his opponent walks into a discovered attack and Tyler takes the Knight with a check he loses the bishop but he gets the queen and now he defends the pawn and he has a knight and a pawn for a rook he is still worse but he is not losing he was losing now he's worse Black plays D3 immediately the pawn gets swed immediately Tyler repositions the Knight look at this backwards knight move in five seconds he finds Knight to F1 in 5 seconds Knight F1 is crazy and by the time the Knight arrives in the middle the advantage for black is gone and black panics which Tyler doesn't do Rook takes Pawn takes and Tyler is just winning in the Rook end game he is winning in the Rook end game it's unbelievable Rook E4 he says no thank you you can't have my Pawn Rook D4 King E3 and black simply cannot do math and by that I mean you do not trade the Rooks in this position ever in a million years you are down 5 to four you cannot play 5 to four you just can't it's not possible in hockey you can five on four basketball the five would win 99% of the time Rook takes D3 you just can't do this this is a completely losing end game because not only that but also White's King is closer to the middle and my man Tyler prevents the king from getting in this is do you A3 is ridiculous so many people would go here and basically just like hope and pray and maybe it works maybe it works but there's going to be positions that it doesn't work and Tyler methodical Tyler Carlson plays A3 and walks the the king in and it took black a detour and by the time black starts taking pawns Tyler walk the king so many of you would have gotten tunnel vision and just taken the third Pawn he knows time is of the essence and this man gets the queen stops white from advancing takes on H5 gets the win cross the 1600 Tyler Carlson and I'm telling you guys that was against 1500s this man beat an 1825 rated player you see there the 11 points down from the uh from the defeat he was 1825 before that and he plays the exact same way with black which is utterly ridiculous because white is supposed to have an advantage like the cow with black is worse than the cow with white all right Bishop C4 Knight to G6 Knight to D7 White playing very solidly by the way very bad move here I'm just going to say for an 1800 sorry no disrespect eigor you got to take as much of the center as possible if your opponent is giving you two Pawns in the center we got to go back to the golden moves you have to take the center D3 Bishop E7 castles castles this time we have a short Castle cow all right we've had a few of these but this time we have a short Castle cow all right H3 A5 all right fascinating Tyler spent one second on that move clearly understanding something about the cow that we do not white plays Knight to H2 no amount of money would help me expain this move to you it's just not possible Knight to B6 Knight to B6 targets the bishop on the C4 Square Bishop A2 King h8 the idea of King h8 is to get off this diagonal that is a dank move Tyler is now dabbling in what we call prophylaxis which is a word that's too long for you to understand but prophylaxis means in anticipation of anything negative in chess it's a prophylactic move and now he wants to play F5 and TI is a genius because not only did he want to play F5 he knew the opponent would want to move the F Pawn and he would strike it back E5 now this is just a free Pawn but that's why Tyler's 6098 he's you know he's not 80 he's not 9861 yet he closes the center so he locks the center the Knight is blocked the bishop is blocked the Knight is blocked the bishop is let's see what happens D4 locks the center even more not not the best move C5 would have been better but fine let's see what happens how do how do how do these two Geniuses of Chess maneuver in a close position Knight to E2 Queen to E8 Bishop developing Here Comes Knight to H4 now is there anything that is going to happen after the move G3 the answer is no the Knight just has to back up now white continues to make improving moves Tyler decides to jump out to that side of the board the problem is the same thing can happen it doesn't but it could have B5 taking a little bit of space and now the Knight backs up Knight also goes to G1 slow maneuvering game at some point the sides are going to clash Bishop A6 look at that look at B4 oh Tyler striking he has been he is the first to land on the shores of his opponent's position looking for a pawn trade that could transform the game Knight to F3 now in comes the Knight oh boy targeting the bishop white gets rid of the bishop Tyler takes with the bishop now we have take we have take white plays a four now th this is a high level move from Tyler A4 protected by the queen and Tyler as a followup to his light squared infiltration cuts the communication of the white position with B3 and now is threatening Rook takes A4 we have Knight to D2 the pawn is taken the pawn is also taken there now sensing that the board is opening up on this side of the board we have Queen to B8 immediately putting some pressure white plays Knight to C5 which is a good move Tyler takes thinking that he's going to get dc5 but unfortunately Knight C5 was also a threat on the rook and suddenly he has blundered just like in the previous game all right half human half everything else Bishop to D3 okay the bishop is hanging but the Rook is hanging The Rook moves now before he moves the dark squ Bishop out of the way he drives the bishop into E4 this is going to be a menace of a piece look at it just like a light house in the white position Knight Bishop goes back to E7 the Knight goes to F3 Bishop goes to E7 white begins picking up pawns here here Tyler plays the best move Queen B3 hits the bishop hits The Rook The Rook has to defend the bishop it doesn't white blunders white Under the pressure of all of this instead of playing rookie one and staying calm plays Queen C3 Tyler was putting pressure on the clock as well he was up a minute Queen takes D1 now Tyler is up a knight versus an 1800 rated player and now it's about cleanup now a move I would not play here I would be a little bit more patient I'll play Rook here I would also make sure I never get M it I just want to play H6 no back rank checkmates then I bring my Rook he goes here fine you want to simplify but that Bishop was better than that Knight was better than that Knight now white is going to defend but okay he gets the queen out and he is winning Rook to B2 now again I would play Rook B8 or Rook A8 I would also stop myself from getting mated Rook B8 is a good move Bishop D2 and now the second that he noticed the Rook Queen e oh that's bad that's real bad for white the queen is in there Queen C4 professional move looking for a queen trade and now white hangs this and now Queen B6 Queen B7 he wins The Pawn on B4 as well Queen to A2 and this man do you know what move he played in this position the move he played in this position with the bishop unable to move because the Rook would take the cleenish bishop E1 what a spot he spotted that move in 2.3 seconds 2.3 seconds he spotted that move and now he wins The Rook Queen B1 in with this and now it's just a sequence of checks until M check check block this move prized the king away and it is a methodical check made until the end he plays like seven top engine moves to clutch the win versus the 1800 that is absurd that was a very very good game it had a blunder as chess games do all right it had a blunder and then he immediately I mean that the the bishop plant in the center was nasty and white clearly felt the pressure immediately blundered this and I mean this was methodical understanding he could trade the Queens winning the pawns and I mean that's just Bishop E1 is a ridiculous move like what a spot I mean it it's it's it's really weird to play such a move at at 1,700 like Edge I yeah and by the way that got him to 1698 so in the very next game he could have thrown it all away he could have not made it of course he got the the TR and tried right he go into the true and tried the patented black playing very principled the opponent from Greek Captain mango this game Tyler decides I'm going to strike in the center the opponent goes here keeping the tension very principal development Bishop B2 both sides Castle Queen D7 and now just like in the previous game we expand with the F Pawn we expand with the F Pawn and clearly black didn't like what was going on here now for black the best move for a while actually has been to probably take if you close the center F4 becomes a lot more powerful close the center this kind of transformation with a close Center and you know white being Rock Solid like this is very much what white wants um but F4 you almost never want to play when the center is openable because after takes takes even takes Bishop takes Bishop takes Rook takes like even this queen trade leaves you just with a bit of a weakness just a small like a but you know what fine and none of that even matters because in this position Rook d8 was played and it took Tyler 1.0 seconds to understand the secret idea of f4 is not just to open the center it's to trap the bishop and now he is completely winning after just 11 moves black overthought the situation black was like do I take do I take do I not take one do I take both what do I and then they overthought it Tyler has done 12,000 puzzles he traps the bishop he takes the bishop and in this position it would have been slightly more resilient for black to play this because actually then taking here is a little dangerous there's going to be various tricks it actually doesn't work this is check but Knight can take and then take the queen but it's a it's a trick I mean it's just there as a possibility none of that matters and yeah Tyler too I mean black goes for Bishop C5 anyway and just hangs the bishop 1669 Knight oh look this is hanging this is hanging Queen is hanging Knight is hanging a lot of you would have been like oh damn my queen is H you know I got to move you know I gotta KN the Knight gets out of five seconds instant instant Knight B4 he doesn't panic he gets the trade A3 setting up some various Bishop b4s gets the queen puts the Rook on the center line black plays C4 and the idea okay I just want you to understand how ridiculously good this man is at chess C4 has two threats the first threat of C4 is that if you take it there is a fork which is why by the way when Tyler puts the King on H1 remember the previous game like way in the opening Tyler played King h8 he just put the king out of the C yeah because he wants to move his F Pawn it's actually a pretty good idea to put the king in the corner but the idea of C4 is that if you take there is a fork furthermore there is Rook D2 so you're going to lose both Bishops if you take so how do you get out of this position well I'll give you an I'll give you a small hint something opened when black played C4 something opened every time a pawn moves every time any piece moves some squares are no longer covered some things are different than they once were when the pawn goes to C4 the dark squares open up Tyler in two seconds plays here two seconds the brain his brain has completely understood pattern recognition like the fact that he's already thinking how the pieces can interact with each other to SP that in two seconds is nuts because most people after C4 would think if I take this oh no okay he spots this and now that's covered the bishop can't be taken so now just very simple he takes and this is protected twice so you're not even losing The Rook black decides to trade all the pieces takes on4 and resigns black takes on e4 and blunders this or maybe that was just a rage move and resigned before Tyler can even Tyler is 1705 and the level that he is demonstrating in these games is crazy and he's doing it all without even playing real openings this is not a type of chess for everybody this man is unironically very good with pattern recognition like to spot moves like that just under just understanding the way positions change that fast crazy stuff I'm like actually super impressed there is not much else to say um yeah this man is 1700 uh everybody plateaus at different points he plateaued pretty hard at like 13,400 he took a break he played a lot of bullet he did some puzzles but he didn't play a lot of Rapid uh and um yeah what more to say I mean this dude is unbelievable admittedly I mean I think he's playing like 8 to 10 hours a day and he has the uh the time and obviously his job as a as a streamer makes life a little bit easier but that is absolutely no excuse for the rest of you y'all got to step your game up so that's all I have for you today get out of here
