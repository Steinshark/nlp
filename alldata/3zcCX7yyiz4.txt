who would believe that Intel is the bang for the buck King I know right but wait there's more with the release of the 13th gen raptorlike desktop CPUs they are also the gaming performance King making ryzen 7000s rain the shortest in recent memory which productivity thing shut up oh oh there's a lot of meat to dig into here and whatever you might think I promise you this video isn't sponsored by Intel because it's sponsored by build Redux build Redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides and competitive pricing compared to building a PC yourself just go to build redux.com Linus to start your new build today while AMD kicked off this generation with some big platform changes Intel's remained on their LGA 1700 socket where they've had a solid year behind the scenes to refine their hybrid architecture on a relatively mature platform by now which isn't to say they aren't bringing some big gains first up is the improvements to their Intel 7 manufacturing process which contributed to a massive bump in core counts compared to last generation both the 13900k and the 13600k got double the number of efficiency or e-cors and the entire lineup saw big bumps in ondi cash which is great for workloads like keeming yeah and they boosted up clock speeds too on that note the next big Improvement is to memory compatibility Intel has moved from official support for paltry ddr5 4800 all the way up to ddr5 5600 with XMP extending that to a whopping 7200 Mega transfer per second and that is out of the box from talking with memory manufacturers we are expecting to see even faster memory kits in the future that could benefit from raptor like second generation ddr5 controller their updated z790 chipset has some tricks up its sleeve as well giving 13th gen chips access to more PCI Express Gen 4 lanes for high-speed storage and additional USB 20 gigabit per second ports but that's not the best thing about it to be honest the best thing about it is you don't have to buy it 13th gen CPUs are backwards compatible with 600 series motherboards after a bios update and they're compatible with ddr4 memory dramatically reducing the overall platform costs for upgraders making Intel the value play this generation but only if it has the performance to keep up with AMD so how fast is it to help each platform to put its best foot forward we paired them with the best kits of ram as recommended by each manufacturer we also updated our bench to the brand new and beastly RTX 4090 so say bye bye to bottlenecks and hello to some spicy numbers my goodness at 1080p which we used for most of our benchmarking to amplify CPU bottlenecks we saw AMD rip out of the gate with a narrow win in CS go but I mean with the top three CPUs all bottlenecked it's not really a meaningful win notable here though is the 13600k leading the last gen flagship 12900k could this be a trend well in Total War the 13600k ends up lagging behind the 12900k but only slightly and matches the performance of both ryzen 9 CPUs the 13900k tops the chart here but frankly the most notable thing is just how far behind the ryzen 5 5600x is and it only Falls further behind in Far Cry 6 where Intel gains their first big win topping the chart with a 12 lead in average frame rates but also big wins across the board in our minimums the game is just more stable on Intel and in Hitman 3 it just feels like we've been playing through the same graphs over and over again trying to find different ways to kill AMD Factory building game Factoria I mean while guzzles L3 cash like a frat boy on spring break allowing AMD to dominate the next four games were tested at three resolutions 1080P 1440p and 4K let's start with our old friend Tomb Raider at 1080p the 5800x 3D finally shows us what we know it can do and while it's very much amd's game with their 7600x keeping a sizable Gap over the 13600k it's the 13 900k that takes the cake moving up to 1440p the rankings stay pretty much identical and at 4K we hit a brick wall where the GPU is clearly bottlenecking and all the CPUs are performing within error this is actually something we've seen in all of our 4K games today and actually most of our 1440p tests too so if you were wondering why we don't test CPUs at resolutions higher than 1080p it's because results tend to be fuzzy at best and generally inconclusive we could lower our graphic settings but in the past we've shown that that reduces strain on memory and consequently the processor which will ironically make the tests even more CPU bound and a CPU can be bound for your couch with our couch pillow at ltdstore.com anyway let's get back to 1080P and stay there in Tiny Tina's wonderlands we see a tight race with barely a 10 difference in frame rates between the 7950x and the last gen 12600k only the 5600x lags behind in any significant way and it's nearly the same story when we look at Forza Horizon 5 only narrow victories to be had there photo finishes I guess cyberpunk though yeah cyberpunk it's a bit of a mess organizing our graph by average FPS puts to 13 600k at the top but when you look at the minimums it's the 13 900k that is the clear winner in a few of our charts we see the 7600x outperforming the higher clocked cached and cord 7900x and we think this is likely due to some am5 teething issues it appears that in some workloads the chips with two ccds may be underperforming this was noted by Hardware unboxed and cyberpunk might be one of those workloads I suppose maybe AMD will fix it but that is in the future and we want performance now so where do these results put us the gaming king is dead long live the gaming King more short-lived depending on your perspective when we compare the average performance of all of our CPUs to the 7950x we see the 13900k dominating with approximately five percent improved frame rates across the board and the 13600k Falls squarely in the as good as the 12900k category alongside the ryzen nines and it beats out its price competitor the 7600x thanks to more stable performance but look at this what happened to everyone's favorite ryzen 7 5800x3d it was so dominant in previous benchmarks that even Intel played koi in their performance graphs from their announcement well we have a couple of theories here one the games we use for this review didn't benefit As Much from the extra V cash it's a possibility two and this is the big one like physically big the RTX 4090 when we compare these numbers against the ones from a ryzen 7000 review we see that the 7000 series have much improved frame rates but the 5800 X 3D it doesn't budge it appears that the extra GPU horsepower was what we needed to demonstrate the 5800x3d's upper limits and the 5800x 3DS Fall From Grace continues in our productivity benchmarks in cinebench the 13900k just cracks the 40 000 Mark and multi-threaded with a healthy lead over AMD just across the board the 13600k gets a lot of its extra efficiency cores showing up the competing mid-range CPUs by a wide margin and actually surpassing the 12 700k despite the lower number of performance cores and in single threaded performance the 13900k whips out nearly 2 300 points that's 10 percent more than the 7950x meanwhile the 13600k is not much faster than the 7600x so it's leaning more on its ecors in y cruncher which uses the fasts available algorithm for each chip Intel actually takes an L by not supporting their own AVX 512 extensions but they manage a win in the handbraking code where the 3900k handily beats out the 7950x and the av-1 software encode and the 13600k is no slack either beating out its price competitor 7600x by 40 percent and breathing down the neck of the significantly more expensive 7900x when compiling chromium the 7950x is abundance of full fat cores continues to win in such heavily parallelized workloads so it's strong showing in blender is again expected but Intel is sure giving them a run for their money v-ray again is still very much amd's game at least in the high end the 13600k is making the 7600x look pretty irrelevant at this point in the single threaded flacking code amd's really high clocks can only do so much against Intel's better instructions per clock moving on in Spec workstation the 1300k steals the crown in every situation except for finance and while the 13600k can't keep up with the 12900k as well as did in gaming it still offers a lot more performance than the 7600x for just 20 extra dollars it also beats the more expensive 7700x while we didn't test that CPU today compared to the results from a ryzen 7000 review we see that the 7700x loses in nearly every category at the end of the work day Intel wins again they beat Andy's Flagship and while the victory is small the difference in price is massive the 13900k undercuts the 7950x by a hundred and ten dollars nearly 16 percent and by providing 15 more performance at a mere 40 premium over the 7900x that squashes that cpu's performance at its current price point taking the performance and the value Crown oh Intel stop you can only win so hard hey what you use expensive Ram that's not fair I only have Chief ddr4 will these CPUs be any good for me to answer your rudely asked question we ran some tests again on ddr4 and using cheap jet XP ddr5 expect a deep dive regarding Ram speeds in the future but for today if you're on ddr4 our comparably fast kit on the 13600k and spec workstation C's performance remain virtually unchanged in most CPU workloads there were only a few notable drops and in the couple of games we tested we saw little to no difference okay well what about slower ddr5 well in the tests we ran on our 13900k we saw typically performance drops of about five percent on the lower kit if we saw anything one thing I hope to see is if intel has managed to get their heat and power issues in check uh in our F1 thermal tests we see the 13900k running at about 10 degrees hotter than its last gen counterpart but as AMD has shown us if you have thermal Headroom why not use it and pin the performance core is to full Boost right and in prime95 the 250 watt CPU managed to spike as high as 350 Watts so you need to make sure that you get a beefy cooler nhd15 from noctua is the minimum that I would recommend the 13900k skyrockets to 100 degrees Celsius before dialing back the clocks from their all-core boost Target and settling in at about 90 degrees as for the 13600k well it's still managed well by the nhd15 staying 10 degrees shy of throttling and keeping clocks pinned at Max boost it is pulling 60 more watts and running 15 degrees hotter than its last gen counterpart though but this is a worst case scenario so they like power but can they wield it responsibly Intel claimed that when running the 13900k at 65 Watts we could expect performance that is on par with the 12900k at 241 Watts while the efficiency improvements they've made on this gen are impressive it seems that the Bold claim with a lengthy post script is not quite true 40 percent worse performance in handbrake and that's more of a double bogey than a par but looking at spec workstation the improvements to efficiency are more in line with Intel's claims overall Intel has managed to make some big improvements to their CPUs without increasing power budgets like AMD although In fairness Intel's power Bunch was already and still is Sky High and they are doing better numbers at a better price remember the 13900k meets or beats the 7950x in almost all workloads for 110 dollars less now I understand that a few of you might be feeling a bit sad with your already aging ryzen 5 5600x but remember these three things at 1080p in most games performance differences will be imperceptible because a lot of these games are already running faster than most monitors can refresh and a lot of the performance differences in our charts are only exposed when the chips are run alongside a sixteen hundred dollar GPU as much as it feels bad man to see your three-year-old CPU getting bodied by these new Chips the year over year performance improvements that we are seeing thanks to this renewed competition feel pretty damn good your next upgrade will be worth it almost as worth it as our sponsor Zoho won if you run a business you know how hard it is to keep everything
