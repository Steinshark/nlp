to start with I'm going to talk about why these things that we call mobile phones aren't really mobile I've got one in my pocket right now they are definitely mobile so what do you mean so if you look at the design of most mobile phones most smartphone applications it's all designed so that when you use them you kind of look down at them you tap away with your fingers every time you actually interact with this device you're supposed to stop have a look at it you touch the screen so it's kind of I I guess I call this stop to interact there are some good apps out there I mean I've used driver and runke keeper and some of these apps that are developed for people who are running around or on bike rides and they seem to be pretty good I mean you go for a run with run keeper and it tells you what your pace is you know how fast you going all this sort of stuff and you can get them to give you directions and all sorts yeah so yeah there are good examples of these apps very good examp of design for it particularly when you're looking at designing for very specific situations or when you're looking for Designing for situations that aren't too extreme um if you look at a lot of these apps so if you look at run keeper for example almost all the interaction is done when you're stopped things really break down once people start actually wanting to interact back with a system in any way other than running a little bit faster or slower I do a lot of sports I'd say if there's a real benefit to to doing physical activity to doing exercise to running around to moving to cycling what I'm arguing for here is the design of what I call interaction in motion so how can you design systems which which are usable while you are performing some kind of locomotion so while you were while you were cycling while you're driving while you're running while you're even while you're swimming while you're skydiving just anything really you've always got two things happening here is a person and moving in some we I'll call that The Locomotion there's a song come to mind here Jo I'm going to tell not to sing it so they're doing some kind of movement they're running their cycling or whatever but at the same time they're doing some kind of interactive activity with a piece of technology on this diagram we have two axes the inhibition so how much does your movement inhibit the inter ability to interact so if you're walking that would be kind of somewhere down here it wouldn't be very much it would be low so walking would be kind of somewhere down here as you went up so if you started running it's much harder actually to interact with devices if you run then if you look at more extreme things if you're say if you were rock climbing it could be really hard the kind of most difficult thing that I can think of to build systems for is swimming if you're trying to interact with a device while you're swimming pretty much everything is stopped everything is blocked your legs are always behind you your body is always flat a lot of the time you have to kind of move your arms in particular patterns so your your arms have to be in particular places so you can't use those very much um you really can only see a tiny bit of space just in front of your eyes um you can't use speech recognition interfaces because your mouth is underwater and there's often actually a lot of noise so even if you use headphones it's actually very hard to hear with all the kind of splashing going on so swimming just really strongly kind of inhibits what you can do from a design point of view looking at this bottom axis here I have what's the relation between our two tasks so we've got our movement activity which is you know walking or whatever we've also got the interactive task so how related are these if you think about a smartwatch if you've got a smartwatch a lot of the things that does it kind of shows you notification so it says you know somebody sent you an email so if you're using a smartwatch while you're running along that's not really related at all you know so your Smartwatch would be right over here somewhere whereas if you're using something like a satav in a car that's kind of directly relates to how you're moving it kind of responds to how you're moving where you're going and so that's really strongly related beyond that you have systems which actually kind of really encourage your movement so if you look at exercise systems there's these things called exertion games they will say now go faster now go go slower they're really just they're making REM movement activity happen with these two axes how might you design for interaction in motion I'm going to split this into four quadrants here in this corner we're designing essentially General solutions for things so movement that's going on isn't really related to what the interaction is so it's you know thises things like smart watches Google Glass that kind of thing you know it's just you know maybe it's just showing you notifications or something notifications you but as well as that we're not expecting people to do anything too extreme the solutions for this might be pretty basic stuff like make the buttons a little little bit bigger or use speech interfaces if you're if you're doing things where speech is going to be possible so this area is roughly the limit of what most kind of mainstream design is for I'm going to talk about this area next when you're talking about quite extreme activities so like swimming or skydiving or something like that so something pretty intense that takes a lot of your concentration takes a lot of your physical ability away and if you're designing something that's strongly related to that activity you can really kind of tailor solutions for um for the for a specific activity for example there are a couple of interactive systems for swimming which um which basically focus on a single problem which is the kind of key problem of swimming outdoors in races is swimming in a straight line they are specialized into interfaces that they kind of detect is someone swimming in a straight line and say okay now you should be going to the right a bit and show you a little light in your goggles so you can see it there are specific camera triggers that you can buy for skydiving which actually sit inside your mouth because that's the only interaction surface you can kind of reliably control in this corner you've got your movement activity is something that has a lot of inhibitions you're saying okay I'd like to design something for that kind of situation but I'd like it to be you know let people do things that aren't really related to the situation so read their emails or whatever slightly dramatically I call this the danger zone the most common way to design for this situation currently is if you look at driving and you know driving and Saabs it's the same example the most common way to design for this is actually to enforce people stopping to interact so a lot of saavs won't let you interact with them their turn off their controls while you're moving there are some other ways which are sort of starting to come in in cars with touch screens you can't look at a touchscreen it's hard to hard to um it's hard to touch controls but um various people have been looking at using gestures on touch screens like if you use three fingers and you slide it down that changes with volume if you use two fingers and you slide it down maybe that does your air conditioning so ways of making these touchscreen interfaces possible to use without looking at them this is where it's really hard and you really need to think is it worth doing should I just design my system so people stop in this corner we've got things which are strongly related to the movement but actually the movement you're doing isn't really constraining things is the design any different from over here what you can do with design here is is primarily kind of aesthetic things as a kind of interesting example of that um there's a game by um Niantic Labs which is called Ingress and in that you have to kind of go to places in real life to sort of capture they call them portals so you capture kind of energy in in real places and there's kind of thousands of people around the world playing this but at no point do you actually really need to run fast or drive or anything at the same time so um actually their interface really it's just kind of you know it's a classic kind of stop to interact interface but a really interesting thing about their interface is they've got this it's kind of like a scanner so it's like something out of Star Trek you're kind of Star Trek you'd kind of see people you know scanning people like that scanning things like that and Visually it's very much designed to fit in with that idea that this could be some kind of Star Trek type device this area I've called it flexible location based design because your interaction is quite strongly related to what the um what the person is doing in terms of moving but there aren't really many constraints on how they can interact is this just stuff that's evolved organically do you think do you think we need to put a lot more thought into this rather than just letting people just kind of build apps on the fly with no knowledge of what they're doing in user interface I think we could build better apps if we pay if people who were building apps paid attention to what people who are using apps actually do with them in real life in terms of moving your whole body twists about 50 to 60Â° and when you look at the magnetometer readings you get something that looks like this graph here you can see here it's still got slightly less still a bad idea is you take that password and you uh encrypt it so you
