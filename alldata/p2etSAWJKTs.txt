super mario 64. the name carries a heavy weight for so many people for millions it brings nostalgia reminding them of countless hours playing the game as a child given that it was the first 3d game of its kind it left people in awe given how innovative the gameplay was how creative the level design was and how comprehensive some of the maps were but mario 64 also has another legacy according to speedrun.com more speedruns have been completed of this game than any other game in history over 1 000 runs have been submitted beating out even ocarina of time and over the course of nearly 15 years this game has seen a lot incredible grinds so-called unbeatable runs and sheer dominance by a few players today we're going to look at the history of perhaps the most famous speedrun of all time super mario 64 120 star [Music] for those unfamiliar with the game under normal circumstances it's impossible to beat the game with less than 70 stars there's a staircase before the last level in the game that will loop repeatedly unless you have at least 70. there's technically a way to get by this and beat the game with far fewer than 70 stars but i'll get to that in a later video even though you normally only need 70 stars to beat the game there's a total of 120 stars that you can collect 120 star is like the 100 category since you're collecting every objective that you can and for most games the 100 category is typically less popular than any percent category which in this case is 70 star and while it is true that there are more 70 star runs than 120 star runs the runs that kept people coming back to watch more and the streamers that pulled over 10 000 viewers per stream were the ones that were playing 120 star the skill required to play this category is unbelievable there are precise jumps difficult inputs all over the place and tricks that look virtually impossible to pull off ninety percent of runs don't make it out of the first five minutes but whenever one does the viewers are treated to a real show the runner will go from world to world each one with a distinctive theme doing various challenges needed to get every star at the end of it all is perhaps the most stressful part the bowser fight you need to pick him up by the tail and throw him three times into three bombs ideally you get it three out of three times but unfortunately the window to make this work is only a few frames as a result oftentimes battles or ends up going wide right or wide left and each time he does it costs about 15 seconds another thing that should be noted is version differences in general speedruns of this game are played on the japanese version and a lot of that comes from the fact that in the japanese version peach doesn't read the letter out at the start but in the north american version she does which wastes a few seconds in addition the wii virtual console version of this game is technically faster to run for a speed run because of shorter loading times but these runs won't be covered as pretty much every world record runner this game does it on the original console finally one more thing to add even though this game is sold top to bottom with really difficult tricks there's far fewer glitches in this category and most the tricks are fairly straightforward they just require a well-timed jump or extremely precise movement so i'm not going to cover them all with great detail to start the first recorded 120 star speedrun was done way back in 2004 by a player named spiderman 88 mill and was nearly three hours long this run was not recorded in the greatest quality but that adds to its charm and really gives you a good idea of how long ago this run was done many of the strats are primitive compared to what is used today such as not jumping off of peach's slide to skip most of it and the execution isn't nearly as good either since he died in a few places but this run really showed the potential of the category had to entertain people nobody really messed with the run again until a couple of years later in 2006 when a player known as draghorn came along and cut nearly an hour off of the run many of the sloppy sections from the previous run were fixed but still the strategies were fairly basic one could possibly think of this as the first modern speedrun of 120 star because he had no deaths and finished the game in a much more reasonable time compared to the times that people get today and then for four years nobody ran the category perhaps was considered too daunting too difficult or just too much of a grind but finally in 2010 a japanese runner batora ran the category and was the first to beat it in under two hours this run was really impressive he came out of nowhere and pulled off so many incredible tricks and set a really difficult goal for anybody looking to beat him so once again nobody really tried for a while but a year later in 2011 irumo another japanese runner cut about 30 seconds off of the run and then three months later he did it again this time beating his own world record by nearly two minutes and became the first player to cut the 150 mark beating the game in 1 hour 49 minutes and 49 seconds this run was absolutely incredible at the time it very well might have been the most impressive speed run of any game ever accomplished there were so few mistakes so many tricks and even a few musical synchronizations for style [Music] [Applause] [Music] this run garnered quite a legacy amassing over 11 million views on youtube making it one of the most watched speedruns in history as it turns out the dominance of the japanese runners wasn't complete six months after romo's legendary run another japanese runner honey chopped a minute off of it finishing with a time of 148.50 this run got pretty popular too having 5 million views on youtube with all the views and popularity that 120 star was receiving at this point it was clear 120 star was on the forefront of the speed running scene and it seemed like japanese were on top of it all but a month after honey's run a small american twitch streamer and youtuber known as siglemik demolished it he got a 147.10 beating honey's record by 100 seconds and with this run he established himself as an amazing mario 64 runner this run really had it all and the way he did it wasn't anything too special he simply executed everything beautifully so once again people didn't challenge it for a while a year later though honey wanted revenge so he grinded and grinded trying to lower it down to a 146 and although he didn't quite make it he still did take it back from zalemic by 5 seconds in march of 2012 but while honey was grinding this run yet another japanese runner nero x2 was very quietly grinding along with him in the background 13 days after honey's run nero took it from an insane time 146.35 taking half a minute off the record sadly the video of this run seems to have disappeared from the internet so no footage of this run exists today by mid 2012 siglumix twitch channel had grown to be really massive people loved watching his mario 64 runs and his follower account reflected that in august of 2012 he made a challenge for himself he is going to play 120 star for 12 hours every day for a month trying to lower the record these streams really ushered in the growth of both siglumix channel and of speed running in general they pulled over ten thousand viewers easily people were really excited to see him run the game strangely unlike most popular streamers of the time signum stream had very minimal chat interaction he'd sometimes go for entire runs without saying a word but hardly anybody cared watching cigarette on world record pace was still riveting for the first few days in august he had a few close calls but no new records but on august 5th he broke through and beat the record by 12 seconds the twitch chat nearly exploded oh my god that was really the world record i died a lot thank you guys thank you sake wasn't done yet though two days later he lowered the record by another two seconds unfortunately though no video footage of this run exists either as the glimmic deleted most of his twitch highlights a while back so all their remains of this run is a screenshot meanwhile while solomonic had everyone's attention former world record holder honey wanted the record back and three days after the celemic lowered the record honey surprised everyone and lowered the record by 40 seconds since iglenic was still doing his 12 hour streams he was quickly able to get a chance to take it back and just three hours later that's exactly what he had done oh i didn't think i was to be able to with this run right now sake didn't beat up by a lot only six seconds but he had responded to getting his record taken in one of the most amazing ways ever after that month of august siglomach was one of the biggest names on twitch he continued his dominance over the game lowering the record by a few more seconds every few months these videos brought in hundreds of thousands of viewers and his twitch channel was gaining hundreds of followers every day when he finally did a face reveal at adq 2013 it was an exciting moment for all of his fans after having the record for over a year and a half he finally was able to achieve an amazing goal 143. damn that was sick and after that he slowly disappeared and it seemed like he couldn't be caught his runs were ahead of everyone else and they had been for a very long time but in early 2014 a new runner emerged puncheon he lowered his pb more and more until he was just 12 seconds away from celemic for a few months he kept playing and playing losing runs in tragic ways and in may his efforts finally paid off i [ __ ] did it [Music] puncation that knocked one of the most famous speedrunners from the game that had made him famous naturally he wondered how far he could push the game to he had already gotten a 143 so he figured maybe a 142 would be possible he got to work and over the course of several months lowered the time more and more but the 142 still eluded him finally in july he had a run way ahead easily on 142 pace but then no no dude why are you freaking kidding me he still did manage to close out the run but it was still 15 seconds from a 142. that's so depressing yeah that's a good time that a few days later he had another one go deep on a good pace it seemed like this one was going to beat the 142. it was coming down to the last few seconds no no dude why i had i had this choke like that he kept going and finally he had another chance he answered the last stage in the game and was extremely tense the whole time but he made it to the end and right before he is at the last pipe that's fall crap oh my gosh i swear i swear i can't believe this i cannot believe this right now a glitch which acted as if there was an invisible wall in front of him had messed him up three times in a row still going into the bowser fight there was still maybe a chance in getting 142. he did it throws as fast as he could that was it man that was 142. does anyone know what causes that i just lost 142 because the invis wall just got me three times [Music] these runs were incredibly discouraging and it takes a lot of persistence to keep going at times like this finally though a few days later he had one more shot at it uh he had done it puncation had reached an incredible goal he'd become the new siglemic the world record holder and the most popular category of the most popular speed game and had gotten a ridiculous time of 142. around this time famous glitch under sock folder helped figure out one of the most infamous tricks in the game canonless in womp's fortress there's a star called blast away the wall where you're supposed to get into a cannon and shoot into a wall breaking it off and revealing a star due to some glitchy hit detection though it's possible to clip into the wall and get to start without breaking the wall naturally this is what speeder arms would go for since it's much faster than hopping into the cannon unfortunately going for this trick was pretty much a complete crap shoot usually you would just run at the wall fall down and then reset mario 64 runners used to reset their runs here nearly every single time but sock folder figured out a way to almost always get the trick to work you need to grab onto the sludge backwards jump onto the plank punch once hang onto the side of the plank go back up and run at the wall if done correctly this sets mario up perfectly so that he can grab onto a ledge that isn't really there on the wall and collect the star this setup eliminated a ton of resets from the start of the run using this new setup function lowered the record even more over the following months ultimately getting a 1.4232 it seemed like puncation was going to be nearly impossible for anybody to top one day in february 2015 puncation had a 120 star race with former world record holder nero just for fun nero had his mic off for the race but he was in a skype call with the other racers at first it seemed like any normal race for nero with him falling behind his pb after a few splits but then he got gold split after gold split after gold split and all of a sudden everyone in the race realized that nero was incredibly on a world record pace run dude i'm i'm watching nero's run because he can get world record in this run darn i i might lose my world record tonight guys and out of nowhere nero closed out the run 15 seconds ahead of puncation's record so he was unexpectedly back on top this run got a lot of publicity with articles saying how he accidentally broke the mario 64 record but when he lowered it another six seconds a few months later it began to seem like less and less of an accident maybe he'd be there to stay for a while a month later though a new player came from nowhere to smash everyone's time cheese05 in april 2015 he got on a run that started out pretty good and then it got better and better and better somehow she's able to execute pretty much everything the exact way he wanted to and lowered the time all the way down to 1.4116 and just two weeks later he lowered it again this time to 141.112 [Music] i did it i did it dude and cheese both realized something the game was pretty close to being beaten in 139. if that was ever accomplished that would be huge since for years the 120 start tasks had been 139 so they both started grinding and went back and forth with the record my god i don't know how to throw this man [ __ ] yes i barely got it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [ __ ] yes [ __ ] yes [ __ ] dude [ __ ] eventually puncation was playing less and cheese was the one that kept improving the record he was so close to 139 just 12 seconds away and in november 2016 it seemed inevitable he was going to get it all he needed was a decent bowser fight even if he missed a throw he would still just barely be able to get a 139 but the pressure was [Applause] we enormous [Music] [Applause] [Applause] please [Applause] i can't do bother throws anymore i can't do them anymore sadly the 139 would have to wait she is grounded for a couple months after but wasn't quite able to finish off a run and as of today that's where the 120 star record stands this game sure has seen a lot whether it be the first vhs speed runs from nearly 15 years ago [Music] twelve hour per day grind from celemic the awesome races at gdq events are the insane heights of the categories that today even though nobody's gone on 139 yet it's inevitable that it will happen someday by somebody via cheese puncation maybe even somebody watching this video who decides to start running the game thanks for watching everyone see you next time [Music] you
