hello everyone and welcome in this video sponsored by Hankook we're getting some fascinating insight into what is arguably the most difficult Tire to create and that is the all-terrain tire so in terms of the various styles of truck and suv tires the all-terrain is a bit of a blend between a tire dedicated almost entirely for on-road driving which we have here and a tire dedicated almost entirely for off-road driving which we have here so why do I say this is the most difficult Tire to design well think about what you want in a tire you want it to be quiet you want it to be comfortable you want it to be durable so it doesn't get flats you want it to wear evenly and last for thousands and thousands and thousands of miles you want low rolling resistance to maximize fuel economy and efficiency okay then you have the grip factors so you want it to perform well on dry roads wet roads snow ice and so far we've basically described the ideal all-weather Tire which is already extraordinarily challenge changing to make basically do everything in every on-road driving situation really well but now we're adding on top of that all the off-road requirements so it needs to perform on dirt gravel rocks sand mud basically do everything on every surface possible and do it well oh and again maintain all of the already mentioned qualities of course durability is a huge challenge when driving on Sharp and irregular objects like rocks but hey it also has to have really good grip on dry roads oh and snow now I must mention these are not the original equipment tires for this Bronco but this is a great vehicle to showcase the capability of these tires and certainly a vehicle that can make the most out of all-terrain tires and with tires there's a huge range out there and that's because specialization is the name of the game it's much easier to make tires perform well for very specific scenarios but this tire the at2 extreme needs to do absolutely everything it's difficult to overstate how how challenging this is because you are forced to make compromises so let's Dive Right In starting with the most important part of any Tire the compound now if you think about it okay you've got summer compounds All Season compounds winter compounds as you might suspect this is most similar to an all-season compound as to accommodate a wide variety of use cases the difference though is that an all-terrain needs greater durability to hold up to off-road scenarios so the compound in this case is harder so you have a compound that can handle heavier loads as these tend to be used on heavier Vehicles your compound also has a higher tensile strength think about the tread blocks gripping a rock that block is stretching so it needs to have a good tensile strength it also needs to have better crack resistance so if the compound starts to crack well now you're introducing all these areas in an off-road scenario for rocks to tear apart the tire so they're using a harder All Season like compound but it still has to have grip in the snow and as you can see it has the three Peak Mountain snowflake meaning it meets the industry testing for snow traction to get this symbol okay so harder compound and inside with the belts and Plies we also have a harder Tire carcass so you might look at this massive sidewall and think oh that's probably great for ride comfort and there is some truth to this but in reality this is a much stiffer sidewall versus a typical summer or all season Tire part of the reason for these large sidewalls is to reduce the chance of puncture of course along with a very strong internal structure this gives you more space between the ground and the wheel giving you more distance and more time to handle any impacts so the trend with sports cars is to have very short sidewalls super low profile tires but throw this in a high-speed off-road scenario you hit a rock and that pinches the tire with the wheel and you blow out the tire these sidewalls also protect your wheels since you have all this space that rocks or let's face it for some people just curbs aren't going to be hitting your wheels in addition all terrain tires are often run at much lower pressures depending on the driving situation so if you're in sand or mud drivers might air down their tires to get a bit more grip well you need that strong sidewall so the tire isn't damaged in these scenarios okay so you've got stiffer compound stiffer carcass stiffer sidewalls now let's get into the tread design and one of the most distinctive features you might notice is the tread depth it's deeper than what you'd find on a typical all-season and of course much deeper than a summer tire and tread depth may seem insignificant but it has huge impacts on overall Tire performance so why use a deeper tread one part is that it means better traction in certain off-road scenarios essentially you have these massive gears that can dig into sand or mud and can help push you through it and you have better drainage performance for deep water but another thing you have to keep in mind is these are heavy vehicles and often these heavy vehicles have a lot of power so you're putting huge loads and heavy stresses on these tires that means lots of tire wear okay and as we mentioned we have a stiffer compound to help deal with this but what's another way to get a tire to last longer more tread you start with more material so you can handle the higher loads for a longer period of time and these actually come with a very impressive warranty at 70 000 miles for p metric or passenger vehicles and sixty Thousand Miles for LT or light truck applications like you see here on this Bronco according to Hankook this warranty is second to none for the segment and the simple reason for the mileage discrepancy between passenger and light truck is that LT tires tend to be used on heavier Vehicles which correlates with more wear and okay using LT as an example how do they land on sixty Thousand Miles for the warranty well in this case testing is conducted by a third party where they take a three-quarter ton pickup truck think 250 or 2500 series trucks and they put it through a real world mileage accumulation test that includes both on-road and off-road driving the proportion of on-road versus off-road driving is of course dependent on the type of Tire used so this all-terrain tire is certainly going to see more off-road use than a highway terrain tire but less than a mud terrain tire which is basically dedicated for off-roading so they put 16 000 miles on the tire throughout these different real world courses and based on that where they can evaluate how long the tread will last and you end up with the warranty numbers which they're confident they'll hit okay so a huge part of tread life is having sufficient tread depth but there are significant compromises you make when you have a high tread depth so let's talk through five major challenges wait tread chunking and rigidity noise steering response and rolling resistance all right number one weight and this is basically unavoidable right as you increase tread depth you're adding material more material equals more weight and this weight is at the outside of the tire so it has a big impact on the tires moment of inertia basically it's resistance to moving the bigger the higher and The more mass you put at the outside of that tire the more difficult it is to accelerate that tire so the added weight plus the location of that weight means worse fuel economy and worse acceleration but these are generally accepted sacrifices that come with vehicles in this territory okay number two we have tread chunking and tread rigidity and really it's two separate issues but they're very correlated so if you imagine a racing slick with no tread blocks just a smooth surface that's a very strong structure because it's all connected now if you do the opposite say you have long skinny spikes of rubber sticking out well these rubber spikes aren't going to perform well off-road they're just going to get ripped off the tire so basically you're finding a happy medium between these two extremes with an all-terrain tire you want the tread blocks to be able to dig into sand and mud and dirt but if you make them too tall they lose rigidity they're more likely to shear and chunk off but you've got a few defenses here of course a major one being a hard rigid compound as I I mentioned earlier also the larger and wider you create these blocks the more rigidity they have so you'll notice the tread blocks are quite large and finally you can have tie bars which you can see here on the outside of the tire which connects the outer tread blocks this reinforces the bending rigidity and helps it to prevent chunking moving on to number three steering response alright so as we just discussed as you increase tread depth meaning taller tread blocks you increase tread movement so if you have squirmy tread blocks your steering response suffers as a result you have more movement happening so it's never going to respond like a summer tire but everything we mentioned regarding tread chunking and tread rigidity is at play here to minimize the loss of steering response the story is similar with your sidewalls so tall sidewalls can hurt your steering response but by making them stiff you minimize the consequences Challenge number four is noise okay and this is basically unavoidable all terrain tires are simply going to be louder than typical all-seize and Earth summer Tires now tire noise is an extremely complex subject but one of the major reasons why these styles of tires are louder is because of the increased tread depth so as the tire rotates it squishes into the ground and this squeezes and compresses this tire pushing air out from these grooves and then as it releases from the ground it then pulls that air back into these grooves and this air pumping is constantly happening so you're constantly generating this noise as you increase the tread depth you're increasing how much space or how much volume you have in these channels thus increasing this air pumping effect thus increasing noise also since you have the tread coming up onto the sidewalls this can disrupt the airflow on the outside of the tire which also impacts noise so no matter what it's a challenge but there are ways that you can minimize tire noise first you have staged block edges so you can see in different locations you have this part of the tread block that's a bit lower and goes into the groove and the idea here is very simple you're filling in the grooves more so you have less volume overall the same idea goes for your land to Sea ratio where you have tread and where you have gaps from a noise standpoint you want to maximize the amount of land you have to minimize air pumping but of course you're fighting against having those voids for other purposes and the shape and direction of these grooves the main channels as well as the lateral grooves is very intentional to optimize for noise now the movement of these tread blocks also creates noise so again a rigid compound is helpful here as are the tie bars on the outer tread blocks so these time bars help reduce how much movement you have with these outer tread blocks less movement less vibration less noise and one last comment about noise the pattern of these tread blocks is very important as they continuously slam into the ground as the tire rotates this rhythmic nature generates a vibration and thus noise but you can improve this care characteristic by breaking up the pattern so as you can see they use what appears to be very random tread block widths so you've got a really large one here a really small one here and different variations and this is very intentional it breaks up that sequence this is called multi-pitch sequencing and it's done to reduce tire noise finally we get to number five rolling resistance and again this is unavoidable if you have more tread depth you have more movement of your tread blocks which generates heat on top of this you have a heavy Tire with a large surface contact area and all of this negatively impacts fuel economy now yes these tires aren't generally used on vehicles where you know fuel economy isn't the top priority but it's still an important characteristic for modern fuel economy standards saving money at the pump and better efficiency means you have more power so again we go back to a rigid compound as well as rigid sidewalls which are both important for reducing rolling resistance but the real reasons for that rigidity is dictated by by the driving scenarios and types of vehicles these tires are used on additionally as this is a three Peak Mountain snowflake Rated Tire the tire has Sipes for better snow performance you'll notice the zigzag nature of the Sipes improving rigidity which also minimizes the impact on rolling resistance and they're also at different orientations to optimize grip in any direction okay a few more unique features that are worth pointing out you'll notice a Highway Tire has straight grooves running down the tire for wet traction on this all-terrain the grooves are zigzagged Hankook says this is done to minimize damage to the tire when off-road and also that it helps to shed mud and Stones so the straight open grooves like you have on this highway terrain tire they're really not doing much for you in the mud right it's simply just going to slide right through that straight Groove versus if you have a zigzag pattern well now that acts like a shovel or a scoop pushing against that mud as it squeezes into the grooves also you'll notice the tread of the tire continues onto the tire's shoulders and partially up the side walls so this is really helpful in loose surface scenarios when you're in sand or mud or dirt these shoulders can shovel away at the environment letting you drive in deeper sand and mud they can also help in rock crawling scenarios where the side of the tire is wedged against a rock providing additional grid and not only do you improve off-road traction but you also better protect your sidewalls from damage or punctures so big picture we've got a stiff All Season like tread compound with Traction in all four seasons a durable carcass and a deep wide tread to handle every off-road scenario while still offering a really long tread life and all of which is optimized to allow for a very roadworthy Tire this is no small feat I hope you've enjoyed this I think we constantly take for granted just how incredibly complex and in my opinion how incredibly cool tires are so a big thank you to Hancock for sponsoring this video and getting the access to engineering to learn all about them I'm happy to say there are more videos like this on the way if if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
