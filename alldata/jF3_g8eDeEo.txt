in Python there are many reasons you might want to understand what your current IP address is and in this video I'm going to be going over how we can actually retrieve that with minimal code so we're going to actually be using vanilla python for this and all we need to do is import our e and we're going to go ahead and use another native module which is the URL Library dot request and from that we're going to import URL open which works a lot like the requests module we're just going to open a link that tells us the IP address and we're going to read the binary data and we're going to return it in human readable form so to do this we'll just create a function called get IP and that's going to return to us a string now first we need to get the source and the source is going to be the URL that we want to open so in this example we're going to go http double dot double slash and check dot IP Dot d-y-n-dns.com and this is going to return to us the response with our IP address incredibly quick after that we want to make sure that we can actually read this data because when we get this back it's not going to be readable to us so we're going to have to decode that Source data and to do that we're going to go ahead and convert The Source dot read to a string now if we go ahead and print this data you're going to notice that it's not going to give us exactly what we want so let's go ahead and try to print this so get IP and when we go ahead and run this you're going to notice that we're going to get a lot of irrelevant data such as all of this HTML stuff and the IP address that we actually want to get so we want to isolate this so we will only have the IP address and to do that I'm going to close this and I'm going to continue on this exact line and we're going to be using some regex for this so IP string is going to equal re dot search and we need to search for the following pattern and it's going to be backslash D plus backslash Dot and we need to use this four times because that's what creates an IP address except on the last one of course you can omit the last dot because all we need is a digit a DOT a digit a DOT a digit a DOT a digit so anything that follows this pattern is surely going to be an IP address and since this website only returns to us our current IP address we're always going to get our IP address and we want to search for this in the data and then we want to group it then we can go ahead and return the IP string and this time if we go ahead and assign this to a variable and print the IP we're going to have our full IP address printed to the console and that's how you grab your current IP address from python using only native python modules but there are so many ways to grab the IP address in Python so definitely feel free to share one of your implementations in the comment section down below so we can always compare it and learn something new I always love to see what you guys come up with or if there's some sort of easier version that I'm not aware of of course but as always guys with that being said thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next lesson
