ladies and gentlemen I broke a record a couple of days ago I made a YouTube video where I showed you a chess game that I played on chess.com hit game review afterward and it awarded me several brilliant moves and an estimated ELO of 3200 which is on the likes of Magnus Carls and Hikaru well today I will be sharing a game with you that I played at a higher accuracy than that and received a game review estimate of three thousand and four hundred I'm very proud of this game the last time we did this I showed you the live footage and then I analyzed the game today I will be just sharing the game with all of you and then we will take a look at the game review afterward a lot of you like this type of content because I make a lot of different type of content you like to make fun of low ELO games you like to enjoy magnus games but this is a game you can both enjoy and learn several things from so you know put me uh next to you while you eat and listen to me on the airpods or smart TV or wherever you're watching uh and before we jump into the game I'm there's no sponsors so you don't have to you know Skip ahead but I was invited to an amazing podcast uh that is organized by team liquid uh the Esports org uh and they were sponsored by Alienware the company that makes laptops and all sorts of amazing things uh and the host is this guy's toast and it's called two people talking I'm gonna put a link to it in the description it's me talking for 30 minutes so hopefully you appreciate it it's just about my life and it's a little bit different style content uh big shout out to them we recorded this episode in Los Angeles so so I just like to do these things like to share them with you and I will put a link to the description it's not a sponsored thing it's you don't have to buy anything um my opponent for this game was Jack Rogers who is an Italian that's the Italian flag right oh Australian sorry it's bad with flags I'm just kidding maybe I'm not actually you can just think I'm stupid uh and Jack played D4 D5 C4 he played the Queen's Gambit um Jack is a streamer as well uh and I I chose to accept the Gambit um of course you can decline the Gambit you can play the album counter game but you can play the chagoran you can play the slav defense you can play a million different things here I play a lot of different openings uh I have a course on Chesley on the Queen's Gambit declined with A6 and I've been playing that quite a lot but I decided for this game Let's Play DC now I do not recommend the Queen's game but accepted for like 99 of the rating ladder because you are not going to be able to preserve this Pawn with black and in many lines white is just going to get the entire Center so I do not recommend Queen's Gambit accepted I mean you can play it sure but you really have a big responsibility on yourself to know how to equalize if you're going to take that pawn and lose the center I've played many lines of the Queen's game and accepted and against the move E3 trying to win this Pawn back immediately I like to play E5 counter attack black basically is trying to distract white it's like trying to distract a dog on the street from picking up garbage with you know a squeaky toy or something and basically if white decides to take this Pawn instead it is very inaccurate because white loses the right to Castle and black now catches up in development castles quickly and is in very good shape and if white doesn't do that if white doesn't take this Pawn then black is going to take the pawn back and white will take and then develop and things will be normal um I have played this line many times he takes D4 he takes D4 Bishop D6 Knight F3 Knight F6 castles castles Knight C3 Knight C6 it's just a very very standard position but there is one line that is very cancerous and it is this line Queenie to check and this line is very annoying it's actually I think he even played Knight F3 Knight F6 Queen E2 check and according to stockfish White is better basically forever like black will never be better because black has to trade the Queens this is very meta stuff you don't really have to worry about this so what I like to sometimes do is I like to play Knight C6 Knight C6 is extremely provocative it's provocative because first of all it allows the move D5 which is not a very good move but it's it's a very aggressive move and then I would like counter-attack the bishop or drop the Knight back and we would get a closed position there's another line here that's extremely provocative Knight F3 e E4 and white here can play Queen B3 counter-attacking this Pawn on F7 trying to set up very nasty intentions uh and uh for example black will play Queen G5 and uh White can take and then play Knight G3 and bring the bishop back to a fancy KQ it's like very very sharp stuff it's very complicated and very convoluted and that is why I like to play the move Knight C6 now here Jack played the move Knight E2 this is not a good move as you can see with white if you play What's called a not a good move uh you you are just equal which is the way chess Works White has the luxury of moving first so if white plays a move that's not fully accurate white is not going to be in a worse or losing position white is going to be in an equal position you should be developing your pieces to their most natural positions you should not play Knight E2 but he played 92. and at this point I was like well I mean the night's not in its natural Square so obviously this is not a great thing I can play Knight F6 Bishop D6 Bishop B4 Castle I decided now to play e takes D4 my logic was that after e takes D4 obviously this is a better version of when the Knight is on F3 right like I just showed you a line where we can get this and the queen E2 check stuff but this is just clearly a better version because the Knight is not in its most active position and queen E2 is not possible and I thought okay Knight F6 and we will develop our pieces and we will castle and I thought he would Castle short he would counsel short I would play Bishop D6 or Bishop B4 I would Castle I would play Bishop F5 and this is what's called an isolated Queen's Pawn iqp Queen's pawn it has no Neighbors on ENC and white is trying to push it forward black is trying to blockade it by trading blockading it on the D5 square and then winning it he played Knight C3 this is a move I expected I played Bishop D6 and I expected him to Castle here um and just a little mini lesson in and of itself again I I like to make these uh videos of my own games to brag about my intelligence but I also want to teach you a few things a little quiz chess quiz is there a Greek gift sacrifice on H2 the answer to the question is no why Bishop takes H2 is possible that is one check mark Knight G4 check is possible that is a second check mark Queen H4 looks like it's winning but in this position white can stop Queen H4 Queen H2 rather with Bishop F4 it's very important that the opponent does not have a backup to play defense okay you have two of the three Necessities to land the Greek gift sacrifice here but you do not have a guaranteed mate and after Bishop F4 you lose but none of that even had to happen because he went Bishop E3 and then he played H3 and I was like okay well now I can obviously play H6 A6 rookie eight Bishop F5 I thought you know he's stalling so I should also stall but the move A6 has another idea which is that I would like to play the move uh Pawn to B5 and also I would like to prevent this but I don't think A6 is you know I should obviously be playing Bishop F5 in this position and he played the move H3 to prevent me from going Knight G4 like even here I could have considered playing Knight to G4 to just get the SEC to just get the bishop and here's a nice way that he can land himself in some you know very in a very dire situation for his King you know so castles H3 A6 and he played the move A4 right he plays A4 which stops me from playing B5 and I develop okay let's pause we've both made 10 moves who's better how do you determine that how do you determine in the chest position who is better so far I haven't played any particularly extraordinary moves uh but uh and I'm doing a good job uh why uh black is a slight is a little bit better why why material equal King safety you know what's funny is let's say White Castles in this position probably equal right probably equal the only reason black is considered better here according to the computer is the odd configuration of these four pieces these four pieces I mean nothing's right like this bishop is stuck in two pawns the Knight is passive and A4 is an overreaction to the move A6 because now the B4 square has access you see my friends when you move upon two squares you weaken things that it used to be able to control one square is okay zero squares is also okay one square you can still go two when you go two with a pawn Yang going backwards the computer here thinks that to meet B5 my opponent should play A3 why because unless it is absolutely required a smaller commitment from a pawn might be better it just might be better best example I can give you on the other side of the board H3 is fine H4 is insane Knight G4 and I Target the bishop in the night you know the Knight will never get kicked out so a couple of these things contribute to the fact that white does not have a great position and here he continues to waste time and it's more often than not a good decision not to go backwards in chess so moves like Bishop D3 moves like Bishop C1 or Knight C1 or something like that um he should Castle he should try to make some forward progress but he goes back to D3 it's not a great move it's not a great move because in chess three does not always equal three this trade benefits black more than it does white why because if this trade goes down in any capacity he has lost one of his active pieces that Bishop was probably White's best piece I still have three very active pieces he doesn't this bishop is not good this bishop is Knight is not good and I can go Knight B4 and then I can put my Rook as a Target and he still hasn't castled so he's wasting a little bit of time here this is this is the bad thing about the move Bishop D3 now I can take the bishop and that's a completely reasonable move but I opted in this position to do something called keeping the tension there's a couple of ways to keep the tension in this position one of them when you're faced with a bishop trade is the rock back just rock it back this is fine but I figured that this doesn't really make me any progress in the position and it's okay for me to take toward the center because there's no way for my opponent to get in toward my king there's another way and it's to reinforce your piece now there are two ways I can reinforce my piece right now I can play Queen to D7 which defends it with the queen and I can play 97 which defends it with the Knight and then maybe I can take on F5 now judging from what I've been saying in this video are you paying attention are you listening do you just have me on you're just doing some you know kitchen work while I talk to you well now I'm going to make you feel embarrassed because I'm calling you out pay attention look at the screen pause what you're doing I'll wait I'm gonna take a sip of this smoothie Lucy made me look at the screen and pay attention let's get better at chess all right I've talked about making progress in a position I say unless you have to go backwards you are absolutely certain you have to go backwards don't go backwards make progress in the position which of these two moves makes progress in the position this one I defend my Bishop I connect my Rooks and they are going to go to the center lines where they are going to be useful the E and D files are open I've traded those pawns off which means my Rooks would go like this now he takes which allows me to make progress with my queen and he plays Queen to B1 offering me a trade of Queens should you trade queens or should you go away why or why not right why or why not it's better not to trade the Queens it's better not to trade the Queens Queen H5 is not necessarily the best move but you can go Queen H5 Queen E6 Queen A5 this is letting White Off The Hook there are only so many pieces that you can trade on a chessboard that trade does not in any way shape or form benefit black like there is no world in which it does because you could say well why can't Castle but white could Castle this way however keeping the queen on the board allows black to have future prospects and furthermore why is this queen here right two things White's Queen desperately went over to B1 looking for an exchange but it didn't get one so now you look kind of silly right you're over committed so what does my opponent do place here my opponent was too nervous to Castle still thinking that I would create some sort of attack maybe a rookie or maybe a rook here maybe bring my knight so they played Queen C2 now I played Knight before in this position taking advantage of my opponents move several moves ago right so every single move that I'm making has a logical decision behind it okay it like every move that I'm making builds upon the other I improve my position I castled I developed my pieces I threatened B5 making my opponent over commit and now I'm taking advantage of that now Queen to D2 now what 94 not possible we don't have any checks right what do we do how do you make a plan in chess these are all things you're learning if you're still here 14 minutes into the video you're not bored yet because I haven't like screamed The Rook or something or spilled something on myself good you're gonna learn some more stuff what do you do when there's nothing to do in chess what do you do when there is nothing to do in chess do I have any checks no not that I'm good attacks no captures no does my opponent have any threats maybe G4 but then I can just take right Knight G3 I can just take improve the position make a move that doesn't over commit that improves the position rookie 8 or Rook d8 choose one I choose here simple improving move played in one second I don't know what my opponent is going to do but they choose to Castle queenside as you can see the computer really doesn't like that move why does the computer really not like that move my opponent played that move with the intention of playing G4 F4 Knight F4 Knight G3 starting a big attack opposite side castling is the equivalent of dropping the gloves in hockey you're gonna fight how do you fight when you're on opposite sides Pawn breaks piece play so in this position anticipating G4 and the arrival of these pieces I played the move Queen to G6 I thought for a while I thought for 24 seconds I was calculating between B5 straight away starting an attack and allowing G4 Queen G6 I was unhappy with this because I thought maybe my opponent could play something like A5 actually and stop me from getting there but I decided to play Queen G6 and I thought I can play B5 but now I have eyes over here and I am threatening two different checkmates the move Queen G6 simultaneously targets the C2 square and it also cuts off the king's Escape so Knight A2 is made so now both of these pieces are frozen because of both of these pieces you can't move either of them because I will mate you or I will mate you on A2 so now it is kind of a Unstoppable Force meets an immovable object since I know these two pieces cannot move I now suddenly am much more confident jumping into those two squares that are controlled by those pieces and furthermore a move like F4 loses on the spot because I can take the bishop I can take the bishop because the queen cannot say back my Rook these are the things these are the piece mechanics you have to pay attention to my opponent played the move G4 I cannot sacrifice now because then Fe but I played Knight D5 with pressure on this with pressure on this you cannot take because Knight A2 is mate my opponent went H4 looking to create an attack you also may be asking yourself isn't G2 free yes it's not a priority though if something like I don't know B3 was played in this position if you take on G2 you are a nutcase okay that is insane why would you open the door to this that is not the priority of the position so G4 played I play Knight D5 H4 and right before my opponent is able to cause enough problems I realize the queen and the pawn are overloaded the queen is overloaded it can't guard two things at once so I take the bishop now I get a brilliant move for this one Rook takes E3 taking advantage of the rapidly failing piece mechanics in the white position Queen to G2 G6 to C2 is made so you cannot do this also by coming here I am pressuring the Knight I am pressuring this and my opponent plays H5 and now I rotate my queen I avoid this but I defend my Rook so now I am a pawn up I still have a very strong attack and I am not trying to take any of these pawns if my opponent plays a move like H6 in this position I can just ignore it I can also just play G6 but I can also just ignore it okay my opponent plays the move D5 simple straightforward I slide my queen forward one square my winning ideas in this position include putting a rook on D3 putting a rook on E8 converting everything or there are two ways to win a winning position you can simplify down to a completely winning end game like two pawns up or you can go for checkmate opponent plays Knight D4 I play Rook D3 I'm now pressuring the queen I'm pressuring this opponent plays Queen F2 and I notice here my Rook cannot be taken because of this Fork so Knight Queen on same diagonal as one of my diagonal attackers Bishop C5 I pressure this I pressure that I pressured that that that I cannot be taken Queen G5 check anytime I want it my opponent plays Knight E2 which drops the Knight back and defends this but when the Knight moved it took its eye off of something it used to protect I play Queen takes D5 I am now up 30 seconds on the clock I am up two pawns Queen C4 Queen A2 are knocking on the door to the white king D4 has tremendous pressure mounting on it this is under Fire and in this position my opponent resigned the game had my opponent continued the game with something like Knight C3 of course I would just take and something like this with check and I'm completely winning easiest way to win this take the Knight easiest way to win this take the Knight drop back make sure you don't get background checkmated and win the game my opponent resigned and then I was informed uh that uh I played this game at the accuracy of I will show you I played this game at the accuracy of 97 percent and I got an estimated ELO moment to apologize for this uh terrible blunder um here we go a little bit ugly I don't know why it's so gigantic just very excited to show you this uh giant thing here I will shrink myself I do not need to be 97 brilliant move 3400. I'm proud of this one my friends go check out the disguise toast uh Alienware Team Liquid podcast by the way I'll see you the next video get out of here
