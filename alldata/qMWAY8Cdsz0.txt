this tweet from Ian Anderson is a preview of what you'll see if you load a file that uses Pantone colors in Adobe Creative Cloud after November 2022 and if you think that's outrageous you're absolutely right creators projects are suddenly getting help for ransom all because Pantone the color control Monopoly got into a slap fight with Adobe the creative software Monopoly and somehow managed to come out looking even worse worse than Adobe no one likes Adobe Pantone did this to force users to pay their own 15 per month subscription on top of what they already pay for Creative Cloud and to say that the internet hated that would be putting it very lightly to say that I hated that as the owner of a company that makes such heavy use of Pantone that I spent ten thousand dollars on their fancy colored plastic would be like saying water is wet but hold up there are so many questions right now like who even is Pantone whose fault is all of this really is there a workaround and who's the sponsor who's gonna help cover all this cost it's sea Sonic see Sonic's Prime TX 1600 watt power supply features an 80 plus titanium rating hybrid fan control and a 12 year warranty learn more at scosonic.com or through the links below Pantone has been around since before the digital age and today is best known for producing color swatches in various mixtures and materials that aim to ensure that when you specify Pantone 1655c to a printer or fabricator your ad or screwdriver or hoodie will definitely be exactly LTT orange unless the producer messes something up it's a proprietary system and a Walled Garden but when it works it works really well and we use it all the time at Creator warehouse and for our own channel branding and while it's a pricey system it saves so much time and effort going back and forth with Partners trying to get a color just right that it's kind of actually Justified they don't even need a color calibrated display because you can calibrate right in the real world this convenience comes at a cost though pantone's different material color matching books cost hundreds of dollars each and that's what the expected education that they will ideally be replaced every year or at most 18 months take it from me rebuying this crap all the time sucks but it also makes sense considering that paper inks fabrics and even Plastics do Fade over time diminishing the accuracy of the color swatches which defeats the purpose entirely thankfully Adobe added support for Pantone spot colors back in Photoshop 5.0 allowing you to use colors in your digital art that can be easily verified by your printing partner the problem is that those Pantone books I was talking about don't come with a digital Edition or license to use them in for example Photoshop or illustrator so when Pantone revoked the license that they had previously issued to Adobe to include Pantone color books with Creative Cloud end users were left with solid black instead of LTT orange or short circuit purple or whatever else even if they created their file with those colors before Adobe and Pantone parted ways and it's this that pisses me off the most the fact of the matter is that I'm the customer and when I look at both Adobe and Pantone all I see is massive corporations that are ranked as some of the most profitable Enterprises on earth like Are you seriously telling me that Pantone so desperately needed to make that extra little bit of money that they couldn't have just made a small adjustment to the prices of their already ridiculously expensive books and then on the other side adobe's profits have gone to the moon since moving to a subscription model whatever Pantone was asking for could they not have easily absorbed it even without raising prices but they didn't and besides Linus you might say you took the complete opposite position with YouTube's 4K paywall debacle and you're right I did but there's a reason it's because that's a fundamentally different situation 4K video playback is a massive undertaking in terms of development storage costs and the bandwidth cost to serve it compared to lower resolutions that has a real cost a real ongoing cost such that it outstrips whatever ad supported viewing could possibly sustain in the long term and yes Google is a massively profitable company that could simply absorb YouTube's losses wouldn't be the first time but they're not obligated to and the Silicon Valley mentality is Shifting right before our eyes YouTube as a business unit needs to get profitable on its own if it's going to survive with Adobe on the other hand well color accuracy is a core part of their business the core service that they provide for any number of professionals to have to do their work without color matching on what is meant to be the set of tools for doing design work that's a hundred percent f and there is no ongoing cost argument digital ink don't fade and the whole situation revolves around what is literally a collection of files that are less than half a megabyte in size this is a licensing thing it's a pissing match and it has nothing to do with any real cost what's worse Creative Cloud isn't exactly getting any cheaper to compensate us for the loss and functionality Adobe will simply be pocketing whatever amount used to go to Pantone or using it to buy figma for example now you could on that subject argue that adobe has provided more and more features and services as time goes on to the Creative Cloud Suite but that's sort of the point of a subscription model to begin with isn't it if they stop adding features they couldn't even pretend that they're not just rent seeking off of software they've long ago recouped their Dev costs on and locked people into I'm not going to give them any bonus points for increasing the power of their Monopoly here and for their greed both Adobe and Pantone are now suffering a serious blow to PR over this dumb spat that resulted in colors being removed from creative software that has had them since at least 1998. for me though that's not the real issue my question is if they can take this away from me what else can they take away from me Adobe no longer sells Perpetual licenses to their software products and Creative Cloud subscribers are provided only one major revisions worth of older builds so if Adobe decides unilaterally to downgrade rather than upgrade some function you are going to be forced to go along with it whether you like it or not I don't know exactly how this whole thing went down both sides seem tight-lipped about it likely for legal reasons but I do have some theories and the most likely one in my opinion is that Pantone saw that adobe was becoming more popular and more profitable than ever and since Creative Cloud has millions of active users paying for Access every month then gosh dang it Pantone should get a cut of each of those subscriptions whatever happened next Adobe likely told them to pound sand and Pantone connect pantone's own subscription service that costs nearly as much per month as Photoshop itself was born now you might be thinking Pantone doing this is kind of the same thing as what Adobe did back in 2013 when they transitioned from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud and the parallels are there massively expensive semi-regular purchases getting replaced with a smaller monthly fee that makes it easier for Freelancers and occasional users to buy in but increases costs in the long term that's just one problem with that Pantone connect in spite of the app's admittedly cool features like color extract is pretty much useless on its own you still need the regular expensive purchases like the physical books to compare against because even the most precisely calibrated cameras and displays have fundamentally different color gamuts than inks and plastics it's the fundamental reason Pantone exists to begin with when you buy these expensive books and color swatches then in my opinion you should get access to the digital databases for at least the usable life of the book say 12 18 months now some of the listings mention it but none that I can find explicitly say you get online access so unless I'm missing something here you are now being forced to pay for your books and chips and a monthly fee and in adobe's defense the vast majority of Creative Cloud users people like photographers artists and especially casual users have never and will never use Pantone for much of anything the people who do have a need for Pantone People Like Us at Creator Warehouse are the ones losing out and as much as it pains me to admit it we are the ones who are most able to absorb the extra cost looking at it from that perspective while we'll probably never know what Pantone was asking for I can kind of see why Adobe wouldn't want to absorb it or pass on an increased cost for pantone's licensing to all of their users and if I'm right about that I don't have the numbers to back it up then the outrage from the internet at large might be a little overblown even if the whole situation is hard to swallow Adobe isn't innocent here either though if you've tried using Pantone in Creative Cloud recently you'll probably have noticed that colors are straight up missing or wrong because ever since Pantone started with connect Adobe has refused to update them Pantone claims that the reason for this is that adobe hasn't bothered to update them since 2010 and the facts seem to corroborate that why Adobe left Pantone hanging like this is anyone's guess until one of the two fess up maybe they're trying to build their own color matching system with blackjack and hookers they certainly have the spare cash to throw around the good news is that if you're one of those people who desperately needs to cling to adobe's apparently quite outdated Pantone books and can't or doesn't want to pay pantone's fee then you're in luck there are ways around it at least for now for one thing three books are still going to be part of the suite so you might not even need to bother with any of this if you're covered by those arguably the easiest workaround if you aren't though is to Simply copy the books out of your old version and plop them down into the new one that doesn't have it this may not work forever though and obviously those outdated books aren't getting any fresher this way another solution is to opt out of the Adobe experience altogether by using Affinity by serif unlike Adobe Affinity does have the latest books from Pantone and you're dropping a one-time fee to purchase the software though you do have to pay to upgrade between major revisions just like you used to with Creative Suite back in the before four times they also have the added benefit of having mobile apps that don't suck then there's the other solution I would never advocate for software piracy someone clearly does Photoshop has long been one of the most pirated applications in the world and while many people did sign on with Creative Cloud it never really stopped and this whole situation is one of the reasons that Pirates Who otherwise have the means to buy do what they do and if anything the reasons they have for pirating Creative Cloud have only broadened and Adobe and others who are looking to emulate this software as a service business model should be taking notes think about it when you sign up for any software as a service what are you actually getting you're not getting the software not really you're getting access to the software and that's an important distinction actually getting the software means you get to keep it and use it in perpetuity it may not get support or major new features without a paid upgrade but you have the choice to do that or not and up until Adobe superseded Creative Suite 6 was create of cloud you had that choice some people even held on to even earlier versions of Creative Suite and I cannot stress this enough all of those people can still use Pantone colors and outdated as they may be when you pay for access to software you're subject to the developer's whims yes it's often at a substantially lower cost of Entry but how does it add up in the long term Creative Cloud might seem like a steal at 55 a month compared to paying hundreds up front per app but after just under four years you will have actually paid for the most expensive all-inclusive CS6 package that existed and that price which incidentally is what you're locked into after the free trial comes with a yearly obligation that's right I still remember when I found this out the hard way when I wanted to remove one of our Creative Cloud Suites if you cancel early you get slapped with a big fat fee if you want pay as you go instead it's 82.49 a month and you'll hit that crossover point with CS6 in less than three years with the added bonus of not even getting to keep it and Japan tone colors when you stop paying and what would happen to you as a subscriber if adobe's authentication Service went down alright we've seen what happens the entire creative world screeches to a halt and if Adobe shut down everything tomorrow literally everyone using Creative Cloud would be screeched to that halt permanently no matter how much they've paid this is the problem with software as a service and there are many parallels with always online games and this situation with Pantone is as much adobe's fault as pantones and Adobe is also responsible for the lack of competition in this space that might give Pantone or their users any leverage I mean what are you going to do use they've already purchased most of the serious competition and the rest have caveats that people in professional settings can't really work around if they want to be able to collaborate with everyone else who's standardized on Adobe Adobe has effectively created its own little Monopoly sandbox and almost universally their users are unhappy about it but like they always have they ensure a steady stream of new users by supplying students with dirt cheap rates to learn on so that they are well and truly hooked into the ecosystem by the time they graduate in case you were wondering by the way how it came to be that adobe became the de facto standard for professionals all of which is to say neither Pantone nor Adobe are coming out of this smelling like roses and The Biggest Loser as always is you the customer this time we got away with a mere 15 a month extra fee this time it only affected a small subset of users but what will they come for next time what will they charge to get it back if companies are going to provide this one price all access software as a service experience only to have it be degraded like this and the users accept it you can expect more just like it in the future just like you expected this Segway to our sponsor team group it's that time of year once again team group is having their
