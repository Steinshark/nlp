hello everyone and welcome let's say you're in the market for a 2020 model year car and you show up to a ford dealership so you want something that's fun to drive and has a manual transmission well you might think ford focus rs great car manual transmission unfortunately they're not selling that anymore so then you might think well what about a fiesta st also a super fun car manual transmission also they're not selling that anymore so you are left with the mustang no not that mustang the other mustang and the good news is there's still a lot of variants within the mustang family that you can still get a manual transmission in unfortunately as of 2018 i feel like they kind of ruined that manual transmission and so that's we're going to be discussing in this video so we're going to be comparing the 2015 mustang gt with a manual transmission versus the 2020 mustang gt with a manual transmission now the big changeover actually happened for the 2018 model year so 2015 through 2017 were pretty similar 2018 through 2020 are pretty similar and some of the big upgrades for the 2018 model year you got 25 additional horsepower so 460 horsepower you got 20 pound-feet of additional torque so 420 pound-feet of torque and you got an extra 500 rpm added to that red line so a 7 500 rpm redline versus 7000 for the 2015 to 2017 mustang gt however the unfortunate news is that they dramatically change the gear ratios for the 2018 and thus 2020 model year transmission and so that's what we're looking at right here we're looking at the calculated top speed for each individual gear so for example for the 2015 in first gear that'll go up to about 42 miles per hour in the 2020 that's about 48. as you can see that dramatically increases as we get further along so 64 versus 75 in second gear 117 versus 157 in fourth gear and so one of the things they did is actually they took fifth gear from the 2015 and they made that fourth gear for the 2020 so fifth and fourth have both have a one to one gear ratio and so effectively what you're doing here is you're adding a highway gear to this uh the newer gt and you're taking away a fun gear from the previous mustang gt and the thing that i really like about the previous generation strategy is if you look at this speed so we're just looking at the blue bars right here if you look at that speed as you go through those gears you can see that's a nice close ratio and you would think it might end somewhere around here and instead it doesn't it bumps way out and it has a top speed and sixth gear of 237 doesn't mean it can actually reach that it's for cruising on the highway to keep that rpm down but you can see that there's a path that's kind of happening right there and then it breaks for six so really what they're doing is giving you a five-speed close ratio transmission and then for six gear they're saying look you're gonna want better efficiency on the highway so we're gonna give it to you i think that's the best strategy you can possibly have with a manual transmission and then for the 2018 model year they stretch that out and so you can see it's kind of all one linear path right there but you really get two highway gears and then you're left with kind of a four not as close of a ratio gearbox for one through four look let's say you're cruising at 60 miles per hour on the highway and you want to pass someone in front of you so you downshift well in the newer mustang it would actually make the most sense to downshift to second gear and that'd feel pretty awkward on the highway and again these are considering we're using the highest final drive ratio so a 3.73 final drive you can get these with a 355 which would mean all of these numbers would be a little bit higher but consider being on the highway 60 miles per hour and then saying okay i'm gonna go to second whereas for the previous generation it makes more sense to go to third and that'll bring you up to 92 miles per hour so naturally you might wonder why would they do this and it's a very good question that i don't have the perfect answer for uh so when you look at this you might think well maybe they did it for fuel economy reasons even though it's an enthusiast car with a v8 uh it's not exactly something that's going for fuel economy but perhaps by adding this amount of power in the higher red line maybe they lost maybe one mpg and so they had to change the gearing in order to make up for that because both of these cars are rated about the same in the city about 15 miles per gallon and the same on the highway about 25 miles per gallon so unfortunately you get worse gearing and you don't actually get a fuel economy improvement and so you know that's the other thing looking at this i think you know if you're buying a manual transmission vehicle you're probably doing that because you like to shift gears by yourself and in a vehicle like the newer mustang gt the requirement to shift gears is far less often and so really you're going to go first second and by that point you're at whatever speed you need to be and then you go to your highway if you're cruising and so you kind of have this fourth and fifth that really aren't that necessary um you know they're they're going to get you better fuel economy and low speeds where you can just go to the highest possible gear that isn't sixth gear but if you want you know that fun shifting experience really the previous generation mustang offers a much better gearbox for that next i want to look at highway rpm so if you're cruising on the highway at 70 miles per hour what is your engine speed going to be at so whether you're in the 2015 with a manual or automatic or you're in the 2020 mustang gt with a manual or automatic what is your highway rpm traveling at 70 miles per hour in top gear and so as you can see it's nearly identical for all of them a range from 2027 in the newest automatic which is a 10-speed automatic so just over 2000 rpm uh versus in the 2020 manual it's as high as 2083 rpm so not a big variance and that's why as a result your highway mpg is 25 for all of these they all get the same highway fuel economy even though one has a much more fun gearbox in it and why is it more fun well that comes down to wheel torque so i want to compare the wheel torque between the 2020 mustang with the manual versus the 2015 mustang with the manual and again remember the 2020 has an additional 20 pound feet of torque coming from that engine so in order to calculate wheel torque we're going to take the torque from our engine we're going to multiply it by the first gear ratio in that transmission and then we're going to multiply that by the final drive ratio both of them are going to have the 3.73 final drive ratio in this example and so we'll use the first gear to differentiate and so if you look through each of the different gears first second third fourth fifth sixth you can see that in every single gear except for six which who cares what your wheel torque is in sixth gear you're just trying to get fuel economy at that point in every single year the 2015 has more wheel torque so this is wheel torque and pound feet 5456 pound-feet versus 5071 a significant difference there and so look at each of these the previous generation even though it has less torque has more wheel torque in every single gear except for six by three pound feet and i think that's super disappointing you got the latest and greatest and you're actually going to experience less acceleration how do i know you're going to experience less acceleration well you have to do some additional math so torque is equal to force times distance in this case the force we're trying to apply to the ground multiplied by the radius is our wheel torque and so we're trying to figure out what is the actual force that this vehicle can push along at now the good news is the 2020 gt actually has a slight gearing advantage because the wheels have a slightly smaller radius for the 2020 model year and so that does help a little bit so we can actually compare the acceleration for each of these doing a little additional math so we figure out what our force at the wheels is force is equal to mass times acceleration and we can figure out what acceleration is by taking what's our wheel force and divide it by the weight of the car that'll tell us the maximum g's that each of these cars will be able to accelerate at okay so first looking at the 2015 model year we're comparing the six-speed automatic transmission versus the six-speed manual transmission and we're looking at the peak acceleration in gs what would the driver actually feel in each of these gears so in first gear the automatic actually has the advantage in the previous gen 1.39 versus 1.28 g's in the manual but then after that the manual has more aggressive gearing for all the gears and so as a result it has better acceleration so in second gear 0.85 for the manual 0.78 for the automatic 0.59 for the manual versus 0.51 so a significant advantage in third gear and as you go on now how does this change for the 2020 model year thankfully it does have more torque and thankfully it has a smaller radius so that helps out right well unfortunately it still provides less acceleration so in first gear 1.26 gs versus 1.28 in the previous gen 0.82 in second gear worse than 0.85 in the previous gen and 0.55 in third gear versus .59 in the previous generation and so again it's just disappointing that you got the newest you got the latest the greatest it has more torque and yet it's slower in each gear now the good news is it can hold onto those gears longer because it's a taller gear and because it has that higher rpm so it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a slower vehicle but the actual acceleration force that you feel on your body which is probably what gives you the joy not the actual number of what was your 0 to 60. the actual push back on your body as you're getting pressed against that seat will be greater in the previous generation mustang and so then if you look at the 2020 automatic transmission which has a 10-speed automatic they went all out here and they made it super fun so that's kind of the disappointing thing is that the manual got worse the automatic got so much better so if we look at the numbers for the automatic transmission first gear peak 1.73 g's second gear 1.1 oh geez third gear 0.79 fourth gear 0.65 fifth gear 0.56 so look at this in fifth gear with the new mustang gt with the automatic transmission you'll have more acceleration than in third gear with the manual transmission and that's because it's a 10 speed so it has all the options there but they give you a ton of aggressive gears now something to keep in mind this thing cannot accelerate at 1.73 g's this is the theoretical limit if you actually take into consideration the weight distribution and you consider that this has probably about a 1.1 frictional coefficient the peak acceleration g's you'll see are about 0.65 um so anything in in this case in first gear or second gear you're not going to be able to actually use all that uh and then in this automatic first through fourth are going to kind of be you're going to be at a traction limit and not uh you know a power limit now if the car is just sitting there and you're trying to do a burnout well then you need less force overall because you don't have that load transfer and so anything above about 0.5 gs is going to allow you to do a burnout and so as you can see in the new mustang with the automatic transmission you've got five burnout gears right there versus in the manual you've only got three there and rolling burnouts you could even do up to fourth gear in the new one only in second gear in the the manual transmission version so you know just kind of unfortunate that the automatic is so good it's going to be more fun from a acceleration standpoint i'm not talking about you know more fun because it's quicker i'm saying it actually gives you more acceleration obviously the shifts are going to be quicker but the disappointing news is that it's also going to give you more acceleration now some assumptions that go along with these numbers right here we're assuming the car weighs about 3 700 pounds we're not including the weight of a driver in this math right here they all weigh about 3 700 pounds they actually do the manual and the automatic uh way very close to the same amount we're assuming our torque converter is locked up that doesn't apply right at the launch you're going to have some extra torque multiplication in first gear but for the most part it's going to give you fairly accurate numbers once you're moving we're assuming no tire deformation and we're assuming each of these vehicles is using the highest available final drive ratio so that's 3.73 for the manual transmissions and 3.55 for the automatics so 0 to 60 times this is something people get pretty fired up about so let's look at it so these are all tests from motor trend all the same company doing these tests with various different mustangs the 2015 manual transmission mustang with the v8 and 3.73 final drive hitting 0 to 60 in 4.4 seconds the 2018 or the 2020 uh what zero to 60 is that going to get with its new and improved engine more power more torque once again 4.4 seconds that's really the disappointing thing you got the latest you got the greatest nothing changed as far as your 0 to 60 time but if you were to get the automatic the motor trend tested the 2018 automatic and they were able to get 0 to 60 in 3.9 seconds that is faster than when motor trend tested the 2019 mustang gt350 so an automatic transmission uh mustang gt quicker than a manual transmission gt350 of course part of that is the fact that it is shifting quicker but the other huge part is that they give it these really aggressive gear ratios so it can put down a ton of wheel torque uh so that's that's kind of the disappointing thing here how quick is that automatic the automatic is genuinely better in pretty much every way except for driver involvement and so that's disappointing to see because this number could be better that 4.4 could be better with better gear ratios and here just as comparison the 2020 gt500 which has a dual clutch transmission motor trend tested the base gt500 at 3.7 seconds so just 0.2 seconds faster than a 10-speed gt that's pretty wild that's pretty how wild how close the 18 automatic and the 20 gt500 are of course you know this gt500 is going to start pulling away after 60 miles per hour because that's so much more power but up until that point in legal daily use speeds the automatic mustang gt is about the same speed that is wild so again we come back to the question why would they do this why would they change the gearing strategy here one theory may be well they did it for fuel economy except they didn't really gain any fuel economy so another theory might be well maybe this strategy in red here is better for a track but the thing is if you compare the gearing of the gt versus the gt350 which obviously is a track car the gt350 has much more aggressive gearing it has a strategy much more similar to the previous generation gt which i quite like and then you know you could get into the conspiracy theories which i'm sure you will have in the comments about how maybe they want to prevent this from being too good except the automatic is already pretty much too good and you know if you were to give the benefits to this gt yeah maybe it could get close to the gt350 in performance from zero to 60 but in my opinion really if you drive those two cars back to back you will realize how special that gt350 is it is truly one of the best drivers cars out there period regardless of price the gt350 is absolutely incredible and the mustang gt is very good but even if they were to have the same 0-60 time i would still much prefer the gt350 over it so it's hard to say you know what's the strategy in going into this maybe it just makes for an overall more better daily driver experience where everything's kind of a smoother shift from one to the next i really like the get into sixth gear drop your rpms as low as you can get them get good fuel economy if you actually need to accelerate put it in gear that helps you accelerate so that's my personal preference let me know what you guys think thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave
