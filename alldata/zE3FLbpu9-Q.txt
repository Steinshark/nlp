we've done 10,000 three times we've done 30,000 twice but we've never given $40,000 to twitch streamers every time somebody donates of me you plays do it this guy deserves $5,000 all right so this next person is called chica I've actually played for night with her you know she was pretty chill she actually carried me to a W and you know when someone cares you to a W up for tonight you got to show them a little respect you know boys thanks for getting me of that W thanks for getting me that W that one for tonight game I am forever in debt to you thanks for getting me that W that one for tonight game I'm forever in bed with you I would love to die it out again yeah is it sad that a woman can kick your button for tonight no because it's 2018 when we could be getting video games mr. Bean's oh my god thank you so much for that donation well the game and I donate another thousand no I swear to god she dies she's gonna feel so bad win the game and I donate another 1000 what you can't say that in the middle of a gun to say that oh my god thank you so much I'm sorry oh I have almost 1500 wins look thank you so much thank you so much JK what I'm sorry that is my girlfriend in the background who just screamed who's watching the stream I have to go harass other people later mate thank you so much mr. gates so harass other people later Amy thank you thank you so much for that donation I really appreciate those obviously I can't afford to give away $40,000 every week without help hence why this video is sponsored by honey which is an add-on for your browser available on Google Chrome Firefox and Safari and basically it scans the entire Internet and automatically plugs at discount codes when you're shopping online you're gonna click the link in the description of this video you're gonna click Add honey alright then right here you're hit allow you're gonna hit add and boom I clicked like maybe two or three times it took maybe five seconds hey Chris you want a pizza yeah well this pizza is $32 you know what look our convenient little honey add-on it's like the plaque coupons all right honey I'll hit apply coupons it's now we're gonna scan all of the internet and test coupon codes for me and if it finds one that actually works it'll apply it so honey found a discount code called save 25 I did they didn't tell me to do this I just picked you know a random site that's actually pretty crazy so it was 32 dollars now it's 25 dollars simply because I spent five seconds to get the honey add-on and hit apply coupons I save seven dollars like literally some people make like $7 an hour like you could save an hour of your wage if you're working minimum wage just by having this add-on and boom our $25 pizza that technically what $32.00 was just ordered I can't wait for it it tastes so much better knowing that I saved money so in this instance we're shopping on this pet website and it couldn't find a discount code but that is good if honey can't find a discount code for you then you can rest assured that there's not a single discount or promo code on the internet if there was one honey would find it for you either you save lots of money or you know you're not getting ripped off I mean it's really a win-win thank you really used some stuff to organize my kitchen and while that's going I just want to say that in case you're wondering how honey makes money they never sell your information right the way honey makes money is whenever they find a discount code for you that works the site gives them a little commission for you know like encouraging you to buy things but they don't sell your information they don't do anything any of that nonsense they just get a little bit of Commission for helping drive a sale to these websites it's a win-win because these are discount codes you never would have found on your own like come on right here is my link to honey it's linked in the description click it right now and install it it is free and will save you lots of money though later in the video we get the more crazy of their donations we'll get so make sure you watch the end because this video is going to get really crazy while you guys are out here landing in fatal fields and stuff she's dropping tilted towers oh no she's not nevermind all right I have never been donated that much money ever I've been zooming for two years a few funny few day it was like have you ever been if you haven't been donated that much money how about this much money I don't know I don't know mr.
