they abused their Authority they abused the trust that the American people would have in that Authority I I I just think it's a very dangerous situation where you have this this guy who has to be compromised considering all the pies that his family was in and all the millions of dollars that flowed through to his son and his brother and various other family members you know how can Joe Biden not be compromised [Music] hello everyone watching and listening today I'm discussing something truly explosive I would say with columnist and writer Miranda Divine we're talking about her 2021 book which should be old news by now but hasn't been well covered enough to be that laptop from Hell Hunter Biden big Tech and the Dirty Secrets the president tried to hide we delve into what Hunter Biden inadvertently unconsciously or purposefully revealed about his family's business dealings how they built and maintained the regime The Surreal but comprehensive coverup by the so-called deep State enforced and willing collusion with the Legacy and social media companies and the aftermath yeah we're not done with that yet not just for those directly involved not just American citizens but for innocent people all across the world find themselves in the midst of political psychological and physical Warfare it's quite the episode I thought maybe we'd open up with actually the story of the laptop itself because and we might want to what might as well walk through this in chronological order and so Hunter brought three laptops as I understand it into this laptop shop do you want to pick the story up there and we'll wander right through to the point where the New York Post is publishing it and then it's the story isn't covered we can set the stage for everyone just so they remember exactly what's going on so do you want to walk us through that story sure um so it's April 2019 and late uh at night uh Hunter Biden goes into John Paul ma Isaac's little computer repair shop in Wilmington and Hunt has been at a cigar shop nearby he smells of booze um and initially John Paul MAAC didn't recognize him he just felt a bit of irritation that someone was coming in with three water logged La laptops right on closing time um and uh he booked them in and um Qui pretty quickly ascertained he couldn't um immediately fix uh any of them and uh then um Hunter signed a work order and gave his contact details and went away and um the next uh day or two um jum for ma ISAC is looking at three laptops he's figured out one of them he can just give him a new keyboard separate keyboard and that will work and he figured out something with another one of them and the third one he decided he would have to upload the contents onto his um big server and then um uh you know give the contents to uh Hunter on a on a hard drive he called Hunter and he said can you come in and uh bring in um he told him particularly what the hard drive was he wanted and sure enough the next day Hunter brings the hard drive that he'd asked him to bring and um John Paul ma Isaac gives him the other two laptops one is a Rite off one he's given him a keyboard with it um and uh and then Hunter goes away and jumo Mac ISAC continues to um it's a very slow process he said to upload all this information because the um the battery kept on running out on the laptop so he had to keep on charging it and then restart and every time he restarted he would have to look on at the material to see where he was up to and that was why he sort of had such a a kind of intimate understanding what was on the laptop and um you know what initially struck him was just there was so much porn on the laptop that's so I mean it's home made porn it's um it's Hunter uh filming himself having sex with various women um filming himself naked and so on but jumo Ma ISAC also noticed um you know a lot of business documents invoices and a company called barisma which uh popped up a lot so um he completed his work and he called Hunter to come pick up his laptop and got no response he was texting him and emailing him and he wanted hunter to pick up his property and to also pay his $85 bill um and that didn't happen and so 90 days later as per the work order um H the property became his uh he he owned it now and uh he just put it on a shelf and didn't think about it anymore um and then um so we're talking about April 2019 and Hunter dropped off this lap top just about a week before his father announced that he would be a candidate for president and uh Hunter at the time was in a rage against his family absolutely furious with them at the end of his tether he felt that um Joe's staff that he'd amassed in his campaign were disrespecting him and his father was allowing uh them to disrespect him um and uh you know there were Stories being brief to Friendly media that Hunter is a basket case he's a drug addict um you know he's just a bird and his father has to put up with and as far as Hunter was concerned how dare they uh treat him like this um and and shame him when uh he felt that he'd um supported the entire family the extended family for for decades and uh he he'd uh given half his money to pop as he raged to his daughter one day he said unlike Pop I would expect you to give me half your salary so um that's the context that Hunter dropped off the laptop and never returned to pick it up despite all the incriminating evidence on it um incriminating of his father uh as much as him okay so so what are we what are we supposed to make of that like I'm trying to understand this so first of all I'm I'm thinking about it the way I would think about it if I heard this story from a client so the first thing I'd wonder is um the timing is suspect like why would you drop off those laptops a week before your father announces his run for president it seems it seems uh to call it careless is to barely scrape the surface especially when you know perfectly well what's on those laptops not only this U Treasure Trove of homemade pornography which is like a Highly Questionable Enterprise and and of itself you have to wonder actly what motivates someone to continually film himself engaging in sexual activity with with all the various hookers that he was consorting with in strippers and so forth there's a narcissism about that that's quite remarkable um but also there's a there's a vindictive carelessness about it that's also Market because it's not one laptop it's three and three is a lot and they're rif with information that's devastating personally right I mean you wouldn't think you'd be sharing your homemade pornography with the world and and also there's this immense amount of detail about all of these business enterprises that have been accumulating for decades what is an observer to make of that no is is he is he that addled that he didn't even noticed that this was foolish or is there is there a desire to be caught because that's certainly a possibility or is there revenge against his whole family including his father I mean I I don't know how to make heads or Tales of this because it's so utterly preposterous it's it's not surprising in some ways I suppose that one of the reactions of the broader media was to assume that this couldn't possibly be real because when you read it and I mean I'm still recovering from reading your book and I want to delve into that as deeply as possible to establish let's say its credibility but I I really I'm taken aback by the material that that you reported in laptop from hell I I don't know what to make of it I was thinking about what I would do in Joe's position in so far as I'm able to do that so now I have a son and he's I'm speaking as Joe here I have a son and he's he's a bit of a juvenile delinquent let's say except he's not a juvenile he's 50 and so he's about 30 years past the uh due date on juvenile delinquency and he's rocking up a fair Fairly High Financial bill on the hooker and cocaine front and the penthouse in Las Vegas he's acting like the evil son of a Hollywood villain in every possible way what am I supposed to do with him and the first thing I would think if I had any sense is well how about I don't put him in a situation where he has more money than God because that's the last thing you want to do with someone who's addict let's say especially to Something Like Cocaine because an unlimited supply of money means an unlimited supply of drugs then you might think well I'm also president and my son is behaving in a way that well doesn't exactly shed a positive light on the family but also is dangerous in all sorts of ways maybe I shouldn't be taking them on my business trips there is a plan maybe I shouldn't be introducing him to world leaders all over the all over the planet especially in Russia and China and Ukraine for example or in you know any number of other corrupt countries that we might mention maybe I should have him for his own good supervised you know and for the country's good so that he straightens himself out and doesn't get in a tremendous out amount of trouble instead of enabling him at every turn and and then what and then what tangling us up in Ukraine in a way that's morally hazardous to say the least like I look at the situation in Ukraine I read your book I looked at Hunter Biden's dealings with parisma I think well is there a 5% overlap between the Biden's Financial interests and the fact that we're in a bloody war or a 1% overlap because the right amount of overlap is absolutely zero when we're talking about war with Russia so you went through this you've been living it for a long time like what position did you start with when you started assessing the laptop material and what happened to you and the way you were looking at things as you walked through it yeah look I um I sort of came to it disgusted I guess because you know opening up the laptop there's just so much sorted material there um I ended feeling sorry for Hunter and feeling utter um contempt for Joe Biden and also feeling that Joe Biden is a really bad person um as you said what kind of a loving father puts his addicted son in front of a torrent of unaccountable cash and that's what he did um you know it wasn't that he was just enabling Hunter Hunter was a an integral part of the family influence pedling business Hunter was the bagman um you know there's a video where you can see taken quite some time go hunter is quite young um he every job that Hunter had um every you know University position that he had was due to his father he didn't have the marks to get into Yale law school and so favors were done um he his first job out of college was at a wildly inflated salary for one of Joe's donors in Delaware and from his salary he complained that he had to pay not just his um College fees off but also his brothers um that was the way Joe worked it you know he he posed as the poorest man in Congress uh while living a champagne lifestyle while um not really having any bills to pay the usual bills that normal middle class families worry about like you know helping their children get through get to the you know the best college they can and pay somehow paying the bills uh getting them to private schools getting the grandkids in the into the same thing uh you know internships judgeships uh fellowships cushy government jobs you name it all of these things were there for the taking for Joe's extended family and um and you know I know that Joe Biden spent his entire life building this mythology around himself that he's a good family man a devout Catholic modest Joe workingclass Joe lunch tell Joe um and it's all a lie um he's the family part I think is intriguing because um Joe Biden's always had a um you know a Fascination um or a desire to be like the Kennedy Clan and so he's constructed a life and a family uh sort of image that's very similar to that um and there was a a fascinating interview that he did with Kitty Kelly when he was just uh newly in in the Senate newly widowed um and he was very cocky and uh would talk about um she said he dressed like Great Gatsby you know Gatsby esque very well dressed and um he would talk about himself as uh you know having had the the the greatest wife that any man could have had and their sex life was just brilliant and no man's ever experienced that and uh not not in a sort of a moring way but in a boastful way um and just talking about himself in a way that you know like he said Rose Kennedy the Kennedy matriarch keeps on inviting him over for Jenner but he's too busy um and you know sort of boasting that the kennedies are his friends and and that they're throwing themselves at him uh but you know he he sort of fobs them off um so he's a very peculiar person and I think he and he also has always it's not just that he's cognitively challenged now and he tells lies and Tall stories he's always been a fabulous he's always lived in this kind of delusional Fantasy World um where he sort of self- aggrandizes and creates these stories about himself as the Conquering Hero even if he never was in the place like he was never with Nelson Mandela or he was never at Ground Zero or um all these places that he puts him self in and um I don't even know if he really understands what he's doing but it's it's a pathology and um and so I think to myself about someone like Hunter you know this little motherless boy who's a bit ADHD um bit hyperactive very smart and um he has this father who's Mercurial and not there very often and has this huge job that's obviously more important and the entire family Revol around Joe and it always has his mother put Joe on a pedestal and all the siblings roles were to uh serve Joe and and so Joe as an adult that's the way his own family behaves and then there's the stepmother Jill Biden who comes in when Hunter's around about uh eight or nine who doesn't who who Hunter anyway feels doesn't like him she loves Bo his older brother by one year um but she doesn't she Hunter feels that she just doesn't like him and so that's a huge burden and if a father that lies all the time I'm sure broke promises all the time um is very destabilizing and um and you know another example of Joe's cynical exploitation of his family is that um he had just been uh won an election to be sen to be a senator right this was the the biggest thing in his life and his family's life he was only 29 years old he was 30 by the time he was sworn in the youngest Senator and um his wife dies in a car crash tragically just a few days before Christmas while he's away in Washington and um and their baby daughter is also killed and Hunter and his brother Bo are like two and three years old and they're very badly injured and so this is a just a a devastating block over this young uh Senator elect and um so he he ends up being sworn in at the hospital bed of his children and so he invites all the the you know the world's photographers into this hospital room and he sets up a Podium there and he's sworn in and all the photographs show in the foreground these poor one little motherless boys uh bandaged Hunter has a brain injury his brother B has a broken leg um and they're just listlessly lying in bed while in the background their father is being sworn in and I just you know that that photograph touched the heart of everybody I mean you would have to be completely heartless not to feel great sympathy for this poor widower and his poor little boys right but you also might be wondering why that photo op is staged that way if you were particularly cynical and curious exactly and that's that that's that's what I came to think afterwards how cynical it was of him to do that and he's used that photograph in every campaign since and and so it takes on a new very Sinister light I think well okay so I want to go two directions I want to return to the laptop I want to talk about Mac Isaac and his attempts to bring the laptop to the attention of the FBI and then the eventual press response but before we do that I want to talk about delve a little bit more into Hunter and his business Acumen so you know I've had a lot more economic opportunities put in front of me in the last four or five years and that makes interacting with my family it allows us a lot more opportunities but it's also complex because once you have a lot of opportunities personally it's hard to know exactly how many opportunities to offer your family members let's say your children because you want to offer them opportunity but you want them to stand up on their own two feet and to do things for themselves and so when I was reading your book I was thinking okay well Joe is in a position to offer Hunter opportunities and um people do that for their children and as your opportunities multiply it gets harder to draw exactly the lines but you don't want to put your kids in a position where their opportunities exceed their capabilities and so what I kept wondering when I was reading the book was well Hunter is being put in front of all these International leaders let's say business people if you were going to make a case for Hunter's business Acumen and ability how would you do that because it looked to me like the opportunities were not proportionate to the ability I couldn't tell what it was that Hunter had to offer apart from access to his father and if you were trying to defend him you know in good faith he has a legal degree he has a legal degree from Yale he's he's intelligent by your own admission it's like why isn't the story that Hunter is running his business Affairs as an independent individual why isn't that an acceptable story if it's not um look I mean I I think that that the business really wasn't a business I mean they didn't have a product they weren't manufacturing anything um the business was influence it was it was contact with his father it was um uh you know at at at one point his uncle um Jim Jo Biden's younger brother um decided that they were going to go into the business of selling uh gas to from Louisiana from Monkey Island uh to the Chinese and so there was something it's all it's all sort of business deals and there were always other people um Hunter's business partners who took care of the sort of pesky details um like setting up a business um and doing the due diligence for it and so on that was something Tony balinsky was brought in to try and legitimize what they were doing um but the the fact is that Hunter was not interested in business he found it incredibly boring what he had always wanted to be was a an artist or a writer and look I mean he's now both you know he's written his Memoir um and and he's also doing paintings and uh I know that's a grift in itself and it the way the White House has handled that has been appalling and um the art world is known for uh money laundering and and so on so um it's it's not the wisest choice but still I mean my sister's a a good artist and she looked at Hunter's art and she said it's good so there is something there I mean you know and he's um the reason I feel sorry for him is I think that this is someone who has been utterly crushed and um you know by his father not really crushed but but sort of manipulated ated by his father and I guess it's to his credit that he really hasn't been crushed I mean it's his freedom is expressed itself in this sort of malevolent way that he's just so destructive to everybody around him and in into his addictions uh and his utter selfishness but um but you know this is this is someone whose father just treated him as a as a spare as a as um as you know the bagman as just for utility uh because the oldest son Bo was The Golden Child who also was being treated as an object in in a way as sort of the apple of his father's eye who was going to uh continue the the sort of Dynasty the dynastic Ambitions of Joe Biden and become president after Joe so okay so you pointed to something fairly specific there you know because I said well you know how do you if you're trying to offer your children opportunities how do you justify that and one of the things you alluded to was while you look for where their talents genuinely lie and try to Ally the opportunities with those talents and you pointed out that Hunter can write and maybe he's got some artistic ability I've looked at his paintings and they could be a lot worse than they are like I see some Talent there the prices that are being commanded for them are well the art world is a very strange place so we won't say too much about that but there the prices are certainly a hell of a lot higher than 99% of artists would ever receive for doing anything no matter how spectacular in the course of their entire lifetime so but but you point out that as far as you can tell on the business front which is what we're speaking about there is actually no business there and so I have my children involved in my business Affairs my daughter is running this new Enterprise that we hope to turn into an online university and my son runs a software company but they've done the bulk of the work on both of those projects and they actual projects they have an actual There's an actual uh what there's an actual product there we have actual customers we right they're actual businesses and I don't feel that I've smoothed the road for them in an an appropriate way because all of these opportunities would have been sitting there languishing if they W wouldn't have taken the ball and seriously run with it and so that's what you want to do if you have opportunities at hand for your kids is you try to figure out a situation where if they work hard and act appropriately then they're going to benefit and hopefully bring benefit to other people at the same time and then there's no cost in that to anyone and I'm when I was reading your book I was trying to give Hunter the benefit of the doubt partly for the reasons that you describe you know he's had the whole family's had their fair share of tragedies and you have to write that into the story but for the life of me I couldn't figure out what in the world he could could have possibly be been selling except for alliance with the family name and Joe should have regarded that as an extreme moral hazard and we should all regard that at the moment as I said earlier as a bloody extreme moral hazard given that we're at war with Russia for all intents and purposes and so this just isn't acceptable you know and you said you feel sorry for Hunter and I can understand that too um and I think the family is capitalized on that sympathy but by the same token at some point you cross the line from victim to perpetrator and it seems to me you know maybe this is just my judgmental self but his his behavior on the sexual front in particular like veers into perpetrator rather than victim now you go out of your way in your book to point out there's absolutely no evidence as far as you can tell that he veered into say underage sexual activity and so that's a very important thing to point out but the what he's doing with his hookers and his strippers and his homemade porn is hardly wholesome family friendly Affair and that in itself apart from the business dealings might have been enough so that an intelligent father who was also simultaneously president would have put some damn serious walls between him and his son and maybe also around his son and that clearly failed to happen so at best we have a situation where the father is enabling and at worst we have a situation where he's where what his he's benefiting from the position that he put his son in in the same way perhaps that he benefited by by having those photographs taken when he was when he was confirmed for Senate I mean it's a damn ugly story right those are vicious those are vicious accusations and so they're rough things to Levy but as I said going through your book why should people believe you like why shouldn't they just think well here's you know Miranda Divine mck ring journalist and she's taking this laptop and doing everything she possibly can to you know to portray it in the worst possible light to for her own self grandis journalists certainly do that so why do why should people listening and watching regard you as a credible figure do you think well I guess I mean it's not me it's it's the evidence um that's that's what the the book is I mean it's just laying out and trying to distill in order this mess of a laptop um and you know every every part of it is straight from the laptop I haven't invented anything um and I verified uh the material that I used by talking to um various of Hunter Biden's Associates and former partners who um who whose names are on the laptop who were CCD into um into emails and were part of businesses and you know their names appear on documents um for instance I mean one I can name is Tony balinsky who was Hunter's uh business partner in the the final sort of Chinese deal with CFC and uh he Tony balinski I have the contents of his three devices that he also handed over to the FBI just before the 2020 election and um that overlaps with and corroborates um that Chinese section of the of the laptop um and I mean recently Devon Archer has uh come come Out of the Shadows he's another of Hunter Hunter's sort of former business partners but also hunter called him his best friend in business and in fact Devon um he's quite a wholesome person didn't didn't share any of Hunter's um Hunter's vices um he was doing the Lion Share of uh you know setting up businesses and um you know organizing things so that all that Hunter had to do was fly into some town and uh and you know get into a suit and stop smoking crack for a couple of hours and just go and meet these Chinese or whoever um and so Devon Archer also has testified um before this Congressional um committee and um verified a lot of the material um that I've written about um and I think just as time has gone on it's now you know almost three years um there's nothing in the book that hasn't been um you know verified over and over or corroborated or um proven no one has proven anything wrong and the laptop even though Hunt is still being koi about you know it's oh maybe it's my laptop or you know maybe it's not my laptop maybe it's Russian disinformation um whatever um he he he's he's you know his lawyers are suing um people for breach of privacy John Paul MAAC for instance for breach of privacy for exposing his material which he admits is his material so it's a it's a confusing sort of position to take have you ever heard of data Brokers they're the middlemen collecting and selling all those digital Footprints you leave online they can stitch together detailed profiles which include your browsing history online searches and location data they then sell your profile to a company that delivers you a targeted ad no biggie right well you might be surprised to learn that these same data Brokers are also selling your information to the

for defamation Etc and it has been quite a while since you published the book let's go back to Mac Isaac for a minute and continue the laptop story okay now in your book you said that and you and you just elaborated on that now because you know one of the things people might be wondering is well what the hell is this laptop shop owner go combing through this hard drive for to begin with that's really not his business but you accounted for that you said that that was partly a fluke on the technical side that because he had to keep rebooting the laptop and monitoring the upload he was he was uh confronted with the material and then that started to make him nervous now you detailed this in your book that Mach Isaac actually got extremely nervous once he realized what was on the laptop and he went to the FBI is that correct is that have I got that right and then the FBI did pick up the laptop and so let's lay lay that let's lay that out to the point where the contents of the laptop start to be made public by the New York Post because the next absolutely hideous and despicable sequence of events that occurs is that the New York Post breaks the story essentially and then the powers that be shut it down in all sorts of ways right Facebook does Twitter does um but even more stunningly you have dozens of security Personnel working for the government attributing the contents of the laptop to Russian disinformation and this is just prior to the election okay so let's go back to Mac Isaac he's looking through this laptop he's starting to short out he just runs this little shop and a bomb is being dropped into his lap he goes to the FBI that's correct what does the FBI do and then how does the story break Giuliani gets involved how does the story break well firstly what happens is that in the background here you have the impeachment um the sort of Prelude to the impeachment of Donald Trump uh Donald Trump's made a phone call with the Ukrainian president zalinski the new Ukrainian president and um during that public phone call um he says you know can you do me a favor and and H investigate what's been going on with Joe Biden and Hunter Biden and brisma basically um and uh because this had been talked about I mean it was very unseemly at the time the New York Times The Wall Street Journal uh that those sort of mainstream organizations media organizations that are now uh trying to explain away um these problems were actually reporting that it was pretty UNT that Joe Biden's son was um you know on the board of this corrupt Ukrainian Energy company and what they didn't know was that he was making a million dollars a year so so this was sort of the buzz in the background and the word barisma came up and um John Paul ma ISAC is a was a trump supporter no crime in that um and he was alert to the the sort of details of this looming impeachment and he remembered the name barisma so he went back and he scoured through the laptop and he found all these documents and that that was really what made him scared because he's in Delaware the way he explains it is the Biden's own Delaware um he was afraid that something would happen to him so he um he in fact he made several copies um he uh put one in an envelope and sent it to a friend and said don't open this only open it if something happens to me that was how frightened he was and he contacted the FBI but he did it through a Securus route through his father an uncle or something um in New Mexico and they got rebuffed um and really quite rudely um and he he made a couple of efforts and and nothing nothing happened this is from sort of like September and then November of 2019 he finally gets a phone call and he's asked about um this laptop and in December December 9 uh two FBI agents turn up at his doorstep question him he tells them he's got a very um forensic mind so he's really had figured out the what he felt were the most problematic um things on the laptop I mean what he thought were crimes and so he laid it all out for them and uh and then he was frightened because he said there one of the FBI agents left he said because he was worried about his own safety and he said what what will I do and one of the FBI agents he claims said to him well in our experience nothing happens to people who don't talk you know who don't open their mouth so he took that when he told me that I thought well you know I can understand you're being paranoid if that sounds very far-fetched but as the sort of cover up and the FBI involvement in it has has come to light uh I look back on that conversation and think well maybe he wasn't so off base uh so so what the hell did he have to gain well exactly I mean what he was what he was what he said to the FBI what he was hoping was he felt this was exculpatory information for Donald Trump to use in the upcoming impeachment and he wanted the FBI to know that and he's a very you know his father was in the the um in the military his uncle was in the military he's a very Law and Order sort of guy and he really had faith that the FBI would do the right thing and that's why he was so desperate for them to take it and he thought good well I've I've gotten that off my conscience I'm now protected and H no one will come and try and kill me for this which is really what he was worried about um but then the months ticked by and nothing happened and the impeachment was going on and he just thought this is ridiculous you know why does no one knows so he tried to contact UM various Republicans he tried Jim Jordan and lindsy grah and you know sent faxes and emails and phone calls and no one ever got back to him and um then he saw R juliani uh who was then president Trump's lawyer on television and talking about barisma in Ukraine and so he tried him as a kind of a last ditch effort he sent an email and um lo and behold Rudy giuliani's lawyer a guy called Bob Costello who served with him at the southern district of New York a very buttoned up very sharp lawyer um was intercepting Rudy's mail at that time uh for I don't know why security reasons or something um and uh he saw this letter and it was a very uh email it was a very well written email very detailed very precise um and he thought well this guy might be something he called him ascertained that he seemed on the up and up and got him to FedEx a a copy of the hard drive um to his home in Long Island and uh and then when he opened it up he um just saw evidence he was Bob Costello was the um I think Deputy head of uh the Criminal Division of the southern district of New York so he knows crimes when he sees them and he said he saw a lot of crimes on this laptop so he calls Rudy and uh they then this is sort of August late August of of uh 2020 and so they then spent spend the next 6 weeks or so just doing their due diligence on this trying to figure out if it's you know legit if it's real if it's on and they satisfied themselves up to a point where they felt they could hand it to the media without looking like fools um they brought Steve Bannon in at the last minute uh to help with some of the Chinese names because Steve's got a lot of uh connections there but Steve Bannon did not get a copy of the hard drive they did not give him one they were very close with of that information and then Steve Bannon started uh sort of alluding to it in the media um and uh he and and he started um you know and Rudy did as well trying to get various media to uh pay attention to it okay so one one side Venture here and then back to the story breaking in the New York Post so Trump is being hauled over the coals at this point for Russian collusion and when is it that Biden is in contact with the Ukrainian authorities to get the prosecutor who's going after brisma fired so that was in uh December of 2015 um he first uh tied the1 billion do in US Aid to um the firing of Victor shoken and um he did that uh pretty much off his own bat I mean it was us policy uh State Department policy to um to clean up corruption in the prosecutor General's office um Victor shoken um had been brought in uh just about a year before actually less than a year before he'd been brought in in February 2015 as a kind of A Clean Skin by uh poroshenko who was the American back president of Ukraine um to clean things up because there had been a huge scandal with his predecessor um the uh do you want me to go back into into the details of that well yeah well there's there's there's a loose end here I guess for me and and that is well um Trump is being accused of of collaborating inappropriately with members of a foreign country Russia in this case but we also have at the same time Biden who's made reference to this on the world stage getting a prosecutor fired and my understanding is that that prosecutor was going after barisma and and have I got that right okay and it's the same barisma that Hunter is involved in and that's paying him a million dollars a year yeah so barisma was owned by uh a guy called slfi um who was an a you know a mini they call him a billionaire um and it was but but behind slfi was a really ious oligarch called eigor kisi um who would have people's eyeballs uh gouged out um but he was um and and zesi had been a minister in the previous yanukovich government which had been sort of Russia aligned um and the uh the Americans wanted him out and I mean I I don't I don't think it's controversial or incorrect to say that the the CIA was involved D in uh the coup um you know how much they were involved whether they nudged or whether they were more involved uh who knows but they certainly were involved and um and so uh yanukovich was thrown out and he sort of corrupt as that I mean Ukraine's the most corrupt country in Europe one of the most corrupt countries in the world um and all the ministers fled uh from that government taking billions of dollars of Ukrainian people's money except for one u a guy called mikolai zfy who owned barisma while he did flee to Russia initially and then to Dubai he was allowed to keep his business his oil and gas business barisma and to continue to make money from it which I think is a curious Point um Everybody every other person involved with that yanukovich government um was forced out and had to flee but uh leeski while he wasn't allowed back in the country could continue to earn money and in fact could put Americans like Hunter Biden and his friend Devon Archer onto the board of his company to try and uh legitimize it and uh and keep the American sweet um and to put pressure on Ukrainian authorities not to investigate him um and uh you know Victor shoken um was brought in as I said after a scandal and the Scandal was that his predecessor who ran the prosecutor General's office a guy called urea had presided over um the collapse of a case that had been brought by the British serious fraud Squad in conjunction with the FBI against slfi they had Frozen $24 million of slf's money in a London uh bank account and uh this was a very important case for the serious fraud sort because it was um the showpiece uh that the the you know the government was boasting about and head of uh the serious fraud Squad had a whole conference about um that they were going to claw back the illg gotten gains of uh the Ukrainian uh oligarchs that had been banished from that country because they were aligned with Russia so this was a really important case and a bribe was paid uh to uh the prosecutor General's office people in the prosecutor General's office and um and the case collapsed and um the money a British judge unfree Froze that money and zfy could take it back and so this was hugely embarrassing to the US Embassy which really was running things in Ukraine and um they were being pressured the the Ambassador Jeffrey Patt was getting a lot of grief from the British who were completely Furious about the fact that you know they blamed the Americans for this happening why didn't you have control over this corrupt prosecutor 's office and poreno the president was under pressure as well so he brought in this guy reluctantly Victor shoken who was um sort of a you know kind of a superstar he was a very popular prosecutor he was always a line prosecutor had never wanted to be a boss um and he had been responsible for some very high-profile convictions and uh you know he was quite flamboyant in the way for instance one time he busted a corrup politician and he went into the rer the par the Ukrainian Parliament and he played video um and to to all the parliamentarians of uh this this guy sort of clandestine video of this politician accepting a bribe or asking for a bribe getting one um and and you know that was a major story and he'd also um uh arrested um The Killers of this uh of this journalist who'd been beheaded and his body trussed up and left in a forest and that was as uh um you know he he'd been um writing stories that were damaging to the previous regime and various oligarch so he he also uh busted that um story and that that case open and arrested those people and he was still pursuing the people behind them the powerful people behind them so he was kind of a without fear or favor prosecutor he'd already suffered a one assassination attempt when a sniper um uh fired through a window in a meeting he was at um and so he was a sort of a good choice for poroshenko to appoint as the prosecutor General and shoken says that he didn't want to do it um but he agree he knows it's political and you you know politics in Ukraine is very ugly um and so but anyway he reluctantly took it because he said penko appealed to his patriotism and uh you know I've spent a lot of time talking to shoken and um I mean not in his I can't speak Ukrainian and he can't speak English but through translators and and through Google translate and um he does strike me as a a very patriotic um proud Ukrainian and proud of his record as a prosecutor and there's evidence that he's given me to show that he was a very successful prosecutor and as prosecutor General there every year I mean there's a lot of bureaucracy there and a lot imposed uh by the Americans and Europeans on the prosecutor General's office so there was a lot of reporting going on and he's shown me reports where his uh Pro you know he had three times as many prosecutions of corrupt people um as either of his two predecessors so you know there is some evidence and I've also seen kind of in the background where he lives and he doesn't seem to live lavishly um and so um you know I I can't see any evidence that he's corrupt and no one has ever brought forward any evidence that he's corrupt so how did Biden how did Biden have him fired and why well um well shoken says that he was investigating lfy and barisma at the time and there is evidence for that because in February of 2016 about six weeks before he was removed shoken um issued a warrant for seizing all of zf's property in Kiev and that was you know a couple of mansions three plots of land a Rolls-Royce Silver Phantom car um that's uh you know that was reported in the Ukrainian media and but in other European media as well and so that's established that that happened and no one's ever denied that um and so you know that's evidence that what shoken is saying is true is that he was he he said he had more than one case he had several cases a foot of um against lfi for money laundering and Corruption and um and so on and uh and so you know therefore I come at this from well why are these lies being told by Joe Biden by his allies also by people um at the Atlantic Council um people who are sort of affiliated with that that sort of with sort of the Atlantic council is sort of the NATO front so with NATO people um and and the sort of Russia Hawks um that abound in American Academia they all backed um Joe Biden also there were some Europeans as well but again I've um you know interviewed for instance a guy called Jan tuminski who's uh was the EU ambassador to Ukraine at that time he was quoted as um welcoming you know shoken removal and uh there was always um anonymous uh sources quoted by The Washington Post New York Times and um the and so on Bloomberg um uh and Financial Times um all saying that the Europeans the EU wanted shoken gone because he was corrupt but Jan toiny when I interview him said no um look I I knew there were problems in the prosecutor General's office and it all comes back to that bribe that was paid in the the zesi um serious fraud Squad um case in London falling apart everybody was up in arms about that but that was not shoken um and chinsky says I didn't make any comment about shoken because that wasn't those kind of details were up to the ukrainians which is the proper way to behave and not only that I mean you know I found a European commission report from 20 December of 2016 um in fact it was um about a week after Joe Biden uh traveled to Ukraine on December 9th and gave that ultimatum to poreno that you fire shoken or you don't get the billion dollars in Aid um this European commission report was the final report um of their sort of investigation and sort of riding Ukraine to do various things including and very importantly to clean up corruption um in order to qualify for Visa free travel which was very important to Ukraine and um this report said yes they've satisfied everything and in fact um they can they now can qualify for Visa free travel and on the corruption front they've done very well there's been a lot of progress and they actually identified Shen's office as having made strides including setting up a new anti-corruption um office inside the prosecutor General's office and that um shoken had just appointed someone to that um and and you know there are letters as well from um from the summer you know August September um of 2015 from John kery and Victoria nulan John KY who was then the Secretary of State Victoria nulan was a senior State Department person um congratulating shoken to Victor shoken I've seen them saying you know good on

say let's go back to the emergence of the laptop story in the New York Post so why did the post decide to move ahead with the story what did they initially report and what was the consequences well so unbeknown to me I didn't really know anything until I get a phone call from sorry text message from it was late on a Friday night from Bob Costello and um I had been doing stories with Rudy Julian I just arrived um in July of um 2019 in America to do an 18mon stint cover the election um because my former editor colle Allen in Australia um was editor of the or editorinchief of had been editor-in chief of the New York Post he um asked me to come um and do this this 18mth stint which I thought would be a lot of fun and um the first thing I did was befriend Rudy juliani because uh when I lived in New York with my family in earlier times when it was uh crime ridden um uh you know I I had a lot of um admiration for what Rudy Giuliani had done as mayor of New York cleaning it up and I knew that he was close to Donald Trump so I figured if I wanted to cover Donald Trump um I would Eng gratiate myself with Rudy Giuliani which I did and um I had just written a story um about Rudy who'd been the first person to talk to Donald Trump after he'd gotten out of hospital um recovered from coid and Rudy loved that story so I guess I was top of Mind he'd been trying to shop this story around to other media and he had no nobody Buy fighting and time was running out um you know and he felt that he wanted to to get this out in the media before Trump had to to a debate against um the first debate against Biden anyway so Bob Costello sends me this text and he says look um there are four photographs in it from the laptop and he says this is a really good story let's talk and so next day we had a long conversation about you know the the email from uh jumpo Mac Isaac the crimes that were on the laptop um and he talked to me through it and uh he convinced me that and he's he's a very serious person and he convinced me that he'd done due diligence on it enough to satisfy him that he wasn't selling me a bill of goods but obviously we would have to do our own due diligence but it was enough to make me think this is pretty big and so I uh texted my editor um on the Saturday night um call Allen and sent him the photos and um then we had a conversation and um and then he just decided Well let's just put the entire um you know Newsroom on this and it was all guns blazing um reporter went down to Delaware interviewed John Paul Mac ISAC picked up the subpoena that the FBI had given him to when they collected the laptop picked up the work order with Hunter Biden's sign picture on it um you know we contacted people um who appeared on the laptop um I didn't I wasn't doing this reporting this was my colleague Emma Joe Morris and other people in the paper were doing this um and um look I there was there was trepidation in The Newsroom let's put it that way about this story because because Steve Bannon who had a bad reputation um for being you know loose with the truth was involved although he was much less involved than you know other our our competitors in the media claimed he certainly wasn't involved with anything I was doing um and Rudy giuliani's reputation already had suffered somewhat um and he' already been smeared as being sort of a an agent of Russian influence or you know victim of Russian influence um and so uh you know and Ukraine was sort of a dirty word I mean everyone was nervous about it but to his very great credit my and I don't think any other Jour any other editor in America would have done this but Cole Allen did it and he said no I'm satisfied this is a great story and remember this is three weeks before the election yes and he pulled the rip cord and our first story was uh you know Biden secret emails on the front page and it um mainly was about a an email from uh a barisma Executives to Hunter saying you know thanks very much for introducing me to your father and uh you know the The Peculiar behavior of the Biden campaign too um made it raised our suspicions because it was like to us they were saying oh you know maybe there was a meeting it's not on his official schedule you know he meets a lot of people to The Washington Post Etc no no meeting ever occurred um and uh there were all sorts of other strange things but strangest of all we sort of expected obviously in the middle of a very um tough election campaign uh to get push back from that side and from other media but not from social media immediately we we held the story until 5:00 a.m. normally it would go out at 10:00 the previous night but online we held it till 5:00 a.m. and um and within um three or four hours uh it had been shut down and censored by uh Facebook and Twitter and the first we knew of it was uh a Facebook executive who also happens to be very plugged into the Democrats um just tweeted that uh Facebook was now um going to I can't remember his exact words but it was basically throttle the reach of um of our story pending factchecking right which they still haven't they still haven't done the factchecking as far as I can tell because the first thing you would do which is what we did if you're factchecking is you would go to the other people who appeared on the emails that we were publishing and say hey did you get this email and Tony balinsky was already out there he wasn't hard to find he was on the emails uh you could have asked him but they have never contacted him so some fact check and then Twitter followed suit and who Twitter who at Twitter do we know yes so now we know I didn't know when I wrote the book but the story of the cover up I think is bigger than the story of corruption which is you know Age Old Washington story uh at Twitter were embedded um various FBI and CIA X operatives including uh in a very important role was a guy called James Baker who was had been the chief lawyer at the FBI did I say that and he'd been parachuted eight months before the election into Twitter as their Deputy uh chief lawyer deputy counil and um he was involved as we now know from the Twitter files um in discussions that morning October 14 2020 of whether or not to basically shut down our story um and and the the excuse that Twitter used was that we had violated their hacked materials policy and that's important it seems bizarre to us because nothing about the story was hacked but now we understand that for uh weeks beforehand the FBI had been briefing uh Twitter and Facebook although we don't know as much about what they were telling Facebook but I assume it was the same thing um they'd been briefing Twitter uh to look out uh in October likely in October to look out for a hacken leak operation hack and dumper operation um of Russian disinformation uh likely about Hunter Biden so and you think that was a consequence of them knowing what was on the laptop contents because it had already been turned over to them by mcisaac partly that was they had had the laptop since December 2019 but also there's a hidden part of the story which fits in which is that um the FBI had been spying on Rudy Giuliani since November of 2019 and which was about the time that John Paul MacIsaac was um contacting the FBI and saying he had this laptop right so and Rudy Giuliani was the president's um private lawyer so there was this covert surveillance warrant on his cloud and that meant that in August of 2020 when John Paul Mac ISAC sent that voluminous detailed email to Rudy Giuliani um the FBI if they were doing their job would have had access to it so they would have known the cats out of the bag right and then they also would have had access to his IM messages with me now there wasn't a lot we mostly spoke on the phone but there were a couple of uh messages uh enough when I looked back to see that um it was obvious that the New York Post was interested was going to publish I mean one of them I said don't give it to anyone else right we're you know it's all systems go here so they knew it was coming the medical establishment has been disregarding the lives of innocent babies for decades now many have grown cold and callous because of the surreal thought The Surreal reality that over 64 million babies have been lost pre-born will not stand silent nor should we we cannot stand by and let babies die at the hands of abortion that's why pre-born exists to stand up for those who cannot defend themselves the only defense for these precious babies is their heartbeat which begins at just 3 weeks and can be heard on ultrasound by 5 weeks when a mother making that ultimate Choice hears her baby's heartbeat and sees the precious life inside of her the majority of the time she will choose Life by sponsoring an ultrasound for a mother you are being the voice of the pre-born please join pre-born in the cause for life for just $28 you can be the difference between the life and death of a child dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby or visit preborn docomo all gifts are tax deductible and you will never regret saving a child's life that's pound 250 baby or visit preborn docomo well you know you just skipped over something you know about 5 minutes ago saying you know oh well by the way this is probably as big a scandal as the hunter laptop Hunter Biden laptop itself and it's like well yeah I would say so is the FBI is conspiring with Facebook and Twitter to suppress the story about the president's son being in cahoots with uh Ukraine a Ukrainian energy uh company three weeks before the election yeah I would say that's like that's that that makes Watergate look like nothing like seriously part of the reason I think that this story hasn't got traction is that there's there's so much explosive material in it that you can't even keep track of it it's just one Preposterous scandal after another and now the New York Post got kicked off Twitter entirely right wasn't not the case I think I got kicked off Twitter around the same time but you guys were gone from Twitter right and now the New York Post is the oldest newspaper in the United States if I got that right very influential newspaper but Twitter shut you down completely so let me add throw something else in here so of course I've been watching your country from the outside since I'm a Canadian and I've been watching Trump play The Stolen election uh uh song for well since the election you know and I've thought a couple of things about that I thought it was offbrand for him to claim victimization because Trump is the guy who tromps around and says I always win and in this case he didn't win and then I've talked to many people who've been analyzing the court cases where corruption in the election has been alleged and Trump has come out on the losing side of the vast majority of those and then I think well he's got the details wrong with regards to the election but he's got the meta narrative right and because I can't help and this isn't I'm not speaking as a trump admirer here by the way um um be that as it may one way or another his notion that see my sense is if the bloody laptop story hadn't been suppressed the election wouldn't have gone the way it went because it was a pretty narrow margin and this is a pretty vicious story and so the fact that the FBI conspired with Facebook and Twitter to collapse this story to to limit its reach and then to attribute it to Russian disinformation and then to have the security Community come out now you detail this in your book too there's dozens of people from the security and intelligence community that come out and say oh this is definitely Russian disinformation and one of the things you point out in your book is they had absolutely no evidence whatsoever to be making that claim and so now all of a sudden your story disappears and the New York Post is off Twitter and it's 3 weeks before the election and it's a very narrow election and it turns out that Biden wins it's like well to call that a scandal is to say almost nothing it's and it's no wonder that Trump's story that the election was stolen resonates with his base even if it's not stolen in the detailed way that he describes there's certainly something unbelievably rotten going up going on at the highest possible levels of essentially fascist collusion right government the presidency the White House itself the FBI the CIA Facebook and Twitter all colluding to take down the New York Post for reporting on the corruption of Hunter Biden yeah you'd kind of think that would be front page story on on a place like the New York Times for example if it wasn't corrupt Beyond Comprehension yeah not just corrupt but I also wonder um you know since I've been investigating this story I see um you know the intelligence Community as so embedded uh in social media you know in Facebook and Twitter um and and and manipulating behind the scenes and censoring it's not just the Twitter files it's this incredible court case called Missouri versus Biden um where uh the charge is that and a judge has actually did find that the Biden Administration is appealing that but found that um the Biden administra the government was um putting enormous pressure on these social media companies to censor anything their narrative I mean whether it was on coid on vaccines on the Ukraine War uh memes about um Jill Biden uh you know anything that that was detrimental to the government was Vero and the the government was holding over these social media companies the threat that the Republicans are into as well that that ought to be followed through on actually that they would break them up and and use section 230 which which allows them to escape the uh the normal legal um constraints that a normal publisher like the New York Post has um but so that was the threat hanging over them and you okay so so let's let's delve into that for a second okay so now we have a situation where the president's office itself has been found in violation of the First Amendment direct violation of the First Amendment it's not some accidental violation it's a programmatic repeated violation of the First Amendment and the journalists let's say at the New York Times or at CNN for that matter MSNBC aren't smart enough to understand that a direct assault on the First Amendment actually well let's say threatens their livelihood in so far as they're actually acting as journalists so how do you make sense out of the FBI CIA collusion with the White House why the hell would they do that and then what's going on with the journalists like this is something that just makes my jaw drop it's like of all the things that you would think would light a fire underneath journalists it would be the assault by politicians on the First Amendment so like what the hell why why is this happening well there two things there so on the journalism I my feeling is that if the social media companies are basically controlled by intelligence operatives so too must be the nework yor times and the Washington Post The so-call Prestige Brands they wouldn't bother with the New York Post but the New York Times for instance is an incredibly powerful entity it dictates it sets the agenda for newsrooms across the world I've worked in um you know in Australia as a journalist and and in Britain and the the New York Times is incredibly influential and it's sort of all the news that fit that's fit to print if it's in the New York Times you can take it to the bank that has been um the the you know its its brand and and I've just seen through the Russia collusion um stories and the stories that I have done deep Dives on particularly the laptop story that they pedal lies outright lies and um and the Washington post as well they do factchecking you know when you actually go back and look the shoken thing I know I spent a long time talking about it but there is layer upon layer of so many lies and it's not just lies it's its documents disappeared uh internationally um it's it's a it's an operation it's not just journalist being sloppy or one corrupt journalist this is a concerted operation the likes of which you would get from you know spies so I don't know exactly how it works but a rule of thumb that someone told me is the state department these days is about 50% CIA so um you know and you you know in there's various ways you can tell who's CIA and who isn't in and they they these spies operators diplomats so why are they why are they so aligned why are they so aligned with the Biden Administration like I wouldn't think that necessarily that the natural allies of the security intelligence Community would necessarily be the left-wing Democrats like so so H how do you how do you account for that it's not really about that it's about well I mean partly it may be but but because Washington you know they're they're all from the swamp and in Washington 90% of people vote Democrat but I think it's something more and I think this is why um Trump was perceived as an existential threat because actually when you look at his presidency um he he just you know he didn't do any he didn't start any wars he didn't do anything dangerous uh he you know the economy was ticking along there was nothing outrageous he did he really for all his rhetoric he was a pretty conventional uh conservative apart from he didn't buy the neocon uh worldview this sort of imperialist American um worldview where you know it's not only you know in 911 it was um and I mean I I regret myself I fell for all of that and I was all rah for Iraq which I bitterly regret and and now I'm very cynical about the lies that I was told and bought then and I hear now um from the same people and uh so I think that that that that Trump just didn't buy into that whole project it's America first it's more the isolationist streak um and you know he would ask uh NATO why why aren't you pulling your weight why aren't the Europeans paying for their own military why are we having to be the policemen of the world um why can't we have a decent relationship with Russia I mean it's just upending uh you know Decades of sort of Cold War mentality which has never gone away I mean like he upended the like he upended the Palestine narrative with regards to the Abraham Accords exactly you know and all for the good really well that was something yes fresh thinking there and and so I I think that is why he's an existential threat because those people who were the the deepest of the neocon deep State really loathed him and you see that in I mean the CIA letter uh by the 51 former intelligence officials is very um very instructive the the uh that was a letter that was written just a few days after our story came out and was suppressed and it was designed we know uh to help Joe Biden in the second debate against Donald Trump in which obviously uh the laptop from hell is going to come up and um we now know thanks to the uh oversight committee now the Republicans are in control um that that letter was organized by Mike Morell who had been a former acting CIA director and was on a promise to be Biden's CIA director so he had a personal motive So when you say it was organized in what way what does that mean exactly that letter so what we also find is that Anthony blinkin now the Secretary of State and a member of Joe Biden's Inner Circle was working for the Biden campaign he phoned Mike Morell uh a day or two or maybe the same day Mel's vague on it um that our story came out and um and Mel said oh he didn't tell me to write the letter but he would not have written the letter if he hadn't had the phone call from uh Anthony blinkin and if Anthony blinkin hadn't sent him a USA Today story which I have no doubt was seeded by the intelligence Community which said that the laptop was Russian disinformation and so Mike Morel then said about calling uh getting 51 former most of them CIA people some like James Clapper who's lied before congress not not exactly an honest broker um he was also R pulled in but there were five former CIA directors or acting CIA directors who signed that letter this was a heavy duty letter and what they said was well the message that it sent was that the laptop and our story therefore were Russian disinformation way they wrote the letter and they try to get out of now was very weasy they they used a language like has all the ear marks which is a we right of of a Russian information operation they used the weight of their previous uh High careers in the CIA um to to basically sign seal and deliver this letter and Mike Morell says in his emails to other people when he's trying to recruit them to sign the letter that um he wants to get in fact he tells John Brennan former CIA director under Obama who had a lot to do with the destabilization of Ukraine he tells John Brennan um uh you know I want to give uh Joe Biden a talking point at the debate you know a way to to how nice yeah well the thing that struck me is so Preposterous about that so you know when that broke I thought well that's a lot of former intelligence officials and you know it's it's hard to imagine that they're all colluded but on the other hand why in the world would the Russians be so thrilled with Trump I mean you had to buy that story right you had to believe that Trump was somehow a natural Ally of Russia and Putin and I mean I know that Trump got along with Putin the same way he got along with the Preposterous leader of North Korea but it certainly didn't seem to me that there was any evidence to suggest that Trump was the natural Ally of Russia and so you had to buy that to believe that the Russians would be so interested in TR that they would go to all this work to produce this you know complex form of unbelievably sophisticated disinformation in the form of a fake laptop from Hunter dropped off in some no account place in Delaware I mean none of that makes any sense unless you know you attribute like super spy capabilities to some genius on the Russian front which strikes me as you know somewhat Preposterous and yet well all 51 of these people signed this document and so everyone find it without without looking at the laptop without asking to have a look at the hard drive without details any due diligence I mean they they had no evidence to say this none and they just they they in fact admitted in the letter they say you know from our vast experience we've ascertained you know this is exactly this has the whole ear marks of a Russian information operation so they they abused their Authority they abused the trust that the American people would have in that Authority and uh and you know it's it's extraordinary to me that um they haven't apologized theyve you know we have tried numerous times I've tried I've you know the I've sent emails I've phoned I've I've called their bosses I've called the think tanks they've um the bosses of the think tanks that they're aligned to um you know every which way we've had other reporters do the same thing and um there's just nothing from them it's just just dead the one guy called David PRI who was a CIA something or other um he went on Fox News and he said he's happy that he did it you know it's it was the right thing to do by what by what standard but because Trump is so evil that every every possible um weapon used against him is justifiable no matter what is that the rationale well that's the subject but no he had some he had some bogus excuse can't even remember it was so flimsy um but uh they you know and I have spoken to someone who um should have signed it had the credentials to sign it um and didn't sign it uh because he felt that it just there was no basis for it he didn't want to be involved in some political he just saw it as a political hit and so that would have been these people are very Savvy I mean you'd expect them to be they're high level CIA analysts and directors you would expect that they would sniff a rat and know that this was political um of course they knew but as you said they felt there was this sort of this this illness that had um was afflicting the intelligence Community um and and all the forers which was that Trump is an existential threat sure that's right you see that you see that in the reaction of people like Harris is that Trump is such a threat that no matter see it's so interesting to me to see this happening because it's happening on multiple fronts like we're told by people continually that we Face existential threats that are such that all the normal rules should be upended by moral people and those normal rules could mean every single one of your constitutional rights which is of course what happened in the coid lockdown which is now a disease that the doctors according to MSNBC are having a difficult time distinguishing from the common cold you know so that's kind of a problem and so we have emergency emergency emergency climate climate change well that's the that's the next one that's the next one it's like climate change is such an emergency that every right thinking person is is terrified into apocalyptic panic and so you don't get to fly and you don't get to have a car and you don't get to leave your city and you don't get to eat meat and and well you know quote we get all the power and of course that has nothing to do with any of this and so you know one of the things that I've come to conclude is that if you're listening to someone who says the crisis is such that your fear justifies my suspension of your civil Liberties then you're talking not to your ally in crisis and an appropriate leader but to a tyrant in sheep's clothing and this is exactly what's happening with the on the Trump front too it's like oh my God he's so dangerous just like climate change and coid that anything goes no matter what because no matter what we do on our side and we're the good guys it can't be nearly as bad as Trump might do at some unspecified point in the future it's like well just about enough of this I mean the story that you unfold and you know we touched on the collusion part of it here at the end it's right again FBI CIA Facebook Twitter conspiring with the Washington Post and the New York Times to subvert what I would say is the is the story of the biggest political scandal in my lifetime like I was around I was young during the Watergate hearings and and the Nixon collapse and that was nothing compared to this as far as I can tell first of all it was you know Nixon had his his hands in a variety of relatively unseemly places but not in as mult spectacularly multi-dimensional manner as this especially not when you factor in the post Hawk Hunter Biden collusion to silence the people who brought it to public attention it's absolutely Beyond Comprehension so how's your book done by the way how many copies has it sold um it's done very well it's sold in hard cover um 200 like I can't remember hundreds of thousands still yeah yeah oh great no it's done very well and then you know there's audio book and um uh ebook has done very well as right so so are there newspapers other than the New York Post that have carried the banner forward in the in the Biden laptop investigation or or no I mean there have been obviously Fox News and conservative um you know online Publications but no um you know I I kept on hoping because I know that there are at least I don't know Washington Post but I know at the New York Times that there are honest journalists um and and some of them have covered aspects of this and so you get glimmers of Truth coming out but um you know for instance it took uh it was about oh March or April um well after Joe Biden was in sconed in the Oval Office in 2021 that the New York Times finally came out and admitted that yeah you know the laptop was real authenticated some of these emails um that was that by the way oh by the way it was the 23rd paragraph of a story that was buried somewhere and and and then and then and then after that of course because the New York Times sets the agenda Washington Post everyone else just tripped over themselves to do similar and they all had this boilerplate paragraph and it was uh there is no evidence that Joe Biden you know was involved or knew anything about what was going okay okay so so let's go let's go down that because we're running out of time here and there's so much more to cover we haven't even covered the details of the business involvement but but let's do that okay so so I'll play Devil's Advocate so so Hunter has been along for the ride with his father but his father is concerned about him and is keeping an eye on him and why not you know offer him a spot on the jet since it's sitting there anyways we get to catch up and you know do family things together and Hunter I like to have Hunter along in my meetings as he gives brings another set of eyes to the situation and if he happens to be doing some business on the side well you know what's the problem with that okay and and I'm arms length from that completely I don't have a clue what's going on and I'm certainly not benefiting from this in any Financial Manner and so like what's the big fuss here everyone I'm just being a good father and you know opening some doors for my son okay so what's wrong with that story what does how is Joe involved and what's the evidence for that as far as you're concerned well first all I mean this is Joe Biden's business this is how he has uh supported his family in a Lavish Way uh lived in deont mansions um and you know put all his kids through schools and all his nephews and nieces and so on um he's run an influence pedaling operation that his family first of all his brothers um ran for him out of Delaware Delaware is a very peculiar State it's like the Lenin of America it has the most opaque corporate um laws you know rules um and uh and practically every corporation in America is headquartered in Delaware that giv tiny state that gives the senator from Delaware this enormous power because he has all these very wealthy companies wanting favors from him also because when he came into the Senate um he was uh clay to be molded by the older Senators there and they felt sorry for him because he was newly widowed and so they took him under his wing he doesn't like to admit this but it was the sort of um racist uh sort of Dixie crat Senators who did that Democrats um and he got these very high futin jobs powerful jobs he was um for many years chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chair of the Senate um uh Judiciary Committee uh therefore Judiciary Committee had power over who became judges um and also in the the Foreign Relations Committee he was wooed very early on by China he went over there as a young Senator um was taken to the equivalent of Martha's Vineyard for a weekend and they filled his head with uh you know propaganda he came back and he was so embarrassingly pro-china that the Weekly Standard had a front page uh just excoriating him and saying he's an embarrassment um and uh and and Joe Biden as this very influential head of the Foreign Relations Committee um in 2001 was instrumental in getting China into the WTO which was a disaster for American manufacturing for the very American working class that Joe Biden purports to care about um uh you know he was very influential with his reluctant Democrat colleagues I think the Republicans were into it but the Democrats weren't Bill Clinton wasn't into it uh so so that was you know Joe Biden for all his non and his clownish behavior and his lies and his the fact that he's he's laughed at uh by people as sort of harmless toly Joe um he did carry a lot of clout and he did make things uh get legislation through for those donors those credit card donors in Delaware that were again to the detriment of uh the little people and um in return he uh you know got cheap houses and his his previous uh less good houses were bought at an inflated price uh as I said his son got jobs at inflated salary and who knows what else uh it it it it worked for him so he had this this influence pedaling operation going on it was in his DNA in Delaware and then when he became vice president and Hunter now comes into the family business he was already a lobbyist in in Washington so that was working um and now Joe starts flying him around the world with him flew him famously to China in 2013 to when when Joe was going to China to do America's uh important business like stop China from aggressing in the South China Sea militarizing those islands stop China stealing America's intellectual property uh and so on and Joe walked away from that meeting with uh you know the Chinese CCP leaders uh with nothing on behalf of America but hunter walked away with uh a 10% in a Chinese firm that um had2 and a half billion dollar okay okay so let's focus on that for a minute so you just laid out you know three concerns of international importance particularly in relationship to the US with regard to China you said Biden came home from that trip empty-handed but his son came home with a substantial business Victory okay so now it seems to me now tell me if I'm wrong well I would say first of all well that shouldn't H have happened regardless of its legal regardless of its legality it's a clear moral hazard right is that while Biden is negotiating with the Chinese on these important Affairs his son shouldn't be negotiating business deals on the same trip especially business deals that benefit the bidens okay so now how if you're a Democrat how do you argue against that proposition like am I missing something here how is that not inappropriate well this is how Joe Biden does it he uses the grief card again um it's always about um you know because his oldest son the apple of his eye tragically died of brain cancer yeah that that um that is overlaid you know we we're told always that that Joe was so devastated that his AIDS didn't dare bring up the case about barisma for instance because that was around that time um you know anytime uh Joe is in hot water you just see this throughout his career what they they bring up uh the tragedy of his wife and daughter dying the tragedy of his son dying later on and you know Joe when he's in trouble I mean I hate to say this because it sounds so awful and maybe I am being too cynical but he will manage to get himself photographed um at church walking through the graveyard with tombstones in the back honestly um I don't want to see that but I see it it just pops up it's so cynical and awful I think it must be perhaps just muscle memory for him now you know he doesn't really mean to do it he just that's the way it works yeah well be care careful careful what you practice yes right yeah right right because you know what's what's first a plan becomes a habit and then it just becomes second nature and then you say well I didn't know it's like yeah you knew once you just forgot there's one more thing I want to delve into I think and I think we should take the time to do it and so and and then of course I would also like to ask you what you've learned since you wrote the book so maybe we'll end with that but can you briefly relatively briefly go through the business dealings that you detail in the book I mean that takes up like two-thirds of the book I mean I know we talked about the excess volume of homemade pornography that's on the laptop but and I would say that's relevant in the moral domain but not in the political domain there's dealings with China there's dealings with Russia there's dealings with Ukraine and that's not all so do you want to walk through some of that well just hit the highlights let's say that's mly there also Kazakhstan Romania the pattern is always the same it's uh these these sort of corrupt countries um they would like to have um for whatever reason it's either oligarchs that need uh the sort of Joe Biden in prata so that they can pressure their own governments to stop investigating them um that that's happened in Romania and in Ukraine uh in Russia it's more there's an oligarch who paid money to uh it was sort of I think it was a money laundering operation I mean it was like $200 million to um buy real estate or parts of real estate in America um and that was through one of the businesses that actually Devon Archer was organizing but there was $3 and a half million that seemed to get skimmed off that and put into an account of um of Hunter and and Devon uh and so and it's just sort of you know the barisma deal they had a couple of China deals that fell over there was there always seemed to be uh whenever they were really with very unsavory people whenever Hunter was you know mixing with these unsavory particularly in China um those people tended to get like arrested or disappear and I wondered I I thought throughout the laptop as I thought about it there always seemed Hunter seemed to have a a guardian angel you know he's Houdini I mean he's still Houdini uh watching over him and of course it would make sense people have told me that the vice president's son would have CIA or intelligence anyway um keeping an eye on what he's doing especially when he's a crack addict um and you know has a hooker problem um that that they would be keeping an eye on him and pulling him out of scrap to save him and we saw that happening in America God knows what happened overseas um and one thing I should say is about Joe's benefiting um I didn't find a lot on the laptop but um you know it's like being a little bit pregnant um and I'm sure there is more and this is what James comr and the oversight committee is looking for and why they're trying to subpoena Joe Biden's personal bank records and hunters and the rest of the families um so I found some evidence that Hunter was paying for Joe's household bills so um there was there was uh you know painting of his um house in Delaware there was air air conditioning new air conditioning for a cottage on the estate um there was a retaining wall um you know new shutters why is it why is it so relevant just out of curiosity um that there is documented evidence that Joe directly benefited financially I mean there's overwhelming evidence that Joe's son who he travels with benefited overwhelmingly financially it's like are we supposed to make the presumption that there's no moral hazard there for the president that his that because it's his son and not him that means it has absolutely nothing to do with him I mean and yet this is a very close-knit family that spend a lot of time together and and that prayed that around to a substantial degree I mean I would regard at Le at least to some degree a favor done for my son as touching on me in a positive manner you know I mean I and am I I I I'm wondering if I've got something wrong there because of course there's the legal issue and that's it's not like that's irrelevant but it would seem to me that given that it's the presidency that there's a broader moral hazard issue here too especially given that we're at war with Russia because of because of Ukraine I mean that's not a little thing the fact that they the Biden family was Tangled Up in Ukraine in all sorts of interesting ways let's put it that way and that we're now at War and and also an extremely expensive War I might add where tens of billions of dollars are being dumped into an unbelievably corrupt country with like no virtually no oversight because if you think there's oversight in Ukraine there's something wrong with your head everyone's known forever that that's a remarkably corrupt country even by Eastern European standards which is really saying something and so why is it that why is it do you think that in order for there to be a real scand there has to be absolutely documented evidence that some of the money that was definitely paid to Hunter by Foreign agents had to be funnel directly to Joe otherwise he's completely innocent we can just go on as if nothing's happening that doesn't strike me as reasonable totally agree I mean it's one of the the narratives that's being crafted to protect him and that is you know the White House has changed from uh Joe saying you know I knew nothing about my son's overseas business dealings to um now they're saying oh Joe wasn't in business with his son um this was after Devon Archer uh testified um and Devon had to be very very careful because he's facing jail himself and he has a lawyer pro bono lawyer who's very close with the bidens so uh he had to be careful in what he said but what he said was that the brand was Joe Biden and that Joe was on the speaker phone with Hunter at least 20 times when they were having the meetings uh you know trying to trying to well if the brand if if the brand wasn't Joe Biden then what the hell was the brand because I don't see any evidence that Hunter Biden had a brand what the New York Times And The Washington Post Etc want is they they're saying oh there has to be a check with uh Joe's name on it signed by a corrupt oligarch for anybody to even open their eyes and say that Joe did something wrong I mean yeah I don't think so that that's that's not something that the people who are investigating that's not a road that the people who are investigating this should walk down the right Road as far as I can tell is to say hey look folks um we're in a really dangerous war with Russia and no one will say we are because we're all winking and nodding and pretending that it's Ukraine but it we know what the hell's going on fundamentally and there's some chance that part of the reason that we're in this war is because things that weren't exactly straight were going on with the president's son yeah and you know Victor shoken blames he blames Joe Biden for some reason Obama outsourced foreign policy to Joe Biden no idea why but that's what he did uh Joe Biden was the guy standing in the tarmac when XI jingping arrived in America Joe Biden was the guy who went to Ukraine you know I don't know seven or eight times uh and and I mean the ukrainians even were a bit insulted that Obama didn't bother ever going to Ukraine so so Victor shoken blames Joe Biden the vice president for Ukraine not being able to defend itself when Russia invaded Crimea and of course Russia invaded Crimea as a direct result in retaliation for that uh you know alleged um CIA coup that threw out yanukovich who was kind of moderately friendly to the Russians but wasn't kind of in their pocket um yanuk had been talking about doing a deal with Europe um which obviously the Russians didn't like and he pulled out of and the Russians gave him a big bribe blah blah blah but but the fact is that that a lot of ukrainians Victor shoken being one of them say that they were told at that time and poroshenko told shoken this that the Americans and that means Biden said look don't do anything we are going to deal with this diplomatically well they didn't deal with it diplomatically I don't know what whether whether I mean Bob Gates the previous um uh you know high-ranking Bush and then Obama um Secretary of Defense said that Joe Biden's been wrong about every for foreign policy issue ever and I don't know whether that's because he's a bumbling fool or whether it's because he's compromised in some fashion he always puts his own interests first and so uh now we have a situation where Russia was so demonized and and completely falsely during the Trump Administration where the whole Russia Russia Russia hoax was happening and and people like Adam Schiff the senior Democrat head of the intelligence committee was boldly saying that that Donald Trump was an agent of Vladimir Putin he was a Russian agent none of that was true but it sort of does a job of demonizing Russia uh in the eyes of the American people and you know I mean Russia is completely to BL for having invaded Ukraine this time but um Putin would have seen an opportunity because of course the last time Joe Biden was in charge of policy for Ukraine uh they invaded Crimea and nothing happened so um I I just think it's a very dangerous situation where you have this this guy who has to be compromised considering all the pies that his family was in and all the millions of dollars that flowed through to his son and his brother and various other family members um from all these different countries that are our adversaries um you know how can Joe Biden not be compromised well that's a good place to end I would say we're going to do another half an hour everyone who's watching and listening on the dailywire plus platform I'm I don't know exactly what I'm what I'm going to talk to Miranda about when we get there but you can come over there and find out and for all of you who are watching and listening you know thank you very much for that Miranda that's uh that's quite the book laptop from hell for those of you again who are watching listening you might want to go read that and you know draw your own conclusions because this is uh it's something you should be investigating and thinking about especially because there's an election upcoming in a you know about a year and it's going to be an important one and because things are quite the mess and they could easily get worse and you might want to know what the hell's going on um so let's sum up well what do we see here well Hunter left his laptop very carelessly a week before his father announced his run for presidency three water loged laptops just in case one wasn't enough and so that's three is quite a lot actually and then a guy who really had no public exposure at all and no desire for it coton on to what was on the laptop and tried to get it to the relevant authorities and and that was difficult as it turned out even though he went to the press and you'd think they'd be all over it and he finally got juliani interested and juliani got the New York Post interested and then that story broke soon before the previous election date and then it was shut down and it was shut down because of fascist collusion between Facebook Twitter and the Deep State fundamentally and it was blamed on Russia collusion and then 51 former security and intelligence officials wrote a letter stating that this had all the earmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign even though they'd never seen it they didn't investigate it and that was all a lie and that was just before the election which was a which was decided by hair and after that Trump claimed that the election was stolen he claimed it at a level of detail but I don't know what a sensible person is supposed to think about the fact that the two biggest social media empires in the world shut down the New York Post story devastating the Biden family on the grounds of the laptop that Hunter himself left at a Delaware computer repair shop that's where we're at all right we'll see everybody on the daily wire side thank you very much Miranda much [Music] appreciated
