do you think Theo's Gonna Cancel me do you think Theo's gonna come after come after me getting a job in Tech whoa Theo calmed down I'm not even ready look at the feels like [Laughter] I'm sorry I don't know what happened I don't know what happened I just really got into that for a second it felt right in the moment okay getting a job in Tech has always been hard but man it's rough right now it doesn't matter how long you've been in the field you could be brand new or 10 years in still is a lot weirder than it used to be let's talk a bit about the market and how you can be sure you land your next job so I do want to say one thing that is a touch different right now which is that when I did 10 years ago interviewing and to 15 years ago interviewing that time period every single interview involved six back-to-back data structures questions not Lee code style but like genuine just data structure questions like hey I need to organize this and these things change what do you use and program it for me so it's like I'm making a priority queue I'm making a heap on the spot right it just feels like it was a lot different back then I've done binary search I've done Heap uh gosh I've done a lot of tree level stuff I've done a lot of graph searching right it was very very straightforward kind of like things very little practicality but it shows that you know kind of like these data structures and in theory if you know data structures and you can program data structures you're probably at least a moderate level programmer um I think that's probably fair to say for the layoff started there was so much opportunity companies were making new teams and expanding them stocks were going up job I do feel like though there was a lot of opportunity it was still not easy to get a job because now you got we kind of shifted especially in the last few years we've shifted into this culture where it's like I want to make sure you're a good fit and so sometimes you just like lose a job and they said you weren't a good fit and you're just like I don't even know what that means like what what why am I not a good fit and you try to ask for questions and it's just like they don't give you good answers they don't give you you know anything that you can actually be actionable other than you're awkward and people don't like your face and you're just like well that doesn't make me you know I don't necessarily really feel that great when someone tells me my face is awkward it just it hurts me a little bit jobs were plentiful generally it used to feel like there were more roles than there were people and hiring the right person for the job was hard because of that we were more willing to hire less qualified people we could take someone in who might not be quite ready for the role but if we could get them there in six months to a year that was better than desperately fighting to find the right person and so that's never been Netflix's approach in general uh Netflix is kind of just approaches always to try to get the best talent because we would rather spend three months finding the right person than spending uh you know two weeks finding someone that could become the right person and the hard part about becoming the right person is that there's also like an inherent bet there right you are inherently betting that the future contains a better version of the current person that's very hard that's like a that's a big time bet but I know there's a lot of companies that did that just not on Netflix we never there's no betting there's no like oh maybe one day you'll be good enough like right we it was it was uh it was definitely not easy I'll put it that way and is that wrong do I feel bad about that I don't think I actually feel bad about that it was really nice honestly it was really nice because every time I saw someone through the doors of Netflix I knew they were a lights out engineer that's kind of like my general thought process so it didn't matter who I was working with my fundamental operating capacity was that they were awesome and I think that there's something that does happen when you get that opportunity you know and if it didn't work out you can find something that works for them and if you can't you can let them go because of that this ratio here of people who are qualified for jobs and hunting for them compared to the number of available roles generally resulted in more opportunity it was still hard to get in especially as a junior because if you weren't qualified then you had to convince the company you could be or they had to convince themselves it was worth taking someone less qualified that's changed and that's changed for two big reasons those reasons are both of these bars so first adjustment we need to make is the number of jobs available budgets and stocks are plummeting and head count is getting slashed as a result so I would say at most half the roles that were available last year still are so I so I mean I would say this is a little bit more symptom oriented orienting right uh the problem was I mean for me at least what I observe is that the problem here is that all these companies got this especially internet companies they got this really intense amount of just internet traffic from 2021 through part of 2022 and so they grew as if this is the new normal and then when those normals stop being the normal and they kind of went back towards uh like the 20 you know pre-pandemic 2020 uh 2019 levels then it's not that the stocks fell therefore we cut head count it's that the you know it's it's that the the net income fell therefore our stock is falling and therefore to improve our like our gross margins we need to reduce head count we need the higher less and so it's more of a derivative effect I would say than just simply stock stocks don't just fall for no reason they fall because the projected growth was not met and that's the reality is if you don't if if you plan on growth like 2021 it's just not going to happen in the internet day and age this you know right now but is it going to happen over the next five years yeah probably the new roles appearing and being hired for are going down huge companies like Microsoft and Amazon are doing full-on hiring freezes what they're also doing is laying people off and what that does is it increases the size of this section now we have people who are very qualified some people in this box have been working for 10 plus years and just due to the structure of the company are now out of a gig there are more yeah that Google one where the guy was like 20 years at Google and then they just fired his ass without even like letting him know it's just his email quit working dude that deserves such an apology like if someone's been working at a place for 20 years they get a little bit of heads up you have like a nice little party for them you do the right thing right you send them off and just say like hey the roll is leaving you've been here for so long not only do you get Severance but we're gonna give you like you know these next few weeks to kind of tie some stuff up Do the Right Stuff I'm sorry this is happening hey go for an internal transfer if you can find one you know like you make room because the person's obviously been greatly successful make room for them that's how I I mean that's personally how I think it's it's best done that's that does happen at Netflix we've had people with whom teams have just had to go away but we give them you know we give them heads up we give them the time to look internally for another position see if any other team actually wants them managers help reach out like just try to do the right thing I think as a company in general is is always good but I I understand there's also a scale problem you know the difference between Netflix and Google is about 80 fold right Netflix has a thousand Engineers 2 000 Engineers somewhere right in there it's like we don't we're not huge right we're not a huge company Google's like got 80 000 Engineers right it's just simple differences uh the fire the the fiance let's see the finance person probably saw the dude making a ton of money and overreacting laid them off right away yeah probably you're probably right it just turned into some crap like that where there was no context this person makes too much get them out say Netflix again now more people looking for jobs more qualified people looking for jobs and there are less jobs available this ratio flip sucks so hard because there was so much room in this range here this section between the number of qualified people available and the number of roles this is where the opportunity was to break into the market to get a job you might not be qualified yet for I do think that I mean obviously he's just you know free handing some of these things uh okay Netflix sorry uh but I I think there's still more available roles than people who can fill them it's just getting yourself in the in front of the right people I think a lot of right now what's happening is that people don't have budget for two roles they have budget for one rule now and so they're being more picky I think that's really where the problem comes down to is I don't have a lot of head count room so we better make the right hire or to get your first gig out of college this section doesn't exist anymore it's just gone because the number of qualified job Hunters has gone up a lot and the number of roles has gone down a lot it just absolutely sucks but if you understand how these roles are filled there are still ways in let's talk a bit about that let's say this is the I am excited about this because uh you know I I don't I don't make decisions at a company to hire I'm the person that I do a few interviews a week I'm doing an interview here uh in two hours for a candidate you know so I have a good insight into what makes a successful interview but I don't know why or what people why we choose what we choose so I'll be curious available jobs bar we're gonna go down top to bottom and see how this gets cut up as roles get filled so I'm a team we have five roles available at our company what do we do first first thing so we look internally always start the hunt internal team transferring will fill so we never do that uh one reason why we don't do this this internal thing this this this Hunt is because I mean in general at least from my perspective this causes a bit of contention because then you have teams constantly trying to like fish other people out because when you leave a team you leave a hole and so I think that that can be difficult I've never looked first for a team transfer uh for promotions this makes a lot of sense like hey who do we want to promote who do we want to have some sort of benefit let's find and see if the right person is available for that have they outgrown their team that I totally get but just any old transfer over ah I think that can be hard I think that's a definitely a per company kind of basis I guess if your company's completely fine with that then it makes total sense well a lot of roles especially right now because some teams might be getting folded so if I'm at a company and I'm working on ads let's say we're hiring more people on our ads team and there are three other teams that just started doing twitch ads am I right am I right doing layoffs rather than immediately starting to hire outside makes a lot of sense to look at the company see who's getting laid off whose roles in this next quarter can I snag some of those people previously team transfers would fill a lot of roles at companies now it's way more though because the number of teams and the number of total rolls is going down so team transfers are now taking up a increasingly big chunk of roles being filled I can totally buy that especially like if you're reducing your roles and they're still open rolls you obviously just want to reduce the people that you think were the best you just want them to side shift over and just take those roles that makes that makes total sense that makes total sense after team transfers we don't immediately go to posting online though usually the next step is going to be referrals referrals have always made up a large portion of roles being filled but now almost exclusively all my jobs have been referrals or interpersonal stuff my only one that wasn't was Prime I mean Prime Netflix and prime prime time prime time that I I did that one myself but uh Netflix was the only one that I had no internal referral it was completely I don't know what happened my brain just totally just [ __ ] the bed and I don't know what happened there but yeah that's the only one way more than ever if you have a friend who worked at Google who just got laid off you have another friend who just got out of college recently which one makes more sense to refer let's be honest and this is no shade to recent grads I've worked with so many incredible people but if I'm a company making a decision right now and I have the choice between someone fresh out of college who's never worked the Google company before or someone who just got laid off from Google they're gonna jump in front of the new grads and this once again hurts people without as much experience because you don't have the same opportunities to get a referral as others do previously referrals were a lot but now that everyone has a friend who's been laid off everyone has a friend who could fill the role next to them so if you're in the industry and you do have available roles on your team the likelihood you know people who could fill those roles is way higher than it's ever been and the result this does work it works less at bigger companies for sure so if you're trying to get a job at Google or you're trying to get a job at Netflix like my referral only means so much it it you will get a bit of a fast track and that you'll get someone looking at your resume right away get looking at your socials looking at whatever you provide you know uh pretty much whatever right like they will do that but it doesn't guarantee anything whereas if you're at a smaller company referrals contain significantly more weight because often smaller companies they don't have you know they don't have a dedicated you know hiring Talent department and so referrals just like they're they save little companies from having to pay enormous amounts of money you know what uh yeah my referral my I mean my referral doesn't necessarily mean a lot and picks should shut up he is an artist little section left over that is what's left for recruiting yeah so of the way smaller number of available jobs which as we've seen here is way less you have half the available jobs you lose a bunch to team transfers which are happening more than they've ever happened before you're losing more to referrals which are happening more than they've ever happened before and what you're left with is this tiny little bit that is recruiting and this is why so many companies are shrinking their recruiting teams as well because yep the few my wonderful cousin Kristen I love her a lot she's great uh yeah she I mean she's she's been she's been in recruiting and a lot of this stuff has happened it's kind of wild she you know she's definitely she's seen some stuff because these last couple years they're crazy it's crazy time out there rolls left are getting filled more easily this is where you would break in as a new grad and this is where you would break in as someone who doesn't have connections in the field so how does this compare to the way things used to be well it's not looking great the reason that we saw so much advice around applying to every job possible heading up every company you could sending your applications in on every website you could find and I still think that's a good that's still good advice that will always be good advice is to do everything you physically can to go out there and get something right that that's always sound advice but you should always strive for referrals like do stuff in open source do stuff uh in ways in which you're making friends like you know build in public do whatever you can to show what you can do because you just need more eyes you know what I mean that's working on your Elite code interview stuff that all happens here the way you win here is stuff like cold applications University degrees leak code skills and generally grit and resilience yeah the way you would get in in this path is by trying really hard and that was kind of how it was meant to work because the people who got in here who we weren't as confident in because if you came in through a referral or through a transfer we're pretty confident you know what you're doing but if you come in this way we're not so we need to know you can work really hard probably too hard and do things that make no sense because we told you to and that's why leap code is still used for this style of interview because if you're willing to sit there and learn something as silly as lead code you're probably going to be willing to sit there and spin whatever gear is your job to play with and that's why Google still does leap code interviews that's actually a really good take I would say that that might be Theo's greatest take right there which is how do you vet as somebody who is hiring someone you have never met before and we all have different takes on this we all have different ways in which we think I personally think just hearing someone that uses I know that's gonna sound ridiculous uses Vim or uses uh Helix uses NYX OS uses any of those things and can talk about it to me it's just like they're so willing to go learn and so willing to learn really weird things that learning things is just not a big obstacle for them they're willing to put in the time and so I always put those as a plus one but you know I've never really thought about it from the lead code perspective like if you can take the time and learn all these dumb things you can really learn anything you want next fixes yep at the next fix yeah we need to make sure that if you're on this side that you'll get qualified fast enough to do well so if you come in through this side they're gonna make you what the f is next OS uh guitar sorry you're not going to get hired jump through some hoops so they know you're willing to level up in the ways they're looking for however that's not how it works anymore and this advice is no longer great because this only helps if you're in this section and this section is way smaller and the number of people trying to get a job this way is just as high as it ever has been so this path sucks now what works on the team transfer and referral side this is where the stuff we like comes in a lot OSS contributions are a huge one if you're involved in open source and you're contributing absolutely a lot of the other people who are in open source still have jobs it might even be a places that are still hiring and if you're remembered as the person who fixed that bug into your PC and I work at a company that's using trpc and we need a new engineer you might be the first person to come to mind as a result of that open source is a huge way to get in this way more so though is communities I know a lot of people who have gotten jobs just from hanging out in my Discord and meeting people that way I've personally yeah yeah that that's happened that definitely happens being in discords especially being in a bunch of uh being in a bunch of programmer discords is is a great way to network which also really good side thing here which is don't be a weirdo in Discord you know there's a i every about once a week I have to ban someone from Discord it just happens because y'all some people just take the djenning too hard too fast too swiftly they don't apply the coconut oil they don't slide in okay they kick down the door and just just say the most ridiculous stuff and then you get you get your ass kicked out you don't want to be known as that guy right you want to actually help yourself you know being weird is not that cool okay there's a certain level of weird that is cool that's not that's not it you know the guy that's really cool is that guy that can do like hacky sack really well that's that's kind of weird but you know it totally works out you know it's not cool the guy that's like dude I'm totally into death you're like that's weird that's a weird kind of weird I don't know if I want to be in that kind of weird like I don't think what do you mean you're totally into death man like you're gonna murder my children you know like there's there's a handful of people who stood out in the Discord that they were involved in I keep an eye on a lot of the channels and the people who are in the questions Channel answering questions the best and the most I keep a mental net and when I need to hire if I ever need someone to help with Community Management engineering project those people are the top of my list just honestly I literally do the same thing if Benny ever asked for a job I would help him I would refer to him to the Moon you know I mean if shy Ryan ever asked for a job I would refer to refer him to the Moon you know what I mean if if pick ever asked for a job I would probably hide my children hide my wives hide my husband because pick's gonna use Nick's all Nick's OS everywhere it's crazy okay these communities you're proving to me that you're pretty qualified and if I had the choice between someone who hangs out on my Discord and someone who went to Harvard but never put anything on their GitHub I'm picking the person in this community every single time I agree with that get involved I don't like the Harvard honestly I've never had great experience with people with really high pedigrees honestly I've never had great experiences all my experiences with people with high pedigrees have always been some some level of superiority right like when they when they fail it's like learned helplessness and when they succeed it's like I am truly the best and it's just something about that has all I've just never had a great experience um I prefer I personally I if I had my way I just wouldn't hire anybody uh I wouldn't actively hire people from Harvard I would need someone to tell me that they're good right if someone came in and said I'm from Harvard as that is the centerpiece for the reason I would say no but uh I don't I don't look at resumes for this exact reason because I prefer to uh try to judge people in a more clear and clean way and so I usually do a nice little interview question and I hope you know things go well also this one's generally the case it doesn't matter as much on the recruiting side but it matters a lot here impact I'm keeping it vague attention means so many different things I mean that helped me fix my Prisma deployment or it can mean you're the person who kept your company's code base from falling apart an example of this is mine with me if they went to Harvard and never built the system for mod view where we can just drag and drop widgets all over the place and other teams were using similar stuff in particular the Creator team for the dashboard so I started working with that team to share code and a lot of the stuff I did impacted them and helped them build a better project that impact was what led to me switching over to their team in the future when you have impact you make an impression you take up part of somebody's mind the next time they're looking to bring someone onto their team you're high up on that list and that the hard part about this is that you can have a lot of impact but people's memories are short and so it's about impact consistency both internal or external you know like if you did that one really great thing people may remember that one really great thing but they may not remember it was you is it do I find it hard rejecting candidates always I I cannot help but to look at every single candidate as if it were myself I I hate it it just feels the worst every single time I even say leaning no destroys me on the inside for this exact reason that's the way to think of this side it's not about how can you prove you know what you're doing it's how can you be on the mind of the person who might be hiring in the future because your goal is to get them at the start of their hiring process not at the end ideally if you're looking for a job someone will hit you up about a job before they even post it online because you come to mind before Greenhouse does and before LinkedIn does the goal here is to be at the top of the mind of the people who could be hiring and if you are there and you are someone that the people hiring think about you're going to have jobs coming in left and right the front door approach here where you walk there's also a middle ground I don't think which is really stated a lot here having a good LinkedIn does really help since I made my LinkedIn a meme I've gotten virtually no more recruiting emails but I was getting like maybe one or two a day uh and then I made mine a meme and within like a week they just all just disappeared overnight and so having a really good LinkedIn is really good it's it it is very very helpful having a lot of ways in which you state exactly how you've achieved things will do nothing but help you uh get people's eyes because you know that green spot you're right the Green Spot may have gotten smaller to what amount but it's still a great search engine people use it to find you know to find stuff up and say hey I think I'm qualified for this you're my qualifications good job front door is closing fast the good clear online presence I think is really a big takeaway here because OSS contributions that's an online presence communities that's an online presence impact that's an online presence LinkedIn that's an online presence right I think taking that stuff seriously is always a good plan when you're on Twitter and you're about to say some of the stupidest [ __ ] you've ever said in your lifetime take step back you know think about how this affects you okay just take you know this is not a comment just small moment this was a path for a long time and I think a lot of the advice online is focused around this path because of how reliable it wasn't because it was the majority of jobs for a long time if I looked at 100 jobs 70 of them used to be filled this way which is why it made a lot of sense to recommend this path that's not the case anymore though now it's going to be less than 25 at best I would argue I never throw around statistics Theo I know Theo knows not to throw around statistics but he feels it's small what he's trying to say is it's extremely small in comparison right it's it feels like less than half would be a charitable way to read that uh as as to what percent I have no idea right now on Netflix we have many open jobs we're just waiting we're trying to get people to fill them all right so it's like yeah you know there's still that green is still big you are going to be filled in this way the jobs that were able to be filled in this generic way have been destroyed the harsh reality is people on this side will always be safe if you're making impact you're part of these communities and you're making cool stuff happen totally agree you will get noticed and you will succeed I'm not saying that everyone can do this and I'm not saying it's easy to do this is hard it's really hard it's not even the path that I personally took but there are so many awesome people in the community who are taking this path right now and are absolutely killing it yep doing them a disservice telling you to go this way especially now that this path is less sure than it's ever been in a world where the cold applications were the way most jobs were filled that advice made sense but that's not how the world works anymore I'm curious what the actual percentage of this is like what is the actual percentage of cold reaching out recruiting versus referrals and team transfers I actually I have no idea right considerate of that as you hunt for your friends I don't know what the actual thing is make some impact do some cool stuff and you'll be surprised what opportunities start to appear even if you haven't been laid off there's a lot to think about right now I have a is going to pop up over there friends always watch videos don't get laid off be a friend for those who have been those watching this video don't have a job at all quit yet this should be a very helpful day you want to say something now okay and then like my video and then subscribe and then hey look that's me you don't even know Jason then give me a nice look and then subscribe to me on with Amazon twitch Prime all right um but real talk real honest honest to gosh Real Talk uh the greatest thing you can do as a developer the greatest way that you're going to be successful is always going to come down to a singular a singular item there's nothing better that's going to help you which is Theo did mention it grit determination willpower however you want to look at it there is one group of people that are always going to be successful and those are people that when no happens four times they go for five when no happens five times they go for six right uh who is it Tony finau uh Tony Fino he said uh we're all losers and winners are just simply losers who kept losing until they won right like that's it that's the difference between a loser and a winner and I actually really liked that uh definition which is like you just don't you just don't continuously win I don't subscribe to very much on my side Channel this is side Channel Dog side Channel I don't like to subscribe because I'm trying to get different videos I'm trying to like separate out my two accounts so I can get different ones to find you know what I mean um and I think a lot of times people kind of uh mess that up you know what I mean what uh what to do when you have bad social skills I've talked about this a lot it's always the same answer you just kind of you gotta get out there I know there's some people who are literally incapable I've met one or I've met one person in my entire lifetime who I have who I think is genuinely incapable of social skills um really there's only one person there's this other person his name was Nate and he was in college and I would say he's probably the person that I've met that had the most amount of autism I've I have personally witnessed while still being able to go to college and he was really quiet very very shut in and we would sit at lunch with him and kind of bring him in try to like make him to be a part of stuff I remember sitting at lunch with him when he had no one else to sit just went and sat down by him because you know you got to make sure everybody feel like they have a friend and that kid by the end of the year was one of the most social people probably having the most physical hurdles out of anyone I've ever met and he still became the person going out talking to new people he gained the confidence he gained the ability he gained friendship and community and how important is that so if you're suffering from social skills finding a good Community is a great way to kind of get past level one social skills now you may never become a great right we we can't all become that great person I don't think I'm that great at it I think there's plenty of times I either say too much or too little I don't remember facts I'm bad at names there's plenty of things that I suck at and I recognize this and I really do try to change him in every single time I'm like I'm gonna remember some names I'm gonna be like you know like in the beginning Frank Underwood in the very first couple episodes before the whole Kevin Spacey thing happened I remember he said something where he's like I never forget a name and I thought I only forget names right like it's good advice I'm gonna try to be that guy I I just can't I've tried so many times and guess what I'm gonna do tomorrow I'm gonna try again I'm gonna try to be that guy I'm gonna try every single time when I meet somebody I try to think of all the different reasons of what they do and I try to map it out my brain and I try the best I can uh you know we all have deficits and should just be okay with it and try to do the you know the best you can that's all so social skills I think social skills some level is trainable some level not not the entire thing but some amount was trainable for sure a lot of people overreact their uh their social anxiety and the solution is that to the touching grass but there are people out there that genuinely suffer from the issue yeah there's I mean I like I said I I still think of Nate Nate being probably somebody who has had one of the largest like one of the larger barriers I've ever met when I sat down with him he could make eye contact he couldn't talk to me he couldn't put it together like a really full good sentence but he was just like such a nice kid why not why not bring him along hey we're going we're gonna go do this come along Nate right he had he had nobody else and guess what like it changed his life having Community makes a huge difference and unfortunately in that situation he needs someone to come in and bring him up right and that does happen and if you're a very social person you see someone you know like that take the time if you're not a social person you want to conquer that try it try talking to somebody you don't know try to talk to somebody that you that looks lonely you never know you might find out that they're totally a cool person and you guys can become friends you know real talk
