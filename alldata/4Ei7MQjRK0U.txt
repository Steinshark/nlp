ultimately like we don't currently operate on two layers we have several Emeco like prime cursive brain layer which is where all of our kind of impulses or coming from it's sort of like we've got we've got like a monkey brain with a computer stuck on it that's that's the human brain and a lot of our impulses and everything are driven by the monkey brain and the the computer of the cortex is constantly trying to make the Montek monkey brain happy it's not the cortex that's steering the monkey range the monkey brains during the cortex you know the cortex is the part that tells the story of the whole thing so we convince ourselves it's it's more interesting than just the monkey brain the cortex just like what we call like human intelligence you know so it's like that's like the advanced computer relative to other creatures like the creatures do not have either really that they don't have the computer or they have a very weak computer relative to humans but but it's just it's like it sort of seems like surely the really smart thing should control the dumb thing but actually I don't think it rolls this one thing so do you think some of the same kind of machine learning methods whether that's natural language processing applications are going to be applied for the communication between the Machine and the brain in to learn how to do certain things like movement of the body how to process visual stimuli and so on do you see the value of using machine learning to understand the language of the two-way communication with the brain yeah absolutely I mean we're a neural net and that you know AI is basically neural net so it's like digital neural net will interface with biological neural net and hopefully bring us along for the ride yeah but the vast majority about of our of our intelligence will be digital there's a like so like things like the difference in intelligence between your cortex and limbic system is gigantic your allylic system really has no comprehension of what the hell the cortex is doing you know it's just literally hungry you know or tired or angry or sexy or something you know that's an ADD just and then it that communicates that's that impulse to use the cortex and tails the cortex to go satisfy that then love a great deal like a massive amount of thinking like truly stupendous mal thinking has gone into sex without purpose without provocation without procreation which which is actually quite a silly action in the absence of procreation it's bit silly the one why you doing it because it makes the limbic system happy that's why that's why but it's pretty absurd really well the whole of existence is pretty absurd in some kind of sense yeah but I mean this does a lot of computation has gone into how can I do more of that with the procreation not even being a factor this is I think a very important area of research by NSFW an agency that should receive a lot of funding especially after this decision if I propose the formation of a new agency boy but people generally like the fact that they have Olympic system and a cortex I've met anyone who wants to lead either one of them like a girl keeping both that's cool Olympic systems kind of fun tell us what the fun is absolutely and then you people generally don't lose the cortex either I still like having the cortex and the limbic system yeah and and then there's a tertiary layer which will be digital super intelligence and I think there's room for optimism given that the cortex the cortex is very intelligent and limbic system is not and yet they work together well perhaps they can be a tertiary layer where digital super intelligence lies and that that will be vastly more intelligent than the cortex but still coexist peacefully and in the end of an EIN manner with the cortex and limbic system you
