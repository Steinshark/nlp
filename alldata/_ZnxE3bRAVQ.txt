python is so in demand i mean i would venture to 
say it's one of the most in-demand programming   languages right now and not only for software 
engineers but also for data scientists different   uh analysts there's so many places that python is 
used so many different roles and i think that's   why it is so in demand with python 2 another thing 
that is important to note is it's very easy to   ramp up on it's probably if not the most easiest 
language to learn and i'm saying not necessarily   as you go deeper and deeper in it but to start 
with if you're looking to pick up a programming   language for any role really or just want to get 
familiar with code i always say python is a great   place to start hi friends today we are going to 
be going through some of the top python projects   that you can build these are real world python 
projects and i think it's really important to have   some python projects in your portfolio especially 
if you are going for a software developer role   or a data scientist role because one thing it 
will really do especially if they're a real world   project is show not only your skills of python 
but also how you can step outside of the box and   build some really cool things as someone who has 
interviewed people for different developer roles   one thing i always look for is when they are 
sharing about their projects when their eyes   light up that moment of excitement when they go 
yeah i built this and this is what i was doing   it for i was trying to solve this problem and it 
just makes you feel more connected to the person   you are interviewing and i always remember those 
are the interviewees that stood out to me if you   haven't already make sure to hit that subscribe 
button for more tech and coding related videos   leave in the comments other topics you want me to 
cover coding career personal you know the drill   i'm here to give you information and to to help 
build your tech career okay let's get started we are doing the add portion of this video also 
before we get into this video i want to say a huge   shout out to file stack for sponsoring this video 
for your next project you are going to be building   if you want to stand out and have something 
really a really interesting talking point i really   suggest you check out file uploader it's the 
number one developer service for file uploads so   you can get user content from anywhere and improve 
file and video uploads with a powerful and very   easy to integrate api another thing i love about 
file stack it has a beautiful ui with over 20   integrated sources not to mention uploads are 100 
times not 10 not 20 not 3 100 times more reliable   with their content ingestion network cin also they 
are secure transfer to handle the most sensitive   files so you don't need to worry about security 
they got you covered we have file stack one of   my favorite things when i was playing around with 
it and putting it into some of my projects is the   friendly ui for your users so not only is it 
simple to integrate on the back end side of   things and use the api but also the end result 
what your users will see is so user friendly   and i think that's something that's missing in so 
many different services so to have it both easy to   implement from a developer point of view but also 
to from a end user point of view i just think is   huge i've linked file stack down below so make 
sure to click on them sign up and check them out the first project i want to talk about and it's 
a project i actually recently did for fun was   building a discord bot this is a really great 
project because a it has a very easy ramp up so   depending i mean regardless of how familiar 
you are with python whether you are a newbie   or you are experienced this is a project 
that can easily be spun up by you you can   easily make it there is strong documentation 
on how to do this to build a bot for discord   but the other thing it does too which is really 
interesting is it is a very big conversation piece   in your portfolio so for me recently i'll link 
it down below as well but i made a discord bot   it was when it was a few weeks ago when 
everyone was talking about elon musk   and how he was talking about the bots on twitter 
and just kept on using the word bot and it got   in my head so i made an elon musk discord bot 
and it sounds kind of silly it was really fun   though and i think it's something that whatever 
world event is going on or whatever you're   passionate about you can show in your portfolio 
how you made this discord bot when you're making   a discord bot it also does a few things for 
your learnings which i think is really key and   really shows how you can use python and it shows 
that in your portfolio so one of course you are   learning how to handle events the other is you are 
learning to accept commands validate assumptions   and also you are learning to interact with various 
discord apis so it's a really great project   to to build because you're really it shows 
different parts of python that you are able   to work with it shows you're able to work with 
different apis and really shows a good range of   skill sets the next on the list which is another 
one i recently built i've been going down this   whole wormhole with python recently because it's 
such a fun programming language to build really   cool kind of small projects with and i just i'm a 
huge tinkerer is that the word tinkerer i like to   build things build really cool things and python's 
a great place to do that for so the next on the   list was building hangman and this is such a fun 
project to build it's a project that will really   teach you and reinforce uh loops in python uh 
functions in python and it also uses the uh what   is it the random module is it the random module 
yes the random module so it's nice you get to work   with um a random or the random module not a random 
module let me say and the other thing it does too   is there are so many great tutorials online for 
python hangman that it's a really great way to   follow along on these tutorials get comfortable 
with it and then build your own version of that   and this is a really great game to add to your 
portfolio because obviously it's a good talking   piece it's different but the key here is when you 
are building this make sure you build your own   version of it so yes i mentioned there are tons 
of great tutorials online which is always good   to follow especially as you are learning out but 
for your final version build your own version of   it and this will do a really great thing when 
you are getting interviewed and you have it   in your portfolio because part of explaining your 
process of building hangman you can say you built   you followed along with different tutorials but 
you saw these areas that could be improved on   and this is how you've done that and it really 
shows that you are willing to uh take initiative   solve problems and make the code better make code 
better by making it your own and i think that's a   really interesting thing to do so hangman is it 
was one of the heart it was really hard honestly   for me at first just to wrap my head around it 
but once you do that and you do some tutorials   it's a really fun project to make okay next on 
my list which i haven't made for a long time   but is mad libs and this is a game if you're not 
familiar with mad libs it's a game in which you   are writing a story with words missing in it and 
you can ask another player to fill in the blanks   and it just makes this really funny story and this 
is a fun project to do and also too it's one of   those projects that once you build it you're going 
to be like call your mom you're like mom i built   mad libs like it's a really fun project to do and 
it's something that most people are familiar with   as well when you are building mad libs so it 
does you learn a few things one is end-to-end   development of building a python game you also 
learn basic input and output implementation so   it's a really good beginners game to build and to 
feel like you've really accomplished something by   building this game that most people are familiar 
with and as a side note i will link all the   tutorials or versions of all these tutorials down 
below as i mentioned there are tons of them online   but i really encourage you to try it yourself if 
you need to then learn with the tutorial learn   with the tutorial but your final version make 
sure that's your own make sure that something   unique that you can bring to the table and as i 
mentioned in the past game it really is cool to   see how people light up when they're talking about 
projects and how they solve something you know i   was following this mad libs tutorial and i saw 
how this code could be improved so this is why   i did it this way and it sounds so small and it's 
often forgot about i think in interviews but it's   so important to really bring that to the table 
because it shows so much more than what it may   appear to you you know it shows that you're 
leadership you're taking initiative you're   a problem solver and the list goes on i know i'm 
harping on this but it's because it's so important   next on the list is to build an alarm clock and 
this is a really fun one and what this one does   too is you not only get to work with python but 
also the graphical user interface and this is   a great way to add another layer to a project and 
really show your skills while making a real world   project one thing i think about this project that 
is a really fun idea to do is because this can be   built in so many different ways like many of the 
projects we are speaking about but specifically   the alarm clock you know from the user interface 
to how the code is written one thing i think is a   really cool overarching project to do is to build 
it but in multiple ways and this is a fun thing   to do you can have them all in one folder and 
really showcase how you built the alarm clock   with different methods and different uh ways you 
structured your code and different user interfaces   and what this does is it shows that you're it 
makes the alarm clock go from a small project   to quite a large project and it's interesting too 
for an interviewer to see how you can code in so   many different ways and solve problems in many 
different ways and also speak to hey i think this   is the best way i built this and this is why and 
it makes for more of a conversational piece and   that's something i haven't seen a lot of people 
do i'm kind of thinking as i'm speaking because   i think i should do something like that that's a 
really fun idea so i challenge you to make this   python alarm clock but in many different ways 
and have them all in one area and and make it   really a fun talking piece okay the last one i am 
going to speak about and this is definitely more   intermediate to i would say even advanced in my 
opinion is to make a tetris game this is something   i challenged myself to do a while back and i'm 
sure by the time this video is posted i will have   posted the video on my tetris game in python 
and it was so much fun to build honestly like   i don't i'm not someone who just codes in 
my free time for fun a lot of the time you   know i'm either coding for youtube for work uh 
for if i'm helping a friend out for something   but just to code to code is you know i'm already 
coding so much so many hours of the day that i   don't just after work code code but with this 
one i did and it was so fun and i just really   wanted to challenge myself and see it come to 
life i followed a tutorial for it but it was   just i learned so much about python and i highly 
recommend checking it out i'll link down below   my video on it and the tutorial i followed because 
it was a great project and you can kind of make it   your own and and modify the code and modify the 
colors and you know to whatever degree you want   but it's a really fun project and it definitely 
is more advanced so i would say or compared to   the other ones we are speaking about but it's 
a really solid piece to add to your portfolio   okay those are the top projects for beginners 
learning python or wanting to learn python   to really stand out and make your resume stand out 
along with talking about the top projects to build   i really hope through this video not only did you 
take away learning about some of the top python   projects to build real world projects to build 
but also to some tips that will really help you   stand out because at the end of the day that's 
what we are here to do in an interview is stand   out thank you all for watching i hope you enjoyed 
this and i will see you all soon thanks everyone look at me i am somebody
