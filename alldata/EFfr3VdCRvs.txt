I absolutely loved it and I wanted to read it cuz I got to like right here and I said oh this is so good this is such a good tweet so we're going to read this together okay the saying nobody ever got fired uh for IBM or for buying IBM is at its Essence about risk management the traditional wisdom goes that if you buy from a big company you're going to be safe it may be more expensive but big company projects uh project an image of stability and reliability so buy their Wares is seen as a prudent Choice except it isn't certainly not anymore meta killing workspace is merely exhibit it should have used 42069 okay ride the memes people ride the memes any company that hits their way into workplace I okay so first off what is workplace what is this workplace business does anyone know what workplace is it's a slack but it's slack but Facebook okay so it's slack but Facebook Okay okay so any company that hitched their wagon into workplace just got served with an eviction notice in about a year the data will go read only and shortly after that it's game over now companies from Spotify to McDonald's along with millions of others have to scramble to find an alternative that's crazy by the way it is crazy that Facebook got into this game sold it to large companies and it was just like and we done simply because meta can't be bothered to maintain a platform that's merely used by millions when their C consumer business is used by billions it's true right rug pulled yeah dude this is a crazy rug pole this is a crazy rug pole should have stuck with Microsoft I know I can't even believe I'm saying this relying on meta for your business is bold it is bold but apparently McDonald's and Spotify did well I mean but this is like the this is conventional wisdom I actually completely agree with this idea that this is I mean dude can I just say this this is react in a nutshell okay yes we're we're we're going to relate this to react so everybody sit down and shut the hell up we're relating this to react okay think about this for a second I cannot tell you how many projects that I've been a part of starting at Netflix where they say if you don't use react you're going against the grain right like this is kind of that mentality you always use the safe option cuz the safe option is always the best option never take risks never go into the unknown oh man won't be able to hire for this and you're just like yo dog I'm just using spelt like it is it really unhirable you're telling me that that is an unhirable technology that's crazy talk that's like absolute crazy talk to think that that is an unhirable situation whereas react uh is just somehow magically hirable I just find this kind of stuff just so nuts and for me this is like the this is the business version of use use react right you find big company big giant successful company with many billions of dollars buy their product you get rug pole uh this is right let's see this right here is a risk of buying anything from Big Tech like meta and Google their main ad based cash cows are so fantastically profitable that whether it's millions of paying customers on work workplace or millions of live websites once hosted by Google domains it all just pales in comparison this is true when when when your company literally lives off of one item the rest can be murdered it's true and the thing is is so someone said I have fought to and they to get hmx into the current product atwork here's the best part about this whole thing every person that doesn't do react easily uses HTM X htx is a simple simple transition so you like have many communities all together or just this one Niche web Community right and react is a niche Comm Community because there's tons of different remember development isn't just react it's huge there are more devs that don't program the web than program the web not anymore no it is most certainly Theo disagrees and Theo's completely wrong on this one there is like entire industries that don't do it including all the back ends I mean Theo can be wrong on this one I'm wrong on Plenty of things it's just saying saying someone is wrong is just blah blah it's just the point of view right who cares right like there's first off there's an entire backend that just has nothing to do with react they don't care there's ml an entire thing machine learning just nothing to do with react every single point of embedded from cars all the way to your alarm clock nothing to do with react compilers languages operating systems like that's everything there is so much more than just the web mobile apps tons of mobile apps and then not to mention the entire gaming industry which virtually uses very little react they typically use Lua for their uis I understand that react native is used in mobile apps but there's plenty of mobile apps that do not use react native okay sorry I just I'm just letting you know that the world is a little bit larger than just react okay it's just a little bit larger I know this is difficult it's just like there's this weird there's this weird like idea that people have that the center of the universe is web programming and specifically front-end web programming at least that would be the perspective a lot of people would have on the front end uh or at least on Twitter right like there's the the the center of the world is the front end/ full stacker and then there's like a bunch of periphery stuff that kind of doesn't really exist and it's actually the other way around there's a bunch of just isolated silos that exist everywhere and that's that yeah battlef menu's UI is somehow written in react yeah not surprising I know that react has made it into a couple games but lot of people are just using Lua I know a lot of games use Lua just because it's good I mean this one the Google domains thing like that's crazy it's just pales into comparison and is thus one strategy rotation away from being labeled non-core and killed off like this is just you know I did I didn't actually come into this thinking that I was going to re reate relate this to react use react all you want I don't really care about that okay that's not the point the point is don't think of it as the center of the universe or as always the safe Choice it's not always the safe Choice every new version of react is a bet a bet on the unknown you're hoping it's the right choice but the reality is is that if you've been doing anything long enough you know that the current Trend today which has been made up in the last two years often is fraught with difficulty in five years that's like the best take the best takeaway you can possibly have buying from Big isn't the sure bet they want you to believe buy from someone who actually needs your business to make the wheels go around this is so good I mean honestly he has campfire right so dhh has campfire which is like a slack competitor which is vastly cheaper like 99% cheaper than slack but they need your business right they want your business they are profitable and they need your uh they need your business which means that they're there to serve you not you serve them you are not a data play right like that's the big thing is these data plays Gmail data play you think that you think they're making Handover fist money on being able to parse the emails or you think they're making Handover fist money on people buying business accounts like that's not why they're doing it people okay they don't make the money off of you buy a business plan okay they make the money off of the data they get just something to think about you know I I I just I just loved this tweet I love this tweet we're liking it I'm retweeting this one I think it's fantastic and I think that we because I I most certainly had this myopic vision for a long time so I I don't blame anyone and there's I know right now there's a couple people in chat that think I'm a complete [ __ ] it's okay like that's totally cool I'm not my my feel my fies are not hurt this is just my experience of the world now in my 20 years maybe I have seen some things and maybe in your x amount of years whether that's 20 maybe that's more maybe that's less you've seen things that are probably counter to what I've seen and that's okay and you can use react all you want because maybe you've used it a certain and specific way and it works really really well for you and the team you've built because the reality is one last thing that's super important it is better to choose technology that you and your team are highly proficient at than choosing a technology that everybody uses okay so if that is ginger templates and python Ginger template and python that up okay if it's PHP girl go PHP that is the best way to be successful so if it's react it's react and if you're worried about being able to hire people I I right now is a hire Market okay you get to choose who you hire now this is not some crazy fight over devs or anything the next couple years my guess are going to be the ball is in the hiring Court wages might go down you'll get more remote work opportunities but as remote work goes up wages are going to naturally go down because you don't have to have that Silicon Valley expected living in experience there's lots of things that are going to happen it is going to change vastly right now I think the biggest worry is just producing quality products and being able to maintain that quality product for enough years for you to become successful and and earn the money like that's going to be your biggest thing it's not going to be hiring I just doubt doubt doubt doubt doubt hiring is going to be a problem the name I like this tweet I I liked and retweeted this tweet a Jen
