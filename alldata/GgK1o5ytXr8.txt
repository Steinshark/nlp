want to spice up your gaming setup look no further than Tick Tock they've got thousands no millions of videos that show you how to create the best setup around it's just that some of them are better than others fear not though we're gonna take one for the team and test out the best tech hacks starting with this one from Janelle and Kate with over 883 000 likes why no why why no no we're not no it's tick tock Linus you need the views oh God they make it look easy also you're not doing anywhere near enough look at how much they have up there well I mean that seems like a lot look Alex I don't think there's any right way to do this but there is the right way to tell you about our sponsor vrla Tech they sent over their Helios gaming PC and it's a freaking Beast we're talking core I9 3900 KF GeForce RTX 4080 64 gigs of RAM and 5 terabytes of storage if that isn't what you're after you can completely customize your system on their website which we're going to have linked down below I'm going to go ahead and say that this Tick Tock exists only to laugh at you because you ruined your keyboard remember there's no wrong way to do this do you think I need more glue well she has it between all the function keys and stuff too I have it between the function keys Alex again I cannot emphasize this enough there's no correct way to do this so that's some nice glitter really fine yeah it's really nice uh I need the next step in the instructions ah it's everywhere and she said to tap the glue will protect it I think [Music] oh no yeah that's exactly what I thought was gonna happen that's so bad yeah um it looks somewhat oh nailed it I rate this Tech Tick Tock zero out of ten and I sincerely hope this is the worst one we're doing today as a YouTube Native I've got to say coming over to tick tock there are some really fascinating videos where they're clearly designed just to keep the viewers attention even if nothing of value is being added but not everything on Tick Tock is intentionally bad some of it's just bad like this monitor painting video from nikolski that's not you don't want that on here that's wait wipe down the screen wait she's not going to paint the actual panel is she the real way to do this Tick Tock is to take the actual monitor itself off of the stand disassemble it which should take no more than five to ten minutes with most standard monitors paint it then put it back together you may have noticed this monitor got a little bit mangled in a previous video we should still be able to get it apart and back together so the only thing that this affects for what we're doing today is that you may actually have an easier time getting things apart than I am this is Linus Tech tips not Linus talk ticks beautiful one thing she got right was shaking up the paint can something she got wrong was her work area you always want to be in a well ventilated workspace when you're working with paint or really any other aerosols ideally she should have been outside definitely not in her bedroom although the paint fumes could be good for creativity uh I do not want to get paint on this always important keep the can moving you're far better off doing more light coats than fewer heavy coats in terms of getting a decent finish why kid go wrong oh look at that for the best results you should follow the guide we did a few years ago where you disassembled the monitor sand Prime paint and clear coat for a professional finish but if all you want is a quick way to change the color of your display this will do the trick or if you don't like painting at all there's an alternative as shown by tick tocker flex and Flora and you can use vinyl for a lot more as shown by Eden DIYs this is one we don't even need to try out to give it an eight or maybe even a 9 out of 10 because it's something that we've been doing for years here's the table in our build corner which has a marble vinyl wrap over top of it and I bet most of you didn't even notice as you can see it's not the most durable thing in the world and you get you know Nicks and scratches and scuffs all over it compared to an actual marble countertop but unlike a marble countertop when you get sick of it or if it gets too scuffed up you can just peel it off and redo it the video is a little weird though you notice the audio was just explaining a feature of Tick Tock it had nothing to do with the hack whatsoever did you know you don't have to tap the profile picture to get to the person's profile all you have to do is swipe left they gotta edit these things really you don't have enough attention span for me to talk about and show the same thing at the same time what about vinyl on your computer though if this video from Grim collection is anything to go by it can look sick oh and we've got two different kinds of film here we are looking at either mirror or rainbow I really really want to do rainbow social media person says that you know the mirror is more true to the original I want to see Rainbow it's not as rainbowy as I was hoping yeah I was really hoping for a lot more rainbow it's more like your aunt's shower yeah oh okay hold on a second oh there we go okay all right it's in uh okay so I actually have never applied one of these before that's it that's all you guys are giving me our sponsor vrla tech asked to be included in the tick tock hacks uh I suspect ruining their side panel was not what they had in mind it's a perfectly nice computer already and this probably isn't necessary I mean you know I'm kind of I'm kind of getting it oh gosh uh oh crap you got this I put it on the wrong side we're a little short here and to think without Tick Tock I wouldn't be having all this fun Tick Tock middle-aged man struggles to apply rainbow vinyls I am not middle-aged yet just cut out all the other stuff and show this that was a test fit uh now we're gonna put water on the surface and on the vinyl to show you how it's done properly [Applause] we were seeing how many of you are going to comment before actually watching the whole video here we go and oh that came off a little bit there that's okay wow I think that might be our first ever 10 out of 10. vla tech offers loads of options on their site with different fans coolers gpus RAM storage Etc the standard Helios comes in the o11 dynamic so it's a larger build but they sent it over in the air mini because that's the kind of thing you can do you can have Intel or AMD ddr4 ddr5 they give you all the options and they have very competitive pricing they not only have gaming PCs but they have workstations as well so whether it's for work or play there is something for everyone and if there's something that you want that is not listed on the site they're still happy to install custom parts for the customer they just need to let customer service know and they will take care of it the 200 customers who use code Linus can get a hundred dollars off their PC from vrla Tech using the link down below if you're not satisfied with tape just on your monitor and computer though tidal bomb has got you this mouse apparently is the best one for drag clicking according to competitive mine Crafters I had to steal this from Maria and that's a thing competitive mine crafting I guess so okay the cone XP where's our tape at before you do this see how fast you can click without it I was able to get 53 that was my record 53 without this right there's no way I can do 53. I was a drummer for many years ah I'm not gonna do it oh my God I'm not entirely sure I even understand oh I'm gonna have paint glitter and gold Sharpie on my fingers by the end of this what are we sure gold Sharpie has the same as silver Sharpie I have a silver one upstairs oh whoa are you doing it what 11.6 clicks per second dang it actually works I just need to dry more I don't know I actually tried this for like 45 minutes yesterday and couldn't get it and now it's just working okay this is another nine out of ten this is a sick sick hack you might have noticed that up until now other than applying a couple of stickers we haven't really de-landified our setup but don't worry we're going to show you that now in The Tick Tock way by not showing you at all okay look our monitor's back actually looks not bad for a 20-minute job I mean it didn't do anything for the waviness let's see how it compares to our tick-tockers version oh I don't know if you're getting info but you're oh oh no oh no oh oh you should not use rubbing alcohol on a screen what another ten ours is way better our next Tick Tock hack is sort of the opposite of what we've done so far the silent reviewer shows us rather than how to apply stickers to things how to remove them but he's using hand sanitizer and the benefit is that it won't have any smell I think the last one that they used was like mineral oil or medicated oil so I mean it would be an improvement over that but I would think we would just use yeah 99 isopropyl alcohol either way we're going to give the hand sanitizer a shot who knows maybe this is an outstanding Tick Tock hack we've got some residue over here uh what when we pull off uh let's pull off a sticker and then we'll do half of the residue with isopropyl and we'll do half of it with hand sanitizer this is actually the perfect example of the kind of thing that you'd want to remove with this method overall pretty good sticker came off okay but there's definitely some residue all right here we go hand sanitizer man if you don't want residue you obviously shouldn't be using hand sanitizer yes they have alcohol in them but they're also full of like you know aloe and scents and things that people want to keep their hands from getting dry as opposed to just alcohol In fairness though that did work reasonably well the question is just if you're trying to put alcohol on something where'd it go why not just put alcohol on something holy Alex no it's not it isn't no it's not better it's not better what's in you purified water carbamart glycerin oh interesting that actually works great it could just be as simple as having a thicker consistency making it so that the alcohol doesn't just evaporate away so quickly and almost gives you like a little bit more scrubbing power um but it legitimately works better all right eight out of ten eight out of ten I can't believe it not what I was expecting let's see what we've got next Carter PCS who I follow I have no idea who this is but hey I'm not complaining can these Birds please shut up I'm doing he's talking into a lint moment but anyway if anyone from LTT is watching this a few things I should mention uh first of all I am very against cable ties which might be sacrilegious Atlantis Media Group but you know teams zip tiled away and second of all I know Linus loves Brown switch wait what hold on who's this guy think he is against against cable ties Pro zip ties Linus we get to play a game do we unfollow him now oh the power's in your hands hold on I haven't watched the rest of this okay hold on you know come to think of it this video is just meant to say thank you for the follow and I just gave him like four reasons to unfollow me I'm so stupid okay hold on okay Alex do you want to take the other side sure I right Carter PC you're welcome for the follow but you're kind of on the chopping block here you've given us a lot of reasons to unfollow you doesn't like Cherry Browns actually that's not that controversial these days I'm not going to count that hey cable ties though very upset cannot count gave two reasons to unfollow says he gave four absolutely this this right here this is bad cannot count it means we can't count on you why did we follow in the first place I actually have no idea he referred to us as Michael Jordan I didn't hear that that wasn't a different Tick Tock but he referred to you and Jay's two cents as Michael Jordan I hate it when Bonafide Tech YouTubers come to tick tock like Jay's two sensor Linus or scatterful for example see I'm a youth basketball coach and I'm teaching these nine-year-olds you know elbow in flick your wrist blah blah blah and then Michael Jordan walks into the gym and starts telling these kids like okay you should also do this this and this that's Michael Jordan I learned from him alright that's a neutral that's a neutral right there good content though for Tech talk all right he keeps the follow he keeps the follow next up we've got several products that you need to buy which are definitely real things that this person actually uses and not just Amazon affiliate bait five helpful gadgets from Amazon did we actually buy that thing for your Zoom meetings with one touch you're able to mute and unmute and open and close the video you do not need a dedicated buttons no you don't want why are you putting a sticker on there like that organized it's going to rub against the bottom of your thing next is this portable charger with three built-in cables and you can plug this directly into the wall to charge what even was that that I just looked at this one we actually got oh good it doesn't charge your airpods wait it doesn't oh no no I don't see contacts I thought that your case went on it just holds your air pods wouldn't it also just deplete the battery because it would still be connected when it's in that yeah no I think they should go into standby also these are going to get lost five sure like there's no way I don't need an iPhone and airpods to know that an airpods holder that doesn't charge your airpods stupid rechargeable hand warmer for gamers I've been just 30 seconds and no we're not going to use hot water because don't do that instead because don't do because don't do that why not instead here's a cheap hand warmer that you can buy on Amazon and it's really cheap as well oh good a cheap hand warmer that is really cheap as well is this only 20 bucks and two pieces yeah uh five thousand milliamp hours even just as a as a battery Bank this might make sense assuming that capacity is real it's getting warm I can feel the current flowing Alex I'm giving this one a two out of 10. if you're a real gamer you know how to warm your hands like that now it's time for some software hacks do this so your friends think you are hacking do not need to full screen that okay and I don't need this audio huh that's just a list of the directories on the computer I really love this one because it's so much worse than just going to hacker typer and also so much more difficult well we're supposed to do it right yep why do you change the color again color a okay oh I spelled color the uh Canadian way whoops wow I'm hacking I'm hacking the Mainframe the real way to do this is to go to hackertyper.com and start hacker typing tell me you're a hacker without telling me you're a hacker I want to read this New York Times article but it requires a paid account change.com to.com dot slash and yell I'm in shut up does this actually work is it that easy because I've been like going into incognito mode and then just switching to my mobile network anytime I need to read something I honestly haven't verified this because it's so easy and so stupid if it just works just a period just put a period in there is that it that can't be right no no not work that didn't work I'm not surprised but I am disappointed they apparently have patched this zero out of ten hack fun fact about Samsung phones hold on a second I can get a picture of a chihuahua on my phone hold on a second hold on so this is life-changing asterisk pound zero asterisk pound whoa whoa hold on how do I get the dog I want the dog and you click the image test oh I got the dog yeah I think that's pretty useful Okay so we've got like a QC menu like a diagnostic menu on my Samsung phone I have never accessed this before I'm giving this one a solid eight and a half I Like It Black now with a hundred percent more oh God how do I how do I get out of oh my lock button's not even doing anything I'm downgrading you this is now a six out of ten hack try at your own risk oh hold on emergency SOS what the no stop stop I like it eight and a half out of ten hi I'm Caitlin's party data privacy and protection expert and I want to show you what Google knows let's go you're gonna type in this website at settings.google.com let's go oh I should do it on my phone then hey Okay add topics for you vehicle parts and accessories games role-playing games massively multiplayer online games minimal theme Here Motor Vehicles home audio and video laptop computers industrial goods and Manufacturing video game consoles mobile phones accessories shooter games web design and development web hosting and flashlight apps okay we probably don't need flashlight apps how about you it's got to be more car stuff than me what I found interesting in mine is that it's completely different from my work to my personal account right like personal account it's like incomes high for some reason my other one is like medium high okay they both think I'm a homeowner which isn't true small employer small employer yeah oh like that you work for yeah oh okay ouch mail 35 to 44. oh my God bracket now Mary High income bachelor's degree nope not enough industry to figure out my info and thinks I work for a large employer nice you know I think the takeaway is you can tell them which information you want them to have which is nice and finally a customer of ours brought us a gaming PC and told us that it's having some issues this is a repair shop gamertech Toronto FPS after booting into Call of Duty I did notice some FPS drops and couple stutters generally when this happens the first thing you want to do is look for any graphics driver updates when you're updating your graphics drivers don't click the express installation click custom and click this clean install this is going to completely remove your old graphics driver from the system and reinstall the new one since the customer well this is a pretty good uh this is a pretty good pack of video games we're going to try doing a bios update this is pretty good Tech advice yeah this is really good yeah nine out of ten ten out of 10. update your drivers your bios great work the part that got me about this one was that someone brought their PC into a tech repair shop to update their drivers oh yeah oh yeah that man you'd be surprised if you guys enjoyed this video you might also enjoy Tick Tock hacks part one which had worse ones I think uh uh pretty debatable
