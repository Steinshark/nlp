for almost two years matt here has coordinated the procurement for everyone else's intel extreme tech upgrades always the bridesmaid never the bride well not today because it's finally time we are giving matt a 5 000 tech makeover he's got a core i5 he's got an rtx graphics card he's got a turntable speaker system and an ipad what is this oh there you go but also bribery to ensure that i won't dig around too much and find all the stolen goods two bite brownies is this actually part of the upgrade no just for you they're not really too bad [Music] i i'm gonna dig around i'm gonna find everything i'm pretty sure there's sound bars from the office you have to find a tag don't you i'm sure you're smart enough to take off the tags but i am damn sure that this thing's from the office even better yet it is it just never was inventoried but then i still bought it off it was never inventoried it was an extra right before i started they sent two of the exact same ones and one went into a video according to jamie and the other one didn't so you did me a favor is what you're saying yeah a man of culture i see when you walk into a house and you see a wii sensor bar you know they're a true gamer wow that's a pretty good wii game collection too i love it this is awesome definitely not bootleg this one no that one was just a reasonable coffee we have a lot of extras because we have two copies of wii fit how fit do you need to be not fit at all because we don't have the sensor bar here that we don't have the board anymore but the bigger thing is that this was my wii which i have still the memory card in here for the gamecube games but i also homebrewed it so i had like the occasional n64 game on there which doesn't matter anymore because of nintendo switch online oh yeah it's a good service nintendo switch online it feels more right doing it the broken way than doing it the paid way this fridge is almost certainly stolen i don't know if anyone would actually buy one of these dyson things that's got to be from the office no i bought it oh when you don't have ac you kind of get desperate and when it's app-controlled it's even better you know they have fans they have a thing in the middle that goes like this yeah but that one matches the floors better it's all about the aesthetics i can't tell if you're serious right now oh no i'm 100 serious we bought this one simply for the fact that it has the like the formaldehyde detection because it's the fancier one well that's cool okay that's not what you said before what you said before was that it matched the floor but that was the main reason that was the first one not gonna lie i think you're mostly clean these you green cables are almost certainly stolen from the office amazon purchase really yep okay that one is obviously it's got an asset tag on it so i've been loaning this one because i want to purchase one and now i have an actual one that's on pre-order and it's just hiding in this bag wait it's on pre-order or it's in a bag nope there's this exact one coming but this one is unfortunately from the office the blue colorway you'll see is a theme very soon are you going to play for us uh probably in the exclusive in the exclusive yeah because i used to play in a band for about six years wow okay and they're still running strong back home in winnipeg and so they gave you the boot hey i kind of left them they thought i was going solo no [Laughter] one thing i noticed when we were back in the study there isn't a computer we're replacing no there's just a brand new build happening because when i first applied for this job i typed up my entire resume using dex because my laptop just died there's an old video back where we had what do the people at lmg use in between intel upgrades my running joke was my whole pc is the xbox because it has edge on it i see okay so up until then it was simply a usb-c cable as you saw with a dongle with a mouse and keyboard running decks that got me to this point we could do better where are we going to set up to build we could either use this table or that table depends where you want to sit where i want to sit yeah oh you think i'm building the computer i'd like some assistance i put the ass in assistance sit down you know what i think i like best about math setup it's like the fu fanboys setup you're rocking android you got ipad os you got windows pcs nintendo playstation xbox you just don't give a  do you it's a matter of where the games are and eventually getting the money to go get them and yet you've never built a gaming computer hey you like a manual that's what we do with manuals right uh well hold on a second you've got a lot of things going wrong here this place looks so nice i'm gonna try not to destroy it today that's gonna be one of the themes of today's extreme tech upgrade we did a test build uh me and dan about a week ago just to make sure everything would fit you do a lot of talking and not a lot of building look how red you are are you really that nervous yeah this one is one of the freshest ones off the board and i'm pretty excited for it because it's literally the only board you can get one of two that you can get that is ddr4 and itx in 12th gen so as a consumer you are sol um good old prairie talk there if you mess it up because it's either this or an asrock board got it you're still talking and not building now you want 12 600k that's a pretty gaming focus chip are you planning to do any kind of content creation or anything like that or just straight gaming it's going to be a mostly gaming there are times when i want to edit some pictures and then occasionally make some sort of montage i used to edit all the videos for our band whenever we were on stage with my phone so i'd shoot it with my phone and then edit with my phone with adobe rush nice i think i would spend hours just going i think six peak course four e-course should be lots for what you're gonna be doing then i am so nervous you look like you've been drinking like you got that rosy i was never one for pressure even though i would be on stage all the time but at the same time this just is way worse than memorizing songs have you breathed yet while you work on ssd and ram we've got a one terabyte p5 plus along with 32 gigs of crucial ballistics i'll do the hard part of the build okay i'll put the ipad oh actually you do have a hard part if you want to put the ipad pro together oh from your lovely friends at dbrand [Music] dbrand says you've got to go to their site for the installation instructions but you know what i have to say to that hd brand i'm gonna do it yolo style because this isn't my ipad anyway and i don't care this board has two ssd slots which is half the reason why i bought it so that i could use this one terabyte now and then upgrade to a two down the line so i'm guessing just hide the one terabyte in the back here and then that way i can keep this one out front and open so i don't have to totally take the motherboard out yes that is definitely what i would do z690 is going to be pcie gen4 on both of those ssd slots anyway so you're not giving up anything by using a a lesser slot because this is a gen 4 ssd i mean if you really want it to be tricky you could do the side rails i don't know if i care about that okay you guys can judge my application are you sure there's an m.2 slot back here there was supposed to be unless it was double layered up here uh there's no m tau two slot back here wow so it even looks like an m2 slot have you been spinning your wheels this entire time okay you did manage to put the ram sticks in oh it's double stacked i said i wasn't going to build it for him but boy are we ever getting dangerously close to it's time to build it for him this is a cool color funny thing is when this case came out i had a great idea for the whole colorway of my entire build that i wanted to do and then dave2d did it about two weeks later of course he did i'm like well there's the blueprint after all the times you've been blamed for compatibility issues and other people's extremetech upgrades what are the odds that yours is going to have compatibility problems uh i can tell you one right away my pci gen 4 cable never ships so we have to boot this without the gpu to start oh but that's the only thing that's pretty minor you think this is going to fit uh yeah we did a test build you did a test build remember we have one of these at the office so we kind of use that as the demo so you're sure it will all fit yep i want to see this cooler fit this is an aio and the case is aio compatible there's just two ways it can go ek's ai o is a little bulkier than your typical aio like look at this thing so we can either go side mount and then just go normal gpu or we could go vertical mount gpu skip the whole gen 4 riser cable we want to go vertical mount gpu if we go vertical mount gpu then we have to boot into gen 3 and then that's a whole issue that's not a hassle that's fine and then that way it kind of looks cool if we do it the normal way then the pump's in the right order because otherwise the rad can either go in one or two spots either along the side here yeah or down here in the bottom which we did the test build with if you want the cool look of the gpu vertically mounted on the side then i think it's fine to put the wrap in the bottom um rad screws are here yep and then the separate 12th gen bracket is tucked away in the box as well because unlike everybody else's build i made sure to grab the bracket which was in a nice big pile of bags next to the aios and they were right there the whole time did you just blame other people for your confusing procurement no i didn't put the boxes next to the other one but i did mention to everybody else who has been using this to go down and ask for the bracket i'm specifically looking at you sarah you called me out i'm coming right back by clearing the air and saying it was not my fault it still is compatible you just forgot the one bag and now i'm vindicated with what a fan favorite sarah is that's going to cause some heat i don't think anyone's going to be taking your side no one knows who i am where i came from or what they do how's it going it's uh it's going good you know how they say to always cable manage your setup they uh always forget to tell you how much of a hassle it is when you have to take it apart right now i have my power bar on the opposite side of the actual holder because it was too thick and it's about to fall on my face as soon as i take off this ltt cable tie because the screw i need is right behind it this is not the fault of the ltt cable tie user error user error oh man i got all distracted and i ended up took the screws out of the one i've already installed dang it as you can see i am helping a lot i am going just as slow as you now i don't know what it is it's cursed what does this even screw into also it stinks oh matt yeah in this case yeah does the vertical gpu just hang out there yeah i think it just hangs out there that can't be right yeah it literally just says to insert into the pcie slot and then insert into the gpu and call it a day well thank goodness i got a small gpu that is absolutely wild also i'm a little less concerned about the horrible horrible tubing routing i realized once we've got our gpu in here we're not going to see any of that this is great would you go with 360 ti yup very nice very nice 1440p gaming right there everyone was like oh but you're not going to see the rgb off of the aio and then to that i say neon strip hopefully this is cool the case has two different spots where you can put the power supply bracket depending on whether you have an sfx that's what we've got here with the 92 millimeter fan or an sfx l power supply the longer one that uses a 120 millimeter fan and what's nice about that for us is that instead of having the power supply down lower like this where the modular cables are very likely to interfere with our thick fan on the radiator down here we can just move it up and that'll buy us some extra space which we really need you're gonna love the colorway i guarantee it oh i do love the colors this is amazing how cute is that i don't know quite how this happened but i think i'm just about done suddenly there's an entire pc in front of me now this is gonna go in man you gotta line up these little tabs at the bottom come on buddy ah there you go there you go little buddy you know what i bet i could get those top fans in there without even the covers let's go for it one of the main purchases that i did as part of this upgrade was this andover audio spin base turntable speaker okay so tell me this were you into vinyl records before it got all trendy recently or are you a bandwagon hopper 50 50. no pick a lane my dad always had a stash just chilling in there that's your dad that's not you he kept showing me them but we never had a record player of our own to actually start listening to them again and it was the same for miranda as well and the cool part about this is that they've designed a way so that you can have your whole speaker resting on your stand and then your record player will go right on top and now you have speaker out here speaker out from here and a speaker up from here it'll give you 270 degree audio and one very nice knob to use now i'll confess something in spite of the recent trend i have not listened to a vinyl record since i was a small child and my aunt or my dad or someone put one on for me and i went wow it's like a big cd that sounds crappier i issue then to you this challenge convert me let's hear it okay let's do a comparison then in the meantime i've got an update for you guys i wanted this sfxl spot here but what i realized is this top fan is actually interfering with the power cable when i have it plugged in here so what i'm going to try and do is without disturbing anything else i'm going to try and unhook this scooch it down one and screw it back in which will hopefully give me enough clearance ready one two three yes success and both of these fans will spin okay we'll work on that okay i think i've probably heard enough that i can now listen to that i think the best thing i can say about the record sound quality is that i can't really tell the difference matt what are you doing yeah i'm cleaning the record because i wait what that's not a controlled before and after a piece of fuzz landed on it okay i get your argument for digital now but still it takes this long to play a song look if it helps at all matt probably half of the audience out there is siding with you right now what about the other half the other half is like this is the stupidest thing ever yeah yeah yeah that would be probably the other half dude it's skipping there is a skip on the disc it's right at the seam of the color it will hit so i always skip this song it's proving his point i know i don't want to be that guy but i think your old speaker sounded better definitely better bass here um but those sound really good the one thing about these old speakers is the fact that they ruined the aesthetic of the living room there's not much for neon green here other than gregory i'm so disappointed right now really this what we're going with this because it looks better you go to all the trouble to get actual gigantic music pancakes because of the so-called sound yep and then you're like no i would rather use an inferior speaker because it looks better there is eq on the back consolation prize what the hell is this i have no idea how i'm gonna manage to flatten this enough to get that pop-on panel in there okay i lied i have some idea just apply more force oh that's kind of neat it's just symmetrical so you could actually get two of these and you could put them on both sides if you really wanted to um you know how you say not to close the side panel oh do you think there's a space along the top oh i see uh it could be done quick update the desk is now a desk and i just need to fix the monitor arm because it's set too deep because my old desk was a lot deeper than this one and we'll quickly hang up some posters and we'll be good for the computer okay that seems good enough right not bad let's take it in you're letting ploof be a bad influence on you you got the vinyls now you got the fancy goofy keyboard cable why is this such a trend back in my day we hid cables we didn't want to see them you kids today you have the privilege of wireless interfaces that are literally faster than a wire and you go and you put wires all over it how you kids make it out in here pretty good well okay that's that's fair i walked into that i mean you did you walked into the world who is this nothing a color is this a bit a mouse pad did you see the color of the keyboard or the cables i guess we don't really have anything in this color scheme we need more colors i know you we had a white one in development i don't know this uh yeah rubberized backing doesn't it doesn't doesn't quite go up to snuff but you don't want to fix the ltt grade it's harder to move now but that won't be the only keyboard on here you're gonna have more than one keyboard i'm going to pull a proof right now i will have two keyboards on my desk you want to see the second keyboard i mean i guess what choice do i have you're gonna show it to me keyboard number two it's a roland it's a rollin i am getting these speakers wired up mackie cr3s you've seen the bluetooth versions in nicole's video and you will see the same white bluetooth versions in jeff's videos so make sure you're subscribed for that as well he will be doing a very well themed pc build is this like the new generation of kick me post-its okay what do you think is it gonna power on first try oh crap oh power needs to be on oh you're one of those psychos who unplugs or turns off power bars yay it's up whoa all ram is detected got that 4.5 gigahertz frequency i feel like we've missed some stuff though we've got some philips hue bulbs to add and this backpack oh okay a gopro lens hold on reach inside the cavern that's the main ticket oh so i picked up the hero 10 black and then you also picked up a zve10 camera what is this boy for so this one uh you probably saw this in plus video as well it is pretty much a point-and-shoot it has a little auto-focus button here to help de-blur your background uh because i'm still learning how to use an actual camera and not just my phone it's also really good because you can just plug it in on usb c and use it as a webcam or stream cam cool now it's time for the part of this extreme tech upgrade where we have the big transformation we're going from the old tcl tv to the sony x90j movie magic okay we went from a 65-inch black mirror to a 65-inch black mirror but this one's way better while the old stolen from the office model was a 4k set this one will do 4k 120 hertz and with sony's markedly better image processing now i couldn't help noticing that the stand for the tv doesn't really fit on this glass tempered glass doodad you've got here no and that's the sad part is that this is part of it there's no way to take it off or anything so we will have to cheat the soundbar a little bit for the sake of this oh wow tv security we're good okay okay i mean it kind of looks like it's hovering there it actually sort of works it looks kind of like it's it's already got kind of a tiered foot design on it anyway yeah i think it kind of works okay and now the tv is actually resting on the stand i love that we didn't have to wall mount the tv today wow i mean obviously we cheated it a little in the editing but that really was the easiest and fastest tv upgrade we've done for intel extremetech upgrade the only hard part is the cable management yeah are you having some cables ever look how well i've cable manage them i have to undo that first i'm going to go unpack light bulbs apparently the coolest stick with these boys from philips is that you don't actually need their hub you can just connect to them via bluetooth how exactly that works i truthfully do not know because i would still think you'd need a hub if you want to control them and you're not like within a couple of feet of them i'm a bit of a short boy i don't know if i'm going to be able to do this nope violating company policy right now you're not allowed to make me feel short you know we said we weren't going to make a mess for a change and i consider this a success it's really not that bad right brandon i mean you can totally get at the sink in the kitchen yeah look at that water it's good for your ltt store water bottle right there yeah go buy a water bottle seriously i got to pay for the lab oh did we finally get it working yep okay choose your subscriptions uh definitely got that crazy tv no no you don't have fubo tv right now okay whatever that is acoustic auto calibration oh okay well we should probably sit where you would sit then i just realized something i can't believe i didn't call you on this earlier you have your tv mounted above a fireplace oh i thought i was gonna go the whole video without you noticing it it's a pretty low fireplace yes it's not like it's a whole wall type of thing like how marx is but but when i sat down and actually tried to watch tv i was like you're looking at the switch uh you were just benedict arnolded here i've just been informed there's something else stolen from the office in this room that i haven't found yet no he'll find it orange orange you say yeah orange well it's not that one wheel we don't have any one wheels there's a short circuit it's the one wheel what that was stolen those are expensive it's on loan it's on loan yeah what does that even mean it means no one wanted to try it out no one wanted to try it and no one asked me if i wanted to try it man i gotta say leave it to the procurement team to procure one heck of an upgrade living room tv looks so much better you've got the wicked gaming pc that's gonna be perfect for 1440p gaming you've now got a 65-inch tv in the bedroom and the gaming pc and the living room tv managed to not end up sounding worse you can't say the same for the turntable but hey you win some you lose some right i personally still think that the turntable sounds great i think it's a win i personally think it's a win if you guys enjoyed this intel xtreme tech upgrade check out intel there down in the video description obviously you guys know what they make cpus now gpus man wireless chip sets what doesn't until make kind of crazy and if you're looking for another video to watch maybe check out brandon's intel extremetech upgrade he shot for us today but he was on the other side of the camera for that and it was it was a gong show i blame matt
