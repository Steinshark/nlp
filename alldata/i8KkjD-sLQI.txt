if you're willing to accept as pretty much anybody in the field of philosophy of mine does that there are levels of consciousness below human consciousness then it's just an assertion without evidence that there can't be anything above yeah no you're right it's also because you know this Agency on yourself like it's like you can notice that there are things acting on you and that are constraining you and that are directing your your movements and your attention so it's like well why wouldn't that why wouldn't I use the same structure I've been using all the way down to now explain what's above let's say I don't know this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so hello everybody I am very excited and happy to be back with Father Stephen DeYoung we've been trying to get to talking for a while but it was always being put back but I'm excited that it finally happened and most of you watching this know father Stephen he is a priest in the Orthodox Church he's also the host of The Lord of spirits which is a podcast most of you that are watching this will also know about he's also written several books which I have here great books religion of the Apostles which uh which I was able to read before and and give my my opinion on he he published God is a man of war which I'm reading right now and the whole Council of God and introduction to your Bible and so you've been extremely prolific father it's crazy I know I think it's because you don't sleep that's what I that's the Legends we hear Yeah well yeah I don't sleep much it is true that part of it is that I don't sleep much but I do sleep some and so how how have you what did you think about the success of the Lord of Spirits because it's been a wild ride I the the fans of Lord of spirits are really into it and and it's it's wonderful to see yeah yeah it's um I mean Father Andrew and I were aware that there would be an audience for it um I think at first when we talked to ancient Faith radio they were not as sure as we were that there was an audience for it they thought it was going to be kind of a little niche thing maybe um but there's a much bigger there's been a much bigger audience for it uh than I initially thought and we've had people from all different Christian traditions non-christians listening to it uh some people who I I never suspected would be endorsing and promoting a podcast of mine endorsing and promoting it in various places um so yeah it's it's been pretty big but I think um even though it's different than a lot of things on Ancient Faith radio and different than just a lot of in general sort of religious podcasts I think it's addressing things the people have been at least aware of it's sort of the the fringes right of their ideas right and it's sort of taking those those ideas seriously and sort of connecting them in a way that I think is I think that's what's attracting people I I don't think it's adults at tones of my voice or I'm sure it's some of that and also your culture your cultural references yes I think it's a there's a Zeitgeist there's a moment I think also there's a strange some of it I don't think anybody controls would feels like the materialism that was ruling just maybe 12 years ago or maybe 15 years ago they're really harsh kind of new atheist material has been broken and and now people are scrambling to figure out and it's as if there's a space in their mind now to understand ideas that would have seemed completely ridiculous to them such as the idea of agency above humans the notion of these patterns and the fact that these patterns are have a kind of agency uh on on phenomena like all of these types of of thinking is something that for most people I know because I can see it people are surprised at themselves and they're like I I never thought I would be able to under believe this but it's also because they did understand it um and so I don't know if you noticed that as well yeah I mean I have and and it was kind of inevitable because that hard materialist View has a real contradiction at its core that eventually was going to break it because for example the new atheist would be all about materialism but then when they gave an account of history and particularly the history of religion they have religion with agency right religion caused people to do this religion caused people to do all these atrocious things religion cause it's like well wait a minute hold on right religious ideas right it's not a thing that exists right and so if there is this agent called religion in history right I mean you could call that God right like that it's it's not just humans it's it's causing humans to do things and so that basic contradiction meant you had to you had to accept the antithesis of their presupposition in order to accept their presupposition yeah yeah well there's so many blind spots in the new atheist thinking you know just in terms in terms of the way in which they get to their value system or the way they they pretend like they don't have hierarchies but then as soon as soon as they blink they're back into into these these hierarchies their own hierarchies it's it it's actually astounding to watch and it's difficult for people that are still in that mode to point it out because it's a blind spot they can't see it as you you point to it but it's as if they they don't know what you're pointing at yeah yeah and it's you really have to push like that contradiction I pointed out you have to push on their own terms a lot of times we've opposed people with those ideas by just loudly applying the other idea right or arguing for the other idea as opposed to showing okay let's take your idea seriously what you're telling me and follow through on it and does that actually work right like where where does that end up is it end up someplace self-contradictory right and and then it sort of you know say Boniface chopping down the tree right it's like you may not believe my religion but yours clearly has just Fallen apart right alternative right yeah definitely there's also there's also something else um there's something else interesting because as people are studying now the question of Consciousness and of agency and all of these issues are becoming coming to the fore in terms of of trying to figure out you know how what's the relationship between science and and human perception all of these questions uh people end up in a strange position as well where all of a sudden now it's the materialist or the naturalist that is reducing agency and conscious and self-consciousness at least to humans and so humans become this extremely particular thing in the entire universe that they can perceive this like wonderfully completely anomalous thing and also happened to be the strange anomalous thing out of which all meaning is is see coalescing towards and so it's almost it's it's without knowing it it's very religious although it's a humanistic religion uh whereas the way we we try to posit it is to say no these there's a scale and there are consciousnesses and and agencies that exist at different levels that seems that even in naturalist even in the naturalistic point of view it seems more reasonable that that would be the case yeah they're having to revert to a much earlier version of the philosophy of mind right they're having to go back to like Hegel saying that animals are basically just Little Machines right yeah process inputs and like they don't have any kind of awareness they don't have any kind of you know um and philosophy of mind has gotten way past that I mean I I reference Nagel's paper all the time on Lord of spirits what is it like to be a bat right but we just kind of say for it's like something to be a bat right yeah and that means there's some kind of Consciousness there right and if you're willing to accept as pretty much anybody in the field of philosophy of mine does that there are levels of consciousness below human consciousness then it's just an assertion without evidence that there can't be anything above yeah no you're right it's and also because you know this Agency on yourself like it's like you can notice that there are things acting on you that are constraining you and that are directing your your movement and your attention attention so it's like well why wouldn't that why wouldn't I use the same structure I've been using all the way down to now explain what's above let's say I don't know right right and and um yeah part of it I think is a Devotion to a particular understanding of freedom and free will um that and and that's deeply tied into Western theological Notions of guilt and choice and accountability right and the whole Western view of sin as being purely transgression right and so if the more you say a person's choices are affected by things greater than them right forces sort of above them then that if you have those presuppositions means well that makes them less accountable for their actions right and and we're not gonna be able to then ascribe guilt right the person for action and so those constructs are falling apart but you don't necessarily need those other constructs right um especially in a Christian context yeah right where in a Christian context where we're not about assessing who is a a good guy and who is a bad guy as much as that's in grade in our culture right and every Marvel movie is the good guy the bad guy right and the good guy wins yeah um right but we're about uh trying to help redeem people from those forces right Christianity has always taught this there are these forces abroad in the world they enslaved people right they get they people get locked into and controlled by these passions and we're trying to free them from that not hold them accountable for their actions right like in this guilt and Punishment sense yeah I wanna the the biggest reason why I had I had you here was because I wanted to talk a bit about the image of the son of man it's one that I've been bringing up more and more in my talks I've been I've been kind of alluding to it as a possible way to help people even secular people understand the relationship what man means or what what is it that The Heavenly Man could be so I know that you've studied that quite a bit in terms of also understanding it's how it leads into or it's a it's a kind of hint of trinitarian theology in the Old Testament so maybe you can you can kind of take us through the line of these these glimpses in the Old Testament and how they ultimately lead to the Incarnation yeah yeah so probably I'll have to couch this a little and people be familiar with this who Listen to Lord of spirits but if you haven't this is one of the most shocking things I say right which the idea of a god having multiple hypostasis is not original to the doctrine of the trinity this was commonly held by every culture in the ancient world [Music] right they they understood that and in fact for them the the number of hypostasis the number of embodiments or localizations or whatever term you want to use in English right of that God was potentially infinite yeah you could make one that's what idolatry is right you're making one right in this particular place for this God and you know the ancient Egyptians noticed that when they were worshiping Rey in his Temple at the idol the sun did not disappear from the sky right so they they understood that there were multiple sort of coexisting localizations of this one God right so uh the doctrine of the Trinity is a particular teaching regarding this that The God Who created the universe that God has three hypostasis right exists eternally in three hypostasis and always and only three you can't make more you can't right even though the Israelites tried with golden calves and other things right um so uh the doctor of Trinity is not this new thing never before heard of that just drops out of the sky right with with in the fourth Century right after a long period of development or anything else and so um you see this idea that the god of Israel has more than one hypostasis more than one person right in reflected in the Old Testament even though it's not sort of narrowed down completely in the mind of the writers of the Old Testament text or even the Jewish texts that come quote unquote in between the Testaments they're all sort of aware of this but how they work that all out is very different and so the son of man in in uh Daniel uh is one sort of critically important one and it's the one that becomes Central during that second temple period from about the the fifth century BC to the First Century A.D um when you read Jewish literature addressing it they're all coming back to Daniel they're all coming back to the son of man who who is this right because this is clearly the second hypostasis who is it where did he come from right what what's happening um so what Daniel does in that text is he kind of remixes part of the bail cycle so in the culmination of the bail cycle Bale is enthroned by his father l um and uh so the the depiction of the Ancient of Days in Daniel is very clearly drawn from the way L was traditionally depicted but the big remix happens with the son of man that it's not Baal it's not another God who is now exalted himself to the pantheon when Daniel says it's one like a son of man it's it means this is a human right this looks like a human to me right um but he comes riding on the clouds and the cloud rider was one of Bale's titles because he was okay and there are other parts of the Old Testament where that imagery gets picked up and attributed to Yahweh right so the the psalm we read in the Orthodox Church at vespers right at the beginning it talks about he makes the clouds his chariot he walks on the wings of the wind right that's picking up that bail in the tree and applying it to Yahweh later in that same Psalm it talks about uh Leviathan who he made to support in the waters yeah and that's again a kind of a riff because Bale defeated Leviathan that was like his big claim to fame as I fought and defeated this chaos Monster and that depicts Yahweh like playing with him like he's a pet like this is his puppy or something yeah he doesn't have to fight it it's like a little toy you know um so uh but here that imagery is all being applied to this human figure right and because of the remixing of Ellen Bale you have a father-son element right brought in yeah okay in the relationship of the two figures um and you see this already in the Jewish writers yes for the New Testament that they're that they have this father-son discussion let's say yes okay yeah and so for example in the latter portions of the Book of Enoch the son of man is explicitly identified as the Messiah who is going to come you have uh even when when this is condemned eventually right in Jewish circles we're getting Jewish circles in the middle of the second century before this uh it was referred to as the idea of there being two powers in heaven and the word Powers there is ecstasia that we often translate as Authority but the idea is that somebody who has ecstasia can operate independently okay they're not under anyone else's Authority right they're not they're not depending yeah they're not dependent like a soldier would be dependent on a general or something right right so the idea would be rather than there just be there's God and then the Angels obviously are under his authority right all the other creative beings are under his authority that there are two in heaven who operate with that kind of authority and then there was there were different ideas most of the major things we consider trinitarian heresies from the early church are really extensions of those Jewish hypotheses into Christianity so there are Jewish sources in there who say well this must be just like the highest ranking angel right and you find them using the same text that the Aryans use later right or Philo Philo is basically a semi-arian he believed that the the logos and wisdom uh were sort of produced by God out of his own Essence right so you find these things that show up in later Christianity within the Jewish speculation already beforehand but when it's eventually condemned um and the first records we have of this on the talmud even though it happened in the second century when Christians were expelled from the synagogue yeah also you think that so the idea is that when the Christians were expelled from the synagogue they also banned these types of teachings these yes yeah and there's a really good book by a Jewish scholar Alan Sagel called two powers in heaven that talks about this in the second century um and in the talmud there are two different answers this problem in different places so in one place it talks about they have this problem with Rabbi Akiva who lived at the beginning of the second century it was part of the barcode for Rebellion he becomes this huge figure in Judaism but it was sort of well known that he had believed in two powers in heaven okay so in one of the track states of the talmud they want to rehabilitate him they say well yeah he thought that at first he got corrected yeah okay right yeah the way it's phrased in the Talbot that he got correct is that he later said uh one is for mercy and one is for judgment now that sounds obscure what that means yeah but it's referring to the Thrones that are set up in Daniel yeah the two I mean you see those you see in Christian iconography you see those two angels the red and the Blue Angels yeah right the two the two Thrones are set up and so what is the extra days what is the son of man right and so they say well Akiva later said essentially a kind of modalism right that that God uh manifests himself as an old man to show Mercy that is a young man for rigor yeah yeah but they made they brought it down to like the the two hands or the the two sides I'd say right interesting wow and then the other explanation is is uh there's a story that recounts this Rabbi who uh through kind of merkava mysticism has this vision of heaven and while he's there he sees this Angel sitting down right and so since he sees the angel sitting down he says oh this angel must have authority and so he believes that the two powers in heaven and then he's like sending to Exile on the earth and condemned forever and the angel gets uh flogged apparently they're sitting down and it sat down on a throne it's like that's the thing people aren't used to they don't understand the imagery of what it means for someone to be sitting and someone to be standing we do in the Orthodox church we have a better sense of it because in theory we stand in the church not much anymore but yeah that at least was the the original idea yeah yeah or interesting stuff yeah so so even the tell if it offers these two different sort of resolutions to it right in terms of of who this figure was because the figure also appears in Ezekiel but in the in the merkaba itself like is it yeah Ezekiel sees one right as as a man right and so there's well there's there's this tension all the way through the Old Testament so in the same chapter in Exodus at the beginning of the chapter it talks about Moses speaking to God face to face it literally says mouth to mouth as a man speaks to his friend and then a few verses later in the same chapter Moses says oh I want to see your glory and God says no you can't see it and live you're like well wait a minute right they were they were talking just to go up there like what is happening right and and so there's there's there's attention to the Old Testament of no man could see God no one could see God and live and then there's all these stories of people seeing God yeah you know and Saint John takes that at the end of the prologue to his gospel says no one has seen God at any time that's not a retcon of the Old Testament like just forget all those stories they're now not canon but he said the second part of that is but either the unique God or the only begotten God who is at the side of the father has made him known so he's saying it was this Divine son it was this second figure who people were seeing all through the Old Testament and the father is the one who remained unseen but this was already in there right and this connection of him particularly to Humanity right in a way that uh the extra days was not right that the the father was not right exactly and so that in our that's in the Orthodox tradition we have a very particular preservation of that because it seems like although how can I say this the idea for example that the CR that the man Jesus Christ created the world for example you find that in some in some text you see that in Saint Maximus it has some crazy sayings you know when while he was on the cross he was creating the world like all these types of contradictions but for sure in the in the iconography it was preserved very attentively so until the 14th century you when you see God represented anywhere in in the Old Testament it's always Christ and so when you see the creation of man you see Christ and it's Jesus Christ right it's it's it's not a it's like it's not the pre-incarnate logos it's it's the man uh Christ who is creating the world and it seems like it's a it's a continuation of that image you know of the son of man the idea would be something like although in terms of time it doesn't make sense for us but that automatically doesn't matter the idea is that what they saw what Daniel saw was Jesus Christ at the side of God the Father yeah yeah and the the time problem is is because of the type of creatures we are right we were talking you know we mentioned Nago what is it like to be a bat right animals don't experience time the same way we do right there are all different ways in which their Consciousness is different I was recently watching a thing about a dog that had to have a leg amputated and animals adapt to that kind of thing almost instantly humans go through all kinds of right because we have a different kind of bodily awareness right than an animal has right so an animal's just I have three legs now okay right yeah there's no morning yeah um so that includes the experience of time and so uh we want to apply our experience of time to for example Angelic beings so this comes up a lot with Lord of spirits stuff because it's well when did the Angels Fall yeah right it's sort of like well what time is it in heaven right now like what time zone are they on right um we're projecting right our experience onto beings that are not like us whose Consciousness is different than us I do experience time in a different way and there's this huge break point as soon as you try to get to God yeah right now you know and so time and space are really attributes of created things yeah right and we've been taught in in Western theology even right we talk about omnipresence you know well God's everywhere right it created Things Early in one place at one time but he's in all the places all the time right that's not really what that means right you read father dumitrus Standalone is really good on this in his Orthodox dogmatics right he has talks about God's attributes being Supra essential so it's equally true to say God is everywhere and to say that he's nowhere yeah right and that basically what we mean is these spatial categories don't apply to God these uh temporal categories don't apply to God when we say he's Eternal yeah right and so when we talk about um Christ before yeah for the Incarnation the Incarnation that's presuming that Christ as God experiences time the way we do that there was this before and after and over and over again in our dogmatics in our hypnography and everything it talks about how Christ took out our human nature Christ we came in without change or alteration yeah and I don't think we take that seriously enough yeah we we have this idea that that because we say things like Christ ascended into heaven and his and and his body is there next to the father but we now we think that that's in time it's like well wait a minute like yeah yeah and that was you know sorry calvinist I gotta get one of these in here right that was that was the Calvinists it wasn't Calvin himself but that was the calvinist whole argument against Luther on the Eucharist was it can't be Christ's body because Christ's body is in heaven right yeah it's in that place so it can't be all these others yeah yeah what's going on what's going on yeah so there so there's an interesting idea which is something like when Christ ascended into heaven he ascended into heaven from the beginning like he ascended into heaven from forever like from Beyond time let's say like that there is no that he entered into that it that that that Christ's body is is in is in God right it's not it doesn't it doesn't it is not no longer it is not yeah it's not limited by time or space ultimately right it's not a question of time and change that we experience yeah there are points where these realities enter into the realm of human consciousness right yeah that's the best way to explain it there are points in in our history in our human history where the fall of certain Angelic beings entered into our conscious experience there's a place where Christ's Incarnation entered into our conscious experience but it's not that it wasn't true before that yeah right that's why he's the lamb slain before the foundation of the world yeah I've been quoting that verse a lot these days right I mean that's so that these things are eternally true but they enter into time and space right and our experience in a particular way yeah because of the type of beings that we are and so I want to I want to propose something to you and I want to know what you what you think about this because I've one of the reasons why I've been thinking about this question of the son of man is because we have this it's a technical problem almost it's a technical problem right now in terms of the transition into people understanding the notion of principalities or the notion of higher forms of agency is that there's a sense in which there's always a difficulty or an ambiguity where people will want to say well it's a projection of the human psyche let's say and you see that even in the Ancients you'll find texts where they'll say are the gods of creations of men you know or or vice versa like what's the relationship because the the gods are in the image of man you could say and also the things they manage like cities like the aspects of reality that they manage are related to us right so even in the Greek in the in the the Greek uh idea that of Poseidon like Poseidon is is the god of the seas but he's it's always related to how it affects troubles or helps us as humans um and so what I've been thinking about is it's there's a sense and you see that in in The Narrative of scripture which is something like although these angels are above us ultimately they are meant to serve us that ultimately to the extent in which we are in Christ who is the son of man who is the Divine man then we will rule over the angels and so it seemed to me that the notion of The Heavenly Man the son of man uh even if for people who don't necessarily would even come to believe that that's Jesus Christ let's say who just have this idea of a Heavenly Man or a man with a capital M would be a solution to the technical problem of agency above us is that it's nearered through human man Consciousness and so it the question of whether they're projections of the psyche or existing above us becomes mood in this notion of a Adam Cadman or you know Universal Man or Heavenly Man as we find in in these kind of traditions yeah yeah well and that's that's built into I mean Hebrew straight out says that right that the the Angelic Spirits were right created to to serve us to minister to us um but that's that's built into well this is something we've lost this is built into what's going on in Genesis 3 with the fall of the devil because what you find when you read the fathers closely if you get rid of Milton right we don't need any Puritans Milton's one of the better ones but we don't need him either that's um but uh the devil fell all the fathers have you know jealousy and envy right and it's not jealousy or Envy of God somehow it's jealousy or Envy of humanity yeah that's something that most people don't think but it's definitely it's there it's like it's weird because it's there in the Islamic tradition too like it's actually there's a story where where the devil's asked to Bow before Adam and then that's how he is cursed so it seems like it was probably coming out of these Christian Traditions at the time too and it it it makes less sense in Islam because they don't have Christ like you were just talking about yeah right because the destiny of man is not just like you know you're gonna stay a Corporal and man's gonna humans are gonna be getting made Sergeants right he's going to get promoted over you it's the destiny of Christ of being united to God in a way that the angels are not right as Hebrews again like reiterates right um and so that is that is built in there but even the language used by somebody like Plato when he talks about the gods being allotted their various places and and things that they're in charge of he describes them of shepherds that they were appointed to Shepherd the people and he says for a Time they did it as gentle Shepherds and then for him something changed for him there's this Golden Age the age of Cronus when that was true and then after that things changed right but he acknowledges that's not the way it is now with the gods right and you read Homer and you quickly see that's not yeah they're feuding and fighting with each other and switching sides in battles and you know um and so they've they've become they've become something different if you read eusebius's demonstration eusebius of caesarea this demonstration of the Gospel he sort of goes all in on this in terms of this being what the gospel is about it's about these Spirits rebellious spirits who are assigned to the Nations and she talks about how they were assigned to lead and he's picking up on Saint dionysius here too they were assigned to lead the Nations to God like right to lead them to Christ but they did not they LED them somewhere else and so now new Spirits like the Saints right are now replacing them who will lead right Humanity to God and to Salvation to becoming like God right and um to sort of accomplish that that Destiny so it's not just leap frogging in a hierarchy that's set up artificially yeah it's an ontological difference yeah and so man so man as this point you could say this anchor between the visible created world and the invisible has an advantage ultimately you know because all the the Pinnacle of that would be Christ you could say the Pinnacle of that connection would be Christ and and then that Center becomes has an advantage over the incorporable beings even because it it kind of spans all the hierarchy itself right so the the you read the celestial hierarchies of Saint dionysius right and the these aren't like races of or species of angels right that look certain ways because they don't reproduce right that's not the idea is they have different jobs they have different tasks right that they're performing in these different ranks and uh the higher the rank as it's described the closer they are to the throne of God and so the more they participate in the grace of God because God empowers them to fulfill sort of their job assignment their role that he created them to play right but Angels don't get like promoted up that ladder it's not like well you did a really good job as an angel we're going to try you out as an archangel see how you do right like you know maybe you'll be a throne someday right like that's not how it right how it works they have this job whereas Humanity because in Christ our shared human nature is perfectly United to God right in Christ the person of Christ because of that Humanity can make infinite progress in the grace of God toward God there's a potentially infinite because the distance is infinite between God and any creature we can make infinite progress toward God which is something the Angelic Powers can't do and that invoke jealousy in some of them and add rebellion in some of them and so what's interesting what's interesting uh to me especially like this this it's a this Doctrine or this notion is that in some ways it makes sense of creation I've always thought that that the notion of the OSIS ex helps us understand the reason for creation because I remember when I was younger I was told something like you know God created us for us to submit to him and and glorify like that's our job like we're there so God creates the world and the world is there to worship him basically there's something I mean there was something unsatisfying about that yeah like really God creates so God creates the world to worship him I I guess I mean I mean he is God so he he deserves it I'm saying that I want to take away from God but the notion that there's rather this it's almost like a love let's say a it's like it's almost like a love story you know where God creates the human person in order to then bring the human person back into him to the extent that that that's possible like that that that seems like a much more and that we do the same with creation we could say that it's also kind of our job to do that with creation it makes just makes it a far more beautiful story to me that that's it's God's love yeah he has no needs but out of love he created Humanity to share his life with to share his Divine Life with and this undergirds in the Old Testament all of the language of Israel as sort of his wife and then the language of the church is the bride of Christ because we have to go back to the social structures of the time right which where a man would become established right he would create a life for himself right he would have a life he would have property he'd have right a place and then he would marry a woman and bring her into that and then they would have children right and those children would share they would share that life together right and so he's using that cultural imagery to explain right God has created this world right he has this life in himself and he creates humans and brings them in to share it with them and so it's not God demands worship if you refuse he's going to be very angry at you and torment you eternally for it right it's God created you out of love he's extending that love to you he wants to share his life with you but he also leaves you free right there's a right of consent he leaves you free to reject that if you want to and cut yourself off from it if you want to right which is a very different picture and so where do you because this has been I guess like there's a there's there's you guys talking about this in terms of the the this different vision of well I guess it's a it's also in some ways a restoration after the materialism we've been through this vision of divine Council you know this idea of these hierarchies of intelligences all of this a lot of people are going back to that people always quote Michael Heiser but even even people that are kind of in completely on other tangents I've noticed that that David Bentley heart has been going at that too you know saying saying basically Paul is talking about angels like he's called all Paul's talking about his angels all the time and people seem to have forgotten that uh so so it seems like this is to give me your impression of this because it seems like there is we were talking about this idea of re-enchantment there's this there's this moment of re-enchantment but it seems to me that there's a that the re-enchantment isn't always good let's say that although this moment in in the breakdown of materialism is offering us the possibility of of seeing these Mysteries once again it's also a space of flooding in of of all these demons basically that the demons are flooding in too so I don't know if that's something that you've noticed or that you've thought about in terms of the the current moment well I I I don't think they ever actually went away I don't think closing our eyes and pretending they weren't there you know you look at the history of mass murder and genocide in the 20th century all over the world they were there and I don't think pretending there weren't any Spirits really protected us rather than if anything the opposite right there were Spirits at work in different places at different times moving people in masses of people right um so in one way I think just being aware is better than being in denial right of the reality the the problem is I think so we've lost sort of a spiritual technology you might say a spiritual technique know-how that we used to have right that because we understood these things so we understood when we sensed that there was this malign Spirit at work in a group in a place right in a nation or something we sort of knew how to exercise it and how to invite in another better one right and you see this as the as the Roman Empire was christianized right they acted this out very literally you know Saint Cyril of Alexandria taking the bodies of Martyrs and having them reburied where Pagan temples used to be um this was very much very much acted out and I think we've we've lost that know-how is our biggest problem even as we're becoming aware right we may become aware like there's something wrong here there's something you know there's a spirit moving this is right but we don't know how to make that switch and that's even true I mean just to take a particular case that we mentioned recently our lord of spirits with technology yeah right with with technology this has been true throughout history every time we first discover something our first use for it is pretty much evil right so we learned how to split the atom make a bow right and and the second atomic bomb that gets dropped wipes out more than 50 percent of the Christians in Japan in Nagasaki it was the most Christian City in Japan before more than half of the Christian population of Japan was there wiped out right by a bomb um the internet I don't remember how old you are but I was there back in the old days when it first started and it was mostly pornography right away yeah right that's the pornography distribution system um and now social media right like and all of these things our first use for them is evil but we used to know down the road how to make the move right how to banish the spirit that was you know that maybe helped us find the technology before we were ready for it and how to then put it to a better use and now I don't think we know how to do that anymore um yeah because that narrative is there this is something I've been reflecting on quite a bit it's there very much in scripture you have a sense in which even in the Bible you know even without looking at the extra biblical Traditions you have a sense in which technology comes in with the fall of Cain and Kane's descendants are the ones the ones that develop technology and that brings us down to the flood but then you have a sense in which the ark is also a technology and that it covers you could say Keynes technology right it becomes it raises it up and becomes a vehicle for preservation through the through the flood and then you see the same with the question of the temple and the Tabernacle and the temple like you know it it's um I think it's bezalel when the when he's named as one of the ones who who uh creates the Tabernacle it's his name he sounds like the darkness of God and then he's called an artificer which is the only other place in the Bible where that word is used except for tubal cane so it's like they're clearly linking him to tubal Kane but basically saying like we're going to redeem this process you know uh and if you add the enokian Traditions into that then it becomes even clear that there's a a sense in which this taking of that's like reaching up and grabbing a pattern of reality and then pulling it down into the world you can see that as having sex with a having sex with this with the demon like you but different ways to image that right but it's like you take from above and you bring it into yourself and then usually the the result of that is a giant it's a it's like a it's it's a giant body that is very powerful that destroys uh and and it's like this and it's say it's as if people have forgotten that and now it's so out of control you think that technological progress is a good in itself which is just the craziest thing in the world to think that but that's well I mean you look at American politics right you have we have two parties one of which is just completely technocratic neoliberalism technology will solve all our problems and the other one is technology drives the free market and so it's good for Commerce so it's good right so there's no there's no sort of dissent on the technological innovation will will always be good we'll always move in a positive direction yeah but even though now there's this awareness more awareness coming awareness without the tools to do something about it just causes everybody to get black pills right realize how horrible everything is just you just lay down and and sleep that's um you know and I mean really so if I mean if you're in a form of Christianity that doesn't have any relics you can't go bury them in the Pagan Temple yeah right if you don't have any holy water you can't come and and bless your house right if you don't have right and so even our Christian practice and this isn't just a pitch for the Orthodox church right because there are other churches who do have some of these things and there are a lot of people at the Orthodox Church especially in North America who are practicing in a very materialistic way shall we say um but we've lost a lot of those tools or at least we think or we think you know the priest's coming to bless the house is just like a nice thing he does when he comes and visits once a year yeah they don't see it as as a as a the manifestation of authority over over something like a pattern that's there it's like installing a new pattern of authority which comes from God and is and is brought into the into the the place that's and and it makes like it's I always try to translate this stuff for secularists so they can kind of understand why sprinkling holy water would change something and it has specifically to do with the idea that if you have a pattern that is out of control and it has a life of its own then you need Authority in order to change it you can't just change it it you can't there's no way to just change things without something else taking its place or Another Story Another Vision another another pattern coming in and taking its place and that's that's that that means ritual it means it means Authority it means actual action right it's not something that just happens in your mind it has to be played out in the body as well of the place so it's not this isn't like just mumbo jumbo because I know that a lot of people will listen and think well this is just mumbo jumbo like why would sprinkling water on something make it make change it and because because of because patterns change with authority that's how it works right well and part of this is um uh confession I watched part of you talking to Douglas Murray and got super frustrated about this and stop um the guy is too Protestant to be a Christian um he's the the the idea that we have that's what Been bequeathed To Us by particularly Puritan protestantism that that what's important is ideas and that ideas precede practice has broken all of this for us yeah we have this idea well you have these theological ideas what makes you a Christian is that you accept that they're true so if I gave you a true false test you'd put the t's and F's in the right places right now you're a Christian because you believe that these certain things are true yeah and then you come up with practices to reflect your beliefs right and that's exactly backwards right that but ideas and beliefs emerge from practice emerge from a way of life right and a way of being in the world right and so I mean if you took a time machine back to ancient Athens and said to them so you believe there's 12 people up on this mountain like we could go there right now right you wouldn't find them and they govern all of human Destiny and they right you actually believe that that's they look at you like you were crazy yeah that's right right because that's not what it meant to be at a theater it was to hold certain beliefs right what it meant to be an Athenian was to have a connection to that piece of ground that your family had worked for Generations outside Athens right and that Athens was the center of your social and political life right and part of that was the worship of these particular Gods at the United faced us right and all of this but all of that emerged and so they would if they were able to answer you they would say well no you need to move here and you need to come and share our life right and you need to live the way we live participate in our festivals participate yeah and then then one day you'll be able to see the gods you'll understand yeah you'll understand what all this is about yeah right you'll understand what all this is about and this is this is a problem with the way a lot of Orthodox churches do catechesis because the way we do catechesis is well here's the dates of the ecumenical councils and here's the Orthodox Church believes this and this and this and we try to convince people outside the Orthodox church or outside of Christianity to believe that this is true right whereas what we need to be doing is and what I try to do at least is even if a guy shows up and he's like I've read this giant stack of books on the Orthodox faith and I've watched every symbolic World video and I'm on board I agree 100 with everything right I'm still gonna make him attend the church for a year yeah I become part of the community and start fasting and feasting with us and getting to know everyone and all that because even those things that he says he accepts now will he will relate to in a different way at the end of that year right and so that that way of life right the idea that ideas emerge from that and they make sense in that context we do this with the moral teaching of the church all the time too you try to throw the moral teaching of the Church of people who are completely outside the church we're in a context where it doesn't make sense well why can't I do that right and it's like well there's a thousand things that would make sense to you if you were relating to the world in a different way yeah right and so yeah from outside throwing bee throwing a bunch of water around your house trying not to ruin any Electronics right does it look like this would be beneficial to you in any way right but it becomes meaningful within a context of relationships right and a way of living and being in the world right that that person doesn't share yet and so it's not going to make total sense to them yet yeah that makes a lot of sense well father thanks thanks for your time this was a great discussion and uh as if there are still people watching this that don't listen to the Lord of spirits you have to check it out and also don't forget father Stephen also has are you still writing your your your uh your uh Council uh hold Council of God blog as well are you still there there hasn't there hasn't been anything recently I've been focusing on books yeah but there will be sporadic things but it's still there
