one of the things that we found really interesting just the difference between the scan and the actual print from the scan for something as technically sophisticated as the engine they don't match up and we expected that people who wanted to look at the air engine would get really upset because you know the valves were a little bit out of place or this pipe or that pipe actually wasn't complete but we found that the scan itself was such high fidelity that when you put it over even a not quite accurate or quite inaccurate model people were completely fooled they believed their eyes over their fingers their eyes tricked them into thinking that this was really accurate and they were just blown away completely blown away so it's mounted on something that actually looks like it makes sense in a museum context it's one of these little you know acrylic boxes that you would hold something precious in that's actually holding the tracker so that the line of sight isn't occluded so that it can track properly and then mounted on top of that nice and firmly is the actual object and because the object is fully available to your hands from any angle you could pick it up turn it upside down look at it however you like the pilot project was done in collaboration with the darby museum and it was hosted at the darby museum and art gallery which is in the center of darby darby has this incredible history of manufacturing so for example rolls-royce is quite nearby and this in particular is a scan that they made of their aero engine which we then used in the vr experience and the aero engine was basically one of the two engines that powered the first transatlantic flight we also chose some other objects again with the guiding principle of of size and fragility so we have a painted object that if too many people touched it the paint would come off so nobody can ever touch it we have something made of glass and one thing that we were really excited about is we had something that looks not terribly exciting but it was a mystery object because they found it in their stores and they guessed that it had something to do with the region's long tradition of making silk and lace and fabrics but they weren't quite sure what it was and out of our first pilot with just two dozen people one of the people recognized it i think her grandmother had worked in the factory or something she said oh i know what that is i've seen one of those when i was a little girl and she was actually able to tell the museum what their object was and one of the elements that we were very interested in as well is looking at storytelling if you sit down at the pub with a friend and have a chat that's conversational storytelling you're telling stories back and forth to each other and then you can imagine someone who gets paid vast amounts of money to go to a big hall and tell a proper story that you've paid lots of money to go and see that's storytelling and so what are the various factors that nudge you towards one or the other and so what we wanted to do here is to make people feel comfortable enough that they would open up in front of a camera in a public place in front of people they don't know but also get them to feel a little bit under pressure so that they didn't lapse into just chatting so that they thought about something that might be worthwhile for other people to listen to so we built a vr environment so that people could engage with the museum objects and engage with them using passive haptics so that they could reach out and touch them and get really engaged within that way or at least we hoped they would get engaged that way and it turns out that they did it reminds me a lot of childhood messing around with model kits and having those as sort of something i used to spend a lot of time doing and then because they were so engaged with this and they were able to experience it in their own way in their own time and we carefully nudged them and asked them oh does this make you think of anything does it remind you of anything what about it excites you um then they were prepared to tell a story and we wanted to make sure that they felt comfortable enough that they could think of something to say and not get stage fright but we wanted them to say a complete thing that could be sort of a unit a story of video that people would watch and that the museums could use and show to other people and put on their social media anything that they wanted to use it for which of course the people would give access to the museums for that the museums didn't just take it this was all very explicit in the vr environment to help with that we set up a set of lights and a camera and when they were ready the floodlights came on and the camera came on so they really knew like this is the moment i'm telling a story and i need to make sense while these lights are on and then they were done and the cam the lights and the cameras shut off and um nothing had actually happened because this is all in vr we would come in later and cut the story where it needed to be cut but to them it felt like they were in this museum space full of museum objects and someone with a camera and lights was capturing their story and so they felt like they had really invested something of themselves and built more of a relationship with the museum and and given something to the museum of their own personal connection to the objects so this now verbally can be brought into vr you can use uh newer optical tracking technologies but looking pretty similar to the output that you would want for the word dog so it's going to have to put those two words close together if it wants to do well at this task
