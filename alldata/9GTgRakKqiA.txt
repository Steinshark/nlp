all right this is called hot takes remote work one don't let anyone Gaslight you to believe otherwise uh so typically when I read this type of language I'm just before we even get started on this typically when I read this type of language I feel like the person is going to be really aggressive and say a bunch of stupid things okay I'm just saying and second off yes I do have blue hair okay I have blue hair because I lost a bet with chat okay so stop ask me about my blue hair okay I I lost I'm a loser and now I have blue hair so deal with it classic Boomer take classic oh as absolutely all right let's find it bad managers and CR bag holders lost competent employees and internet Savvy teams W arbitrary author authoritarian control over your work life is so 1900s yeah I think we're going to have a very interesting article here to discuss about this um but real talk so we're just I'm going to make an an immediate judgment call right off the rip um if anyone doesn't understand the value of in office work I think you're you're just entirely too onedimensional and if people don't understand the uh the benefit of remote work you're entirely too one-dimensional right I think I think that you are weak and you make shitty thoughts about your life there's always benefits to both and anyone that says there's ones appear negative while ones appear positive it's just like that's just stupid you're just not even thinking you're not using your you're you're not even using your faculties of reason to like think through a problem uh in office is fundamentally for juniors you got to explain that we're bring bringing it up let's bring it up bring bring get get up on the big board get on the big board anac anacardo Reds let's he anacardo Reds let's come on Bring it on Bring it on anacardo reds why why is it fundamentally for juniors by the way does any would anybody does anybody want to take the bet that the word colonialism is mentioned in this article come on oh in office is fundamental for juniors yeah you know that ly okay so sometimes people say that I have reading problems and I completely completely agree with that statement now that I've read it I now believe everything he just said and I'm the stupid one okay uh not just fundamental uh fundamentally just fundamental it's important for juniors to be in office yep I you know y yep yep that's fair fair fair take Fair take all right so uh let's go on this I previously wrote that what is still going on to be my final post on remote work at least the work part in it I went through the reasons why competent teams will be distributed for bits of work it's such a bold statement today and into the future for Adam's o for atom's work we still need a human's presence for now Sky's definitely a AI maximalist in here as well I have nothing really to add to that part of the conversation remote work isn't even new people have been doing it since the '90s yeah yeah that's fair but in the time since I wrote the above post remote work won and became a normal part of life for a large Cort of the population this will only continue to grow and so I wanted to comment a bit more on the topic as some are still strangely in denial I actually think it's going to shrink this guy's a level 37 douch Noz is that a uh is that a World of Warcraft class um I think it's going to shrink because I think I think the reality is is that a lot of people start doing remote work because it it is there's a lot of benefits to remote work and you really like it I think during Co during all that time you started doing it and it's fantastic but then you start realizing some of the downsides and I don't think everyone's made for remote work and I think what people are going to realize is that a quite a few people aren't aren't quite made that way and they're going to really go huh this ain't for me and so I I do think hybrid hybrid makes perfect sense hey I'm going to work from home one or two days a week to me that seems like that seems like such a fair and balanced way to do something uh but it still requires you to live near your job you know what I mean so that's like for me that's like out of it I've been remote work now for almost four years and I can tell you right away that I don't love remote work when I go to the office it is there is a lot of cool things that happen at the office that I just can't replicate remote right uh I know for sure I'm not made for 100% remote work yeah it's just I can't replicate it uh depends on the company I don't think it depends on the company I just think there's things that you cannot replicate front end Masters uh that's how we work we work in office two to three days a week I think that that is I think that is a perfect I I think that that's a perfect approach I think that that really helps people that don't want to go to work that day like there's just times where it's just better to be like hey I'm heads down today remote work really accents the heads down and I feel like in office really helps make better kind of collaborative stuff and I know you can collaborate without I understand there's tools there's things that work out and people uh you know and people can I I mean I love the idea of making it optional for sure how do your kids affect your proon on office work that's a good question how do kids affect it I mean I I spend much less time driving which I think it's just a net benefit in in many many areas my own personal sanity uh and I get get to spend more time with the kiddos you know what I mean I get to kind of trade that travel time for something else it's a lot of time that is just wasted driving and so again I'm totally on that team question Prim how many uh viewers would you have during the day if we were not all remote probably a lot less okay a lot of the viewers right now press one if you're remote press one if you're remote right now it's kind of a wall of ones here yeah we kind of got we kind of got a wall of ones going on here I feel like a lot of people might be ones all right let's keep let keep going let's let let's let Tim Cook let's start with this chart a friend shared with me on remote work quietly reaching equilibrium which happened last year I don't think it's really reaching equilibrium nothing about this says that it's reaching equilibrium drawing a straight line first off drawing a straight line here is not even a good straight line okay uh I'm not sure what the straight Line's supposed to even mean okay I'm not even sure what I'm not sure what it's supposed to mean uh New York offices use at 46% of the capacity dang that's that's tough that's tough for people who own stuff the lime green lime green science this is some lime lime green ass science going on here there's plenty of other data that samples that uh and Trends sources oh my goodness there is plenty other data samples and Trend sources here you can Google but broadly it is all pretty steady over over one4 of employees in the US are working remote in a durable fashion since 2020 and probably more interesting 68% would prefer to be fully remote uh again never believe statistics you know I know people do this thing where they talk about hey you know we have a sample size of four five 600 and uh you know we have a we have a confidence interval of whatever you know those kind of things they just don't there's the air rate can be significantly larger uh it is so much  to do those things I know people love it and they really cite it that it's really accurate Mandu statistics change when you change from four five 600 800 people to uh like 10 million like it it it genuinely changes a lot of things and we had to change a lot of like how we did a lot of AB testing at Netflix we had to really increase the amount of people just because like getting false positives really just happened or false negatives they just really happened I'm not a statition but it took a couple years of statistics and I think everyone should do that because you start to understand the flaws in these studies uh in the details yeah yeah anyways um share of Americans working remotely oh interesting yeah I mean it's not surprising that it was super high here and then it's doing this I'm curious if this is going to stay this way right I'm curious if it's going to stay if it's going to stay this way like how long is it going to be going oh yeah he linked this okay okay okay okay okay okay okay uh where do we go where' we go where' we go where' we go where we go where we go where we go where are you there you go there you are hey he linked the study with check instead of saying some random  all right let's see for 2023 okay so 68% let's see okay uh is there anything about okay anything about the numbers benefit okay we don't care about benefit um I I do I do I'm a huge I'm always a huge fan the career expert giving us things about remote work here we go a huge fan about this work demographics any all right references we got some references uh yeah I mean this makes sense this one we got to go through some uh 2017 that I don't know how well that works out for us right now 2017 was a lot different situation uh than uh 20 right you can't really use any of those yeah that's during put okay upw nice nice any of these actually going to be something about Beyond remote work let's see proves any of these are about the uh upcoming one type of reasons productivity retention and cost savings why work from benefit okay remote work struggles with most office blah blah blah combating social isolation remote work yep I don't I don't I mean I I'm not seeing anything that's going to none of those sources look like they address that specific issue I guess I'd have to comb through every single source to find it eventually uh but again if you just I mean the inverse would be why would you believe that without checking the sources yourself so we're GNA give you a ban feel like it's a solid ban I feel like that's a solid move solid move get him out of here get him out of here get them out uh all right andless cubicle farms uh were never an end state of anything and all dude Savage absolutely and all this can be repurposed for better use shopping socialization Recreation uh residential and exciting novel Concepts we're not even considering yet I'm doubting I'm doubting hard uh you know like one of the one of the hard Parts is is that there's a lot of these places that are uh you know they're they're this this idea that they're 46% utilized or whatever they're like not utilized and then they're heavily utilized and then not utilized and then heavily utilized ized and it's not it's not clear another thing is like I just heard one there's a lot of poor statistics that happen whenever you do things in aggregation like that not every office is going to obviously work like that some are going to be zero percent and some are going to be huge percents working remotely means you don't need to spend seven figures to buy housing in the city yes exactly so I like that the future is here something let's see the future here is something to look forward to going to city centers purely to do something alone you can do anywhere makes no logical sense this was inevitable and good unless you wanted humans to remain enslaved and a great real estate and great real estate locations to be stuck in the 1950s Area Industrial economic use it's hard to call it enslaved you know when you're working at a Fang company where they feed you sushi rolls and such you know I'm just saying yeah the guy overcooked I'm just saying like enslaved is a little is a little intense on this one it's maybe to tone it down a little bit most places aren't a Fang yeah but a lot like when you go to the valley a lot of these startups are all pretty they're fairly Posh there's a lot of there's a lot of nice things that happen in a lot of them uh sushi rolls to keep you in the office longer exactly enslavement classic reminiscent of chatt slavery Sushi rules uh even the Old Guard uh suits at Goldman Sachs believe remote is here to stay I think it is here to stay for some percentage of work uh remote work appears likely to be the most persistent economic uh Legacy of the pandemic yeah about 20 to 25% of workers in the US work from home at least of the week okay well that's way different than remote work right this this ain't remote work this just that's just not remote work according to data Goldman uh sites that's below 7 47% uh during the peak but well above uh its prior average around 3% okay so that's incredible that it used to be 3% now it's 20 to 25% but that's still that's like that's not remote work hybrid ain't remote work that's true yeah it's like it's nothing like remote work hybrid is the best of both worlds if if you know sort of the whole living there I just don't want to live there right remote work allows you to live anywhere that's like the benefit uh the Battle Is Over said Diana Scott human capital Center leader at the conference board the conference board okay there are so many other issues CEOs are facing okay I I I like I'm not sorry uh Diana Scott this just this is not a convincing argument it's over CEOs have other issues like okay uh now that remote has been normalized for some time it was cool to also see some new research on public firms and distributed work just published December 2023 the full paper is worth reading but the summary is what you would expect if you're paying attention and viewing the is this issue objectively emphasis mine okay okay using a sample uh of standard and Po's 500 firms We examined DET uh determinants and consequences of us firms return to office RTO RTO mandates result uh of our determinant analysis are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to assert uh reassert control over employees and blame employees as scapegoats for bad performance our findings do not support uh augment let's see oh oh my goodness our findings do not support the argument that managers impose mandates because they believe RTO increases firm values further off or further are differences in differences test report significant declines in employee job satisfaction mandates but no significant changes in financial performance or firm values after RTO mandates yeah I mean there's a lot of really there's a lot of I mean there's so many confounding factors even in this statement so uh I mean look at Amazon Amazon said that they can't even they they're not capable of making the same money they were in Co so saying you can't really Co completely changed financial performance for a lot of companies years afterwards uh it was very very very difficult to say this um second RTO is interesting because you got to remember that you have a bunch of people who were remote OTE who are now being called back into office which by the way that sounds like it sucks and now they're forced to live something else so it would make sense that that satisfactions down this just makes sense but I think there's something that's kind of missing from this which is what happens one I mean the the hard part is a you can't AB test this right you can't have the same company ran uh two different ways but B you can't actually have something where it's just like right here's everybody that went remote remote well during those 3 four years when everyone went remote a bunch of employees were kind of identified and let go and a lot of things have happened and there's a lot of underperforming and all this but people who accelerated and did well with remote did really really well and now they're being forced back to an office so there's a whole bunch of people that are kind of optimized for a certain type of work now being put into a different situation which means it's probably going to be devaluing their work which means that when they there's another round of those people transitioning out and new people transitioning in they're kind of ready and it's pre-baked into the cake to work at the office which means that they're probably going to have an you know they're going to have their own proper performance line versus the people that really want to be remote they're going to have their own proper performance line and I don't know if you can say one is technically better for finances than the other I don't know it's an interesting question to ask but it's just stupid to kind of point this out like hey when they were forced back it didn't change anything it's like of course it didn't change anything you have a you have an you have an entire group that's optimized for remote work now being forced back in uh to be entirely honest though if you bet the farm on remote work forever being a thing buying a house in in the sticks without long-term Trend uh evidence uh from your own work I mean I did that Judo I did do that uh I did make the I did make the bet but I made the bet because I wanted like I was willing to make the yeah I I I was willing to make the uh the bet against it and if I couldn't continue to work at Netflix and remote then I was fine with it we had the move on right you weren't a three-year Junior at Spotify or whatever yeah I mean that's also tough yeah a lot of this a lot of these things in here as someone said ear earlier uh fundamental for junior work a lot of this in here isn't even discussing like tenure of an employee I think that really makes a huge difference tenure of of an employee when it comes to any of these things I cannot imagine being a brand new person to the workforce working remotely Juniors exist yet see I think that's part of the problem I think that's why we're having such a junior desert is because there's not nearly the same amount of in in office work I really do think that that strongly affects Junior higher ability like would you really want to hire someone brand new to coding where they live in Regina Saskatchewan it's kind of wild I think it'd be really hard out of sight out of mind I think it's really really hard yes I was I think it's a lot harder for everyone saying yes they're thinking of themselves I think if you were if you had to go hire 15 or 20 of these people all at once and you had all I mean you're going to decimate any form of progress and work for quite some some time uh we just hired a fresh from uh school kid and you can tell they are missing out on some things I try and stay in contact with them yeah I mean that makes sense there's a lot it's not just free I'm not hiring a junior remote that's a waste of money I do fully remote and travel all over the world it does not make things easy at times but the benefits of seeing the world win it out for me that makes sense uh but I will say that this is not for everyone uh you have to have good work ethic else you'll find yourself slipping and pushing off work oh absolutely uh and then you have to pay to fly all the all the remotes out once a year or multiple times a year I think my problem is that the office is too distant I waste four or more hours travel between home and my office oof that's an oof that's tough yeah see that's I mean I think that's where it's like it makes no sense to travel anyways absolute top companies like Nvidia worth well greater than a trillion are running remote operations for their team so there's really no excuse that this is just for smaller shops my team at Google was distributed many years before it was normalized and we worked on software at internet scale so in exec's comment here they're simply putting their lack of modern management skills on display for the world to see I tweeted jokingly about this several weekends ago um yeah but a huge P portion of Nvidia also works in office I mean I don't think that's fair and second off there's also this idea of like highly specialized teams can be distributed uh often you'll find that these really really really really specialized teams that happens like open connect at Netflix was distributed before Netflix even ever allowed remote work there was a zero remote work policy at at Netflix and open connect was the only team that I knew of that had that and the reason why they had that is they could not hire these super specialized people to work on these very specific machines unless if they were willing to hire them and they lived in say Sweden or wherever they were like they lived all over the world and so it's was like such a specialty type thing and they worked very very well and but it was like such a very Niche Niche item and so I'm sure Nvidia has a whole bunch of uh various parts that they can work oh I'm sure they got paid enormous amounts of money because they were so niched out that they couldn't even hire them they couldn't they could not hire them within the United States part of the time like it was it was very difficult um yeah I mean I think that this is a this is a very crazy take because a huge part of uh Nvidia definitely probably has in you know inhouse things I'm sure Nvidia I heard they're into hardware and it's just really hard to have a bunch of Hardware that you can just send distributively all over you know what I mean it's just like really hard to do that really the only other dinosaurs howling in the wind about the latest fax machine going extinct due to the internet are c b holders what is C bag holders what the hell is a c what's a cray create react app commercial real estate commercial real estate yeah I mean that's tough they are holding the bag for sure um who of course are upset uh by the way they don't really care who rents the place so I I don't I don't necessarily buy that this is real uh who are of course upset God forbid I like you should like it's funny that this article could be so upset about people not buy buying remote work but when someone else is upset they're like heaven forbid this sensitive man from being upset now where was I those  hate remote work just like oh okay okay guy okay guy uh have to reinvest or change strategies um it's really hard to change strategies uh you're parsing the article wrong I'm not sure if I'm parsing the article wrong here uh but this reinvest or change strategies is interesting because who would go who would go to a grocery store that's on the 36th floor of some building or 100th floor like who would go to there like really tall buildings don't really work well I'm just saying really tall buildings don't work well for commercial I think y'all wouldn't want to go they're upset at CH yes I know I understand it's who are upset if they God forbid had the reinvest or change their strategies God forbid having to re change your strategies and now they're upset about it that that that God forbid like it applies to this which is part of this right hey I would hate that you remote only folks God forb bed had to come back to office I think you'd I think you'd take it the exact same way like yo yeah how about screw you okay I like my remote work anyways but like you can't have a a it is you C like I mean there's reason why malls work in strip malls it's very very hard to have them work up and down because a elevators are just not meant for High Travel they're just not meant for high travel so if you had thousands of people trying to go up and down these elevators at all points of the day it would be like impossible they would stop on every single FL and if you had 50 these 50 60 it just it just it just it just does not work that way it's it's impractical take the effing stairs you bum yeah you go up those 36 floors on that on those stairs baby I'm just saying it's impossible right I don't know if you could do this I don't know if they could be repurposed and continue to clutch the pearls yep see he's definitely not assaulting anybody these are Pearl clutchers hoping the world would revert to a previous state they of course don't believe Earth can change something it's literally defined by we are a free capitalist Society hey at least we're not communism uh and so everyone has to go through the ringer of disruption but ultimately we come out the other side better for the vast majority is that true uh they'll evolve that's true remember when remember during covid when everyone had to go remote and uh everybody who was not a tech worker just lost their jobs remember remember that part which is like most of work remember when more than like when most people couldn't just work remotely and still to this day you can't just work like there's no such thing as a remote plumber I'm not sure that this is all that fair of a take they'll evolve yeah those plumbers will evolve but for some reason this group are extremely sore losers here I don't necessarily buy this article is definitely written from a Viewpoint of privilege this this article is definitely written from a Viewpoint of privilege in the sense that uh they've been able to work at Google on some high like Google did not do a lot of remote work and for them to be working on a distributed team that was distributed enough to be purely remote my guess is that they were a very specialized position and they probably made a lot of money doing really good and hard difficult work right uh this was uh uh there was this story last year in Minneapolis which was emblematic of so much I have seen in the soci local markets in which a cre create react app a commercial real estate commercial real estate owner says Hey Company please put a gun to your employees head because I want to make more money what they're saying where's Target they're happy to have their names on our sports stadiums but I feel like they don't have our cities back right now Jonathan Slaterman co-founder of real estate firm Rudolph Street realy company or Capital H gez where was Target in Minneapolis yeah it must have just been Co that caused Target to close up shop and leave I can't believe that I it's like there there there definitely was no other incidences that caused a lot of stores to leave Minneapolis crazy it's absolutely crazy there's just nothing yeah there's there's no other thing it's purely because these commercial real estate owners are just wanting money that's it not not a single other thing they just couldn't handle remote work and so therefore they closed up shop and left definitely definitely no other items definitely nothing else happened ever was it though was it uh the irony of this quote there's a lot of irony right now going on uh is Rudolph Street realy Capital and Jonathan himself self are based in Chicago not Minneapolis oh my goodness Checkmate atheist remote atheist uh they aren't even local part of the community they claim to care about they literally just care about their Holdings of course they also Flex aggregate asset value of greater than 600 million on their on their website ah they must be evil that's 600 million that's right where you become evil is once you get so much money there's a line um also I think that if this guy writing this article uh also had potentially his livelihood and things starting to crumble before his eyes he may write about things a little bit different I think any anytime any of us see what we're doing being slowly taken away over the course of the next few years like if you felt like you were going to lose all of your life savings and everything over the next course of the next couple years I think you would probably react worried I think you'd be a little bit uh you know concerned about such things uh cry me and overleveraged Realtors um you  your pants yeah absolutely uh real estate very complicated and anyone that anyone that just simply looks down on people that own real estate you're a fool I hate to tell you this but it's it's extremely complicated business it's very very hard to run right it's very hard to make money in real estate uh a lot most people end up ruining themselves in real estate because it is quite quite tricky uh it is very very tricky to do well real estate is how rich people get richer that see that's again that's that's one of those that's one of those statements people make that that just don't know anything um I hate to I hate to break it to you but that's just that's just inexperience yapping it's extremely overs simplistic I want you to go find that guy that owns like one or two properties and I want you to go ask him about how the rich are getting richer when he's working maybe about 100 to 120 hours a week you know when my dad died my mom bought a property on the bad side of town contract for deed where she couldn't miss a single payment she had to work 18 hours 16 to 18 hours every single day non-stop until as she said God gave her a vacation by slipping down the stairs and breaking her back six years of non-stop working she had 50 units on the bad side of town 50 units oh she's some sort of Big Rich ass person no we weren't we we got to the point where she could afford braces that was pretty sweet but every last thing was extremely extremely difficult uh you have absolutely no idea what the hell you're talking about real estate is not simple riches don't just flow out of anything okay it's not just faux free now if you think that it's just that way uh owning real estate is always a good investment tell that to the people that lost their lives in 2008 owning real estate is not always a good investment owning real estate and being able to pay for it over the life of its loan is a good investment yes you're absolutely right but if you rely on them for income it's not always you you just have to you just got to hold it longer this is the dumbest I will I'll tell the I I'll tell the bank that hey you don't worry about the payments I'll pay them just not right now don't worry Bank we'll come back to it financially when should someone get into real estate you should be willing to go if you go into real estate you should be willing to work for it like you have one of two choices either you have enough some other side of income that can pay for all the things that go wrong with it which often real estate don't even make like people that own a lot of these buildings don't make money in the first five years they're not making a lot of money it's extremely difficult uh if you get to that point if you get to that point then you you'll start making some money which is nice but we're talking about like hundreds of dollars we're not talking about Scrooge McDuck money you're not it's very difficult to make Scrooge McDuck money remember that's like 0.01% of people that's like you're probably not going to be that guy you're not that guy pal I'm not that guy daily commutes into an office are simply not coming back for competent people I am so I am trying not to be triggered by this article but that is an insane take by the way uh everyone I talk to who loves their craft would rather simply not work than go back to wasting uh their lives in traffic and this is how we designed America they would rather have time purely for working which they can do now the analogy is best understand this which I've said before is like believing in Santa Claus as a child and later discovering Santa isn't real you can't go back the spell of the office is being a a requisite uh for modern work was broken uh the genie is impossible to put back into the bottle everyone will adapt I thought the genie goes back into the bottle pretty easily I thought it's uh you can't put uh you can't close Pandora's Box you just got to make three wishes and boom Genie's back in the bottle everybody knows that just get that Genie back in the bottle uh just saying put that genie in the bottle you can't put the toothpaste back in the tube that of that have you ever taken two tubes of toothpaste and squeezed one toothpaste into another you can actually you can actually transfer toothpaste yeah it happened uh so all we have left are Bad Bosses really uh commercial real estate bag holders who want everyone to be miserable in order to prop their portfolios and some percentage of mid managers who simply hate their lives and want their peers to sit in traffic for 2 hours a day literally the cause of unhappiness in modernity that's that's a really bold statement that's a bold that's that's my friends that's a bold statement right there I mean I I also a wrong statement there's a lot of there's a lot of things wrong with that the world is pretty dark already but I can't imagine letting any of the these groups clawback an inevitable future the pandemic let us have early basically the only positive outcome for our suffering here if we didn't keep it we'd have made it through all of this for nothing there will be of I you know I have a I you know this is really intense language for working at Google you know I guess the lattes and the sushi just got to his head he just couldn't quite get it this is all this does injustice to people who actually have suffered this does this this does real Injustice to people who suffered strongly during all this this guy's cooking strongly like the lattes went to this man's head there will be of course U more nonsense layoffs in the name of RTO using it as an excuse which we know is a lie we have uh we and have research on linked above and property owners who have no idea how the knowledge economy functions believing they get to dictate how Corporate America Works Sayan people will continue to point out the absur absurdity and hypocrisy and for investors employees or even customers remember any company doing RTO is a giant red flag they don't know what they are doing uh are lying to the market or hate their own employees do you think there's any other possibility is there any other possibility I mean could there possibly be something else uh it's really just layoffs by another name because they simply can't be honest because they can't simply be honest all right in summary remote work one don't let anyone Gaslight you uh to believe otherwise I feel like you're kind of gaslighting us to believe that remote work one here you know you keep saying remote work one I mean I think a small portion of people will find remote work quite enjoyable another proportion of people will find uh hybrid nice and some portion of people will like in office there I mean people like in office work I know that sounds crazy and that's hard to understand but some people like in office work type one in the chat if you like in office work now remember this is this is a group remember this is a group of people there's a lot of ones flying across this there's a shocking number of ones flying across the screen uh you got to remember this is a this is a chat full of this is a chat full of programmers the least likely people in the universe to be pressing one right now right what do you prefer in office uh hybrid remote only unfortunately you can't do sen seniority either uh two weeks on two weeks off I mean I I wouldn't mind that I think that'd be I think that could be fun but I wouldn't do it in my position because I moved out of state uh I like in office work but I like remote more it has trade-offs but they're worth it yeah exactly this is just like Fork bomb Fork me Daddy all right so look at that for programmers I'm surprised that it's even this split right when I control the days yeah I mean that's hybrid right I'm surprised uh hybrid is that even that heavy uh the office space of our company is reduced quite a lot because of remote work even though I want more in office there's practically nobody there yeah that's real uh cooper. exe thank you anyways I think it's all interesting thoughts here I think I mean I think this guy clearly doesn't know I think I mean this is a hot take I wouldn't really call this a hot take as much as I'd just call this just like a mean take right I think one of the hu one of the biggest problems we have with this remote in office thing is that the other each side looks at the other person as being complete and so like these remote people are just like hey you know these are managers that hate you it's just like maybe they don't hate you you know there there there are alternative there's alternative realities that exist that don't have to be enslavement torturous clawbacks and people that hate you you know like there there people could maybe they don't want that to be honest I thought this was just the way people leave organizations without having management call it a layoff yeah the office is usually empty when I go there so not much benefit for me and when there are people I usually get distracted because people are asking me questions and interrupt my work yeah yeah but you got remember you also helped their work a ton in ways that just aren't really Poss possible you know like it's really hard otherwise you know so I don't know opinion Bros get mad about return to office I'm not like I don't love let's see not working in Netflix Henry your boss I'm not sure what that means there's some people there's always going to be good bosses there's always going to be Bad Bosses there's Bad Bosses at Netflix there's good bosses at Netflix there's no there's like this is not like there's not some some some strangle hold on uh some some cornering of good and bad going on right I think one of the biggest problems is people just hate their jobs underqualified middle management suck and dinosaur companies don't want to change so remote is an alternative of uh instead of fixing the underlying problem see the problem I have with this is that there's a whole new set of problems that are going to happen next we just don't have a lot of data on what are the next set of problems the thing is is that all the things you don't like about underqualified middle management and dinosaur companies they're going to be the same it's just slightly different facets of a new problem that will exist instead you're going to have I mean in my head what you'll instant almost instantly have is you're going to be having weird ways in which judgment will be passed about you because they don't even know you right they only know you by your internet Persona and you're going to get totally like there's going to be a whole bunch of different things that are going to be difficult you're going to have a whole new set like how are they going to pick management management is the best person at at writing up docs you're going to just have doc jockeys only as management like a whole new like there's a whole new set of realities that have to exist when things go remote that are going to also be difficult oh no I don't think I don't think it's as simple as just going it's better or it's worse uh getting uh getting canned by somebody uh misinterprets uh because somebody misinterprets a post yeah it can you can you very well can that thing uh get that thing away from me I do a lot of Google docking all right hey people I appreciate that the name hey is the primagen this was a weird article got me all hot and bothered
