ladies and gentlemen we are all fascinated by Ai and the good news for chess fans is that AI is constantly evolving and constantly playing against other AI in this video I'm going to show you four recent games that were played in the t-c superfinal 25 it's the 25th edition of the superfinal where stockfish emerged to play against Leela two of the strongest bots in the world went head-to-head against each other and the way they do this is they play certain openings up to a point with both white and black in pairs and then the rest of the game goes on I will be telling you about some of these games telling you when the opening stopped it's going to be wonderful one quick thing if you watch this video here in November 2023 I'm coming to London November 16th to 22nd we'll be doing an event at St pankas the train station uh and uh we will also be doing an event at Conway Hall which is a pretty you know like a mediumsized event venue we've got more things coming information about this is in the description if you live in London if you live in England if you live around there but you want to fly in or something like that I will be there I'll be signing books I'll be doing uh some meet and greets fan events Live guest the ELO so um yeah London Calling Gotham X London it's going to be a lot of fun and if you just got this video recommended to you uh outside of 2023 or you don't live in London that's okay maybe I will see you in your city one day and if you know if not then just check check the book out oh also signed copies of the book are available right now and only right now so if you want to sign copy you don't live anywhere near any of these events like London or New York link is in the description okay stockfish versus Leela uh two of the strongest bots in the world rated 3,673 which is about 3,400 points higher than you are and 3,642 uh Titanic 800 points higher than Magnus Carlson so basically if you combine Magnus and a beginner you get one of these so E4 E6 and actually in this very first game we have a Tash French defense this is the French defense this is the mainline this is the trash uh Knight D2 A6 and this is a very provocative system normally black is playing C5 but H6 A6 Bishop E7 they're all kind of ways to play against this flexible move order actually this game my friends leaves the opening book very quickly it leaves the opening book uh right here so Bishop D3 is the move chosen uh by white in this game and um now the players are basically on their own black plays C5 and Knight C6 and white plays Rook E1 and black castles so we have a relatively normal position after nine moves uh White has a space Advantage here and obviously a lot of pieces are pointed in this direction but that's never going to work because black is is obviously fighting for that square and black is going to try to expand over here so if you wait a little bit with white like let's say you play you know H3 uh black is probably going to play B5 and also black is kind of not afraid of playing F5 because if you don't take with white uh black will just steamroll you so black is just going to start attacking and you're never actually going to get an attack you just have a very symbolic space Advantage now here stockfish plays a very surprising move stockfish destabilizes its Pawn chain not only does it destabilize its Pawn chain it also welcomes Knight C5 and maybe even D4 and obviously if this were to happen this would be a very big trade and stockfish would need to deal with the ramifications of this position but actually Leela and both stockfish think that the best way for black to play is to first play Queen C7 and wait not to take the pawn on C5 first I can't really explain this to you but I think that obviously Leela wants the center pawn it does not want the pawn on C5 um so Queen E2 and white is now protecting this if this Pawn can survive it's going to be very difficult for black to actually make any moves now at this point uh Bishop C2 is a pure prophylactic move so Knight C5 doesn't actually hit the bishop uh and then black plays A4 which prevents white from expanding on this side white plays B3 to try to expand on that side take take and now black finally takes back on C5 takes takes okay so everything is good uh looks like the position is more or less equal white still has a very you know Pleasant tiny uh Advantage here because of probably just the fact that they have more control and this bishop still hasn't developed you know if a human is playing white here they might play Bishop F4 they might play Bishop E3 looking for a trade improving their position but then black will arrive and then if you try to fight back black will play Knight A5 and things like that and it's it's just not particularly Pleasant um so instead of all of that stockfish just decides to win right now stockfish at this point spots essentially like a 10 move sequence that wins the game which Leela probably also saw but drastically underestimated and that my friends is the fact that there is a Greek gift sacrifice possible here boom Bishop takes H7 now as you see from the eval this webbased stockfish is not impressed Bishop takes H7 Knight to G5 check and queen to H5 and normally that s symbolizes the end of the game CU Queen H is Unstoppable but what happens when the Rook moves now normally you play Queen F7 you can't do that now what normally you do here with white is you play Queen H7 queen h8 queen here and then you win but uh you can't actually do that because black is safe so white looks to be completely winning but is not winning at all and Bishop E3 yes stockfish realizes that it sacrificed a bishop for a pawn but there is no rush incredible stuff here the foresight of just I don't have to go anywhere I now pose a permanent nuisance to you look it's trading off pieces because it has time Rook to E3 black can play Knight takes E5 but then I sacrifice your queen has to guard this so if this I play Queen F7 and it's mate oh my God so Rook E3 Bishop B7 and white does not rush does not bring The Rook over white brings the other Rook you lose all of this there's D4 coming but you need to overprotect your Center for example if Rook takes A2 now Rook F3 is winning because black has to defend the pawn and can't because in comes the queen it's just the lingering presence of the attack it's like a headache that won't go away look at this look at this Rook G3 now Rook H3 now Black's King goes for a run and now stockfish Zips back to make sure that pawn is not going to be a problem now it plays H4 then it plays Rook F3 putting more pressure Knight d8 Knight H7 the king is being hunted the king is being cut off oh my goodness look at this the black king has no legal moves so now Rook to D4 resealing the defile Queen G5 the king is running takes takes in comes the queen my friends it looks like in this position black can just escape the checks but this is still losing and it's losing for a reason that stockfish saw all the way back when it played Bishop takes H7 half the half the game ago this is move 16 and on move 32 it becomes obvious it's not about Checkmate it's about the fact that after King C8 I would go here Rook E7 and I would push my Pawn that was the idea the whole time now my Pawn is three squares away from queening and there is nothing you can do queen C2 looks possible but then I will play Queen G5 simultaneously creating threats on the rook and Rook C1 this this computer doesn't even realize how powerful this is It's actually kind of insane if King C8 Knight F6 Rook E7 uh I think maybe you have to start with Queen G5 you start with Queen G5 just so you have threats on the rook and then you will just push this pawn and and it is it is insane that it saw that in the game instead we have Queen C2 but it's the same problem Knight F6 Queen G3 and uh there's constant threats there's threats down the C file there's threats on the King and there's threats with the H Pawn and my friends Leela has to lose its Queen and that's just not good enough not only look at this Knight D6 look at this apocalyptic conclusion to this game I win the queen and then I guarantee that I get the queen back but stockfish saw all of that it trades the queens and emerges in an end game up two puns oh my God and then it just starts pushing and this is likely a winning endgame of of knights and pawns and and the browser based stockfish doesn't even realize it it's because white has two passers that's why it's because these two pawns it doesn't matter that it's only one Pawn Advantage you push the king back far enough and now your king starts walking you defend your pawns and that's it this is not a defendable position you push you mate on B7 oh my goodness a French defense with a violent sacrifice that was not intended to deliver a mate at all I mean it was but it also wasn't what a highlevel game completely ridiculous stuff here by stockish look how long it waited and waited and waited and then finally it managed to utilize both the pressure on the king and the threat of the H Pawn to win ridiculous stuff just I mean these these engine games are are are just on another level This was um this was a queen Gambit declined it was Bishop G5 kind of a a traditional line and the players left Theory uh quite far in this game it was it was opposite side castling so stockfish decided it was not going to Castle King's side it decided that it was going to Castle uh well actually I guess theoretically didn't decide anything that was sort of decided earlier they wanted stockfish to Castle Queens side and start an attack and start a fight right so watch this long Castle now this is the first moment the engine is thinking on its own so instead of playing Pawn takes D4 it plays Knight takes D4 and it's a very very confrontational position right it is going to be black firing away over here with the pieces Rook C8 A6 B5 and it's going to be white trying to Checkmate on that side of the board and there it is look Leela starting its Counterattack with A6 B5 of course and here comes stockfish with F3 Here Comes B4 from Leela stockfish has to park its Knight and get hit with a rook move and I mean it looks like Leela's taking over the game I mean if anybody's got any sort of initiative here it is Leela stockfish just plays patient patient see just patiently expanding its pawns preventing black from getting counterplay in too much of a form Leela offers a trade of Bishops stockfish sacrifices a pawn it's not really a pawn sack because if you do this Knight D6 wins the game and F4 so too many threats there instead of that Knight F6 and now look at this we're poking we're poking at Leela we're playing H5 just a methodical expansion now black fights back now we slide out of the way now look at the look at this stockfish this stockfish thinks the position is equal Queen A5 Rook G1 just slowly pressuring taking your time sliding the queen forward looking for maybe bishop C2 and G5 Queen d8 now watch this this is an otherworldly level technique here from stockfish who realizes that its king is not quite safe enough and its Queen does not have a comfortable enough position it plays King to A1 and the idea of King to A1 is to then in a few moves go here because from here White's chances of attacking are maximized the queen was not comfortable on any Square on this diagonal you didn't want a queen trade you didn't want to be attacked and you didn't want to be attacked but from B1 the queen is a beacon it is like a lighthouse and now a few moves later Here Comes G5 and the attack is breaking through takes takes Bishop to D7 fighting off white now look at the Rooks the Rooks are coming the H Pawn the queen on B1 what an absolutely legendary idea King A1 Queen B1 I've never seen something like this and now the queen slides along the back rank you know why because it goes to H4 and then to F4 and now the queen has arrived it can be on B1 it then took a multiple stop itinerary and now it's ready now it's ready and here comes H6 H6 is a removal of the black defenses and the pawn goes to H7 as well now the king can't move now nobody can move the H file is still available for infiltration black plays Knight C4 and now the game is over at this point the game is officially over uh and and you don't even see it right like this doesn't even see like what what do you mean the game is over uh White is now going to very slowly and methodically slide back and sacrifice so for example Bishop H4 this Pawn cannot be taken with the Knight or the king you can't take it with the King because it's made can't take it with the Knight because it's the same problem Bishop takes and then so if you can't take the pawn on H7 do you know what the pawn on H7 is actually doing the pawn on H7 is actually stopping Rook to G8 because black would like to defend this Pawn but they can't so by playing Bishop to H4 black plays Rook C8 and now you go here and now it's over once we get all the pawns out of the way of the king white has 22 points of material barreling forward not going to stop that not going to stop that Queen H6 is coming and one of the fanciest ways that this game could conclude is something like Rook to G8 check just in the future or Rook G1 followed by R8 and it's just over and uh this is absolutely brutal black cannot stop this so black goes here sacrificing a knight to create a little bit of counterplay here to get you know some pieces back and we go to a little bit of an end game but it's just winning white just has an extra night and at stockfish level having an extra Knight is very good stockfish does not manage to lose this game trades off everything that night how long did that Knight stand on the edge of the board I'll tell you right now 38 moves white played Without a knight for 38 moves look at the Knight look at the Knight on A4 look at it I'm I'm pointing at look at it's not moving King A1 Queen B1 look at this white did all of that with a knight there that was just standing around just hanging around it did nothing and then on the 53rd move of the game when the dust had cleared Knight B6 and then the Knight three moves in a row Knight F6 E1 Queen we go to an end game being up a night is obviously very good and uh the game in this at this point uh ended by adjudication cuz they said Leela is not going to uh save this one that was crazy I mean I love the creativity displayed in these opposite you know because it looks like black is fighting back but the the most impressive thing here is definitely this just realizing that you can slide the queen back with the king in a little bunker and then play Rook G1 G5 and and Rook G1 again Rook H1 G5 just incredible I like I I I am flabbergasted at how good engine games are and and and how easy they make it look um this next one was a Dutch this was another one of the pairs and by the way uh let me know in the comments if you want to me to show you how Leela beats stockfish too because this is stockfish beating Leela but Leela actually in this in this t-c superfinal got as close as it ever did so let uh you know anyway D4 E6 a Dutch defense so a classical variation and now black plays this appro roach Bishop B4 and then Bishop 2 E7 normally what black will play is Knight F6 which is sort of interchangeable this move can happen at any point uh but then black will play Queen E7 to defend the bishop okay now the the Bots play this approach of bringing the bishop back and then playing in this way where you wait for white to block their own bishop and then you play Knight E4 and at this point uh the Bots left the book right here so this was all the pre-programmed stuff white has given a very slight Advantage as I think is normal uh in these uh computer games and in the Dutch is not a recommended opening at engine level at engine level the the weaknesses created by moving these pawns and potential pressure of the Bishops actually computers can exploit the Dutch quite well now a lot of you probably play The Dutch you go oh my God oh my God at 3700 level this is not a viable opening what will I ever do I'm only 1150 yeah shut up just shut up you can play The Dutch until 2800 okay when you're 2,800 you can re-evaluate uh the Dutch is great just not if you're 37 700 uh and and having said that stockfish Drew remember stockfish did not lose when it played the Dutch Leela lost spoiler D5 best move one of the most principled ways to fight actually against the Dutch takes Knight takes D5 and now we are going to have something here where the Knight grabs the bishop which generally look at look at browser based stockfish it already thinks the position is equal already thinks 0.1 point2 now watch as white methodically and slowly improves their position because of this pin just that just the fact that it is so hard for black to move the ca Pawn again most humans here with black like let's say you know white play like most humans here play Queen C7 and then they try to get you know this bishop off a little bit you you don't want to rush with a move like C5 because you lose that square so if the Knight gets to D5 white is positionally winning so you got to be patient right Queen E8 like look at that you know look at white just very slowly just very slowly improving the position now it's an engine so it plays H4 same side taking a little bit of space not really supposed to push Pawns in front of your king unless you're 3673 and now a very big transformation is about to occur stockfish takes it takes because even though the bishop is protected that is an isolated Pawn iqp isolated Queen's Pawn it's got no neighbors now the way you play against this is you blockade it you make sure it cannot go forward and right now it can black cannot go D4 black cannot go D4 because let's say Knight takes D4 Bishop takes G2 King takes G2 Bishop takes D4 e takes D4 and then if Rook takes D4 apparently this position is lost for black even though black gets the pawn back black now has to live in an apocalyptic world where they can't move the Knight Knight E5 is about to win Knight G5 is about to win Rook D7 is coming in at any moment the eval is only growing and growing look but I got my Pawn back yeah but what about Knight E7 yeah but I but I got my Pawn back yeah but what about F4 and then Queen C4 and then Rook D7 yeah but I got my Pawn back okay Knight C7 Queen A4 and look at this just Rook C1 just slowly slowly blocking the isolated Pawn slow methodical approach playing where you are stronger stockfish does not have to attack it just has to secure control of a certain Square that's all it has to do it is going to that square and then it's going to bring the other Knight into the center and then it's going to slide forward to keep an eye on the rook and then it's going to slide back to threaten to infiltrate on the a file that it's going to go Queen B3 because it's making you bounce around your pieces while poking right like a boxer it's poking at your defenses it's seeing where something is going to be possible Bishop F3 Queen B3 looking like everything has been stabilized but now we're going to go around that way we're going to go to F4 we're going to go to D5 so Leela takes the Knight but that is an unclogging of the dam because now Knight F4 and now Pawn to H5 and now after weakening this side of the board for 20 moves I've deflected your defenses and I'm in and look at this by the way stockfish is down a pawn stockfish is down a pawn but black has four isolated Pawn Islands four of them so they will all be hunted down Bishop F3 Rook D7 King G2 Rooks it's just a matter of time we're going to build build up our attack and that's it there's the attack there is no way for black to survive losing a pawn but it's very important white does not trade everything white does not trade everything if you trade everything your chances of Victory plummets if anybody's going to win this game by the way it might be black with the B Pawn okay not exactly but because just takes takes Knight F6 but that's why when you when you're trying to win an end game when you're trying to win an end game trade one pair of Rooks don't trade both don't trade both the more you trade the higher the drawing chances now white will still hunt the pawns and still hunt the light squares King H2 getting out of danger Queen B5 and we've won that pawn now now it's about simplification now we can trade now we don't mind trading the Rooks because Queen and Bishop is a winning combination Queen E5 check Queen F5 we've gotten all of our material back and now it's over and stockfish wins with Bishop E6 takes takes and of course Checkmate to follow what a game and I found this game absolutely fascinating from the positional standpoint because black had certain problems that they were simply not able to overcome but then this transformation allowed white to just play over here to get the Knight to D4 get the Knight to C6 get the other Knight to D4 while pressuring the position look at this white did not touch an entire side of the board White's just completely slowly it's very instru intive very instructive suffocating style and that H Pawn was ready a long time ago white played H4 on the 18th move and then a little while later when the attack was breaking through 25 moves later white played H5 so it's just amazing right 38 moves 25 moves everything stockfish does has a long-term purpose last game this one was a uh a queen's Indian defense Bishop B7 kaspar variation this line where black tries to trade very early so Leela plays like this and they left book here actually white move the king so this is also very common at engine in engine games they are not afraid of moving their King early why because this bishop is offside so now white is threatening to either kick it out or trap it trap it with something like A3 computers love to move their kings and then they'll play H4 G4 and like King G2 so they they they don't mind they love this stuff and um I think this is the first uh is the first uh move by the computer and not actually uh from uh not from a opening book and uh well same side castling couple of games ago we saw how it played opposite side castling here same side castling was a positional game this was a sacrifice yeah it doesn't matter Rook H look King on F1 Rook coming up to H3 to potentially go here and and it's it's got no in it's it's never going to stop pushing it's not going to stop pushing cuz black can't resist with pawns or pieces right so black plays Bishop F6 and stockfish does what it it's going to always push the pawn it's going to push the pawn as far as it can why because if you take your King's open so it's not even that I'm going to mate you although probably I will it's that your king is always going to be weak always and I'm going to try to get in here as fast as possible while you're defending yourself I'm going to get in and do some other damage if you push the pawn like what happens in the game that's going to be a weakness forever so I'm going to be able to exploit the H7 pawn and the weakness of your King right now I go back to the center I don't care that you can hit my queen because I want this position and now I'm going to play A3 and Rook E1 so for example A3 Knight C6 I'm going to play something like Rook D1 and then I'm going to slowly prepare my next wave of attack while this Pawn is a thorn it's not letting black actually survive the middle game and it's causing black all sorts of endgame problems as well so black tries to fight back with D5 takes takes Bishop gets out of the way and now stockfish has a Target and not only that it is controlling a square with five pieces five pieces control E5 so that is called a backwards Pawn it's called a backwards Pawn King G1 sliding out of the way now it looks like we've castled it looks like we Castle but this Rook never left the never left the castle Leela tries to trade the Bishops and now this Rook just happily slides back does not care because Here Comes Knight E5 and Rook F5 now again if stockfish does not manage to win this game by attacking you know what it's going to do it's going to go to an end game Rooks and knights it's GNA go to how but how's it going to prove an advantage here like how do you know white has any advantage this Pawn is good it's controlling a lot of squares it's not letting you know it's not letting anything happen but how you going to okay Rook C1 but how are you going to get rid of the Knight that's guarded by the white can't even white has no pawns how you going to get rid of it well we're going to just SL slowly take squares away from our opponent we're going to play G4 now the rook's got to move now we offer a trade we offer a trade to improve our structure if black doesn't want to trade we go King G3 black can't go too far why can't black go too far Knight takes G6 so if the Rooks didn't exist and the King went too far boom and boom that's the problem black plays G5 now Knight C6 Rook F6 and now perhaps the most impressive moment of the entire game instead of taking like this with your Rook hanging and giving away that pawn stockfish sacrifices The Rook what why here's why because the Knight dominates both Rooks the Knight also prevents any counterplay if you go here I go ight E5 and the pawns are too far Advanced stockfish calculates 50 moves into the future at this point and realizes black can't do anything if black plays King E8 I will go G5 or Rook G5 I will go Rook G5 it doesn't even matter I'll play Rook G5 and if you go to get my my my I'll go Knight E5 and then I'll play Rook G and that's it once I win this my pawns are to far advance so stockfish sees 50 moves into the future and realizes black can't do anything black can play Rook D7 but if black plays Rook D6 I'll just play Rook C1 if black plays King E8 and King D7 I'll play Knight A7 removing the defender of the C7 pawn and Knight B5 Knight here it it there is no way for the Rooks to escape the nightmare no pun intended Rook D5 G5 Rook C1 look at this black is completely hopeless as white just walks forward seizing control of everything B5 you cannot get rid of the Knight and now I'm going to come knocking on the door and when I do it is all over I reposition my knight to D7 to F6 King E5 Rook G1 look at the Rooks absolutely defenseless stockfish is just toying with its food it gets in Rook G8 and now one of the most disrespectful conclusions to a chess game I have ever seen Knight H7 check and stockfish says no I'm not going to take your Rook if I take your Rook I'm not winning instead you take my Rook King F6 forces The Rook to move if takes then takes and I promote if Rook here I block and if King F6 Rook to D7 that's mate you push your own King to his death King F6 is so brutal and Leela just plays any move that it can Rook E7 check King F7 and uh it's just a matter of Time stockfish Marches forward F5 King E6 and this one does get played out until a Checkmate F7 f8 mate when stockfish decided to sacrifice its Rook over over here it completely knew it was over it knew there was no way for the king or for the Rooks to create any meaningful counterplay Rook here Rook here would always anchor the night and the pawns would dominate the advanced pawns and that is why it is so impressive that early in the game it plays H4 because it knows in certain structures samide castling with multiple pieces traded if it can get its Pawn deep into its opponent's territory it's going to potentially cause long-term damage and it did it did cause long-term damage in fact that pawn is the literal reason that white won the game these games are otherworldly like in incredible absolutely incredible Leela does manage to beat stockfish I think more than any bot in the world we'll see how strong torch can get but um stockfish is still The Undefeated Undisputed unless they bring back Alpha zero they haven't but they might you know um that's all I have for you if you're in London check out some of the fan events I hope to see some of you soon and I'm coming to Toronto likely December 7th follow me on Instagram follow me on Twitter I will be announcing that stuff uh here but also on those platforms and uh I will see you all very soon in London uh and um that's all get out of here
