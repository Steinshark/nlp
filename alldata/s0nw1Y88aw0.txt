do you have concerns about the future of AI all the different trajectories of all of our research yes where's your hope where the movement has were your concerns I'm concerned because I know we are building a new species it has a capability of exceeding our exceeding us exceeding our capabilities and can breed itself and take over the world absolutely if you know species it is uncontrolled we don't know the degree to which we control it we don't even understand what it means to be able to control these new species so I'm concerned I don't have anything to add to them because it's such a great area unknown it never happened in history yeah the only the only time it happened in history was evolution with human being it was very successful was it separately said it was a great thing for us it was but a few people along the way a few creatures along the way would not agree so so it's just because it's such a gray area there's nothing else to say we have a sample of one sample of one it's us but we don't let people look at you and say yeah but we were looking to you to help us make sure that the sample 2 works out ok we have more than samples more we have theory of theories yeah and that's a good we don't need to be statisticians so sample of mine doesn't mean me poverty of knowledge it's not sample of one-plus feeling conjectural theory of what could happen that we do have but I really feel helpless in contributing to this argument because I know so little in the and my imagination is limited and I know how much I don't know and I but I'm concerned you
