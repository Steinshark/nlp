let's get back to the video thanks sponsored Gotham folks this chess game features two individuals right around the advanced beginner level right around the early intermediate level who played a daily game against each other seemingly friends they've played each other multiple times their names are Jon and baffo one of their names is definitely stranger than the other but I don't think that is their legal name unless it is in which case sorry for making fun of it uh baffo we are going to witness the game from baffle's perspective uh with the black pieces and this was a daily game and the game began with the move E4 and black played the move E5 Bishop C4 on the board The Bishop's opening uh potentially The Bishop's opening potentially a transposition back to more normal stuff like Knight F3 or white is just going to go for formal Checkmate now as always in my videos we're gonna laugh it's not really a how to lose it chess video like not a lot of dumb things happen uh more so we're gonna learn a few things we're gonna laugh and we're gonna see something historic alright so sit back and relax Knight F6 so now there is no Queen H5 now here white plays a move that I it's not a losing move but it's not a good move uh White plays the move F3 I'm just gonna say this right now you really rarely if ever want to play the move Pawn to F3 in the first like five moves of the game um it happens in very specific openings frequently when you're putting a bishop there in this case you're just getting in the way of your own Knight you're also weakening your king the dark squares to your king this is just not a very good move now the best way to play against this move is for black to actually strike at the center right away because white has not built any Equity here so even the move D5 here is very good for black and white just can't develop because they got in their own way now black plays Knight C6 white plays C3 so clearly Jon has already something prepared uh and white actually plays uh relatively normal moves right and now he's ready to go D4 now again at any given moment the best thing for black to do is to put two Pawns in the center if possible but Bishop c592 white wants to play the move d4 now black plays D6 and white actually did everything right white played C3 white played Knight E2 and if white plays D4 in this position White's not even worse in fact like I said if you play Pawn F3 and get a bishop here and then a night out you're like your position's good computer doesn't like this move because of Pawn to D5 but the computer can go eat a Frank so uh instead of all that instead of playing 92 C3 and very clearly preparing the move d4 keep in mind this is a daily game they have 72 hours to make a move clearly John got distracted and he plays F4 now he's just dead lost I mean maybe listen Maybe Jon played the move F4 during a period of vicious diarrhea like I don't know you know um maybe he was 71 and a half hours into the 72 hours and was like oh my God I have to make a move and then he sat down on the toilet he had explosive diarrhea and he didn't remember this so he played this that move is just losing uh it's losing because it hangs upon uh not only does it hang a pawn it hangs upon and very vicious King safety like you played F3 already so you're just moments away from losing now so after his bout with violent diarrhea Jon bounces back and plays the move d4 and he is still lost but he is not as lost as he would be had he allowed the Knight to go to F2 now what black should do here is open up the position as fast as possible because he has a very strong attack so right now this Pawn trade thoroughly benefits black uh to the extent that he even has tactics like this which is very hard to see what this does is remove the knight from the defense of the G3 Square and now Queen H4 is vicious and you can even do this and then you can take on H1 and you know you can take the queen and then you can take the Knight and you're completely winning uh in fact if the King goes to E2 you also have this so the point of Knight takes D4 is deflecting the knight from the defensive G3 so that Queen H4 is possible otherwise the Knight would have been defending that but Bishop B6 now white plays Rook F1 which is kind of a deranged move like why would you not castle and run the king to the corner okay Rook F1 whatever who am I to judge uh Now default now castles and here white plays the move uh D5 attacking the Knight uh now Queen H4 check for black is just like winning on the spot uh Queen H4 G3 and then black even has Maiden 2 here uh Bishop F2 and queen F2 black also can sack the queen for absolutely no reason and then made in three with Bishop H3 which would be very pretty ah but he does this Bishop D3 and again Knight F2 Queen H4 like black is completely winning black is a pawn up uh White's King is very weak and if you're sitting there wondering where is this historic moment that happens in this game it it doesn't it doesn't happen in the first 10 10 moves it doesn't you gotta have a little patience all right so yeah have some patience Bozo Bishop F5 uh and now this trade now that is not a good trade now how do you evaluate that like how do you evaluate what's a good trade and what is it well you got to get better at your middle games gotta watch some of my middle games concept videos uh or get you know get them you know what I'm saying um anyway uh this is not a good trade because this is White's really only active piece and you are now trading it uh I would have much preferred you know something like Knight D2 and maybe trying to trade like this even then black is doing very well this trade is just not good because white can't develop any pieces now White's next move is Pawn to B4 that move makes sense but black just keeps moving forward so now it's -6 even though black is only up one point of material this position is -6 how how is that possible how are you down six points of material well you have very bad development you have holes in your position your king is very weak and because your king is very weak black at any given moment can start winning more material like this Pawn or that pawn or that pawn or your king So Knight A3 uh now this trade is completely fine for black and now black can take a pawn and actually trap The Rook The Rook cannot go anywhere so Bishop takes G2 wins the pawn and traps The Rook black can also play Queen H4 check but I can also play Pawn takes F4 and open up this uh black does in fact play the move Queen H4 and he does take on H2 and this is a very very bad situation for white who is now down two Pawns and not only is down two pawns uh is uh is just thoroughly thoroughly thoroughly under attack the king is under severe pressure at some point Pawn takes F4 and opening up The Rook on the e-file is going to be vicious and it's just very bad news Bishop E3 will cut the circulation even further uh Queen D2 played a well-timed move now Bishop E3 is not possible again if I'm playing Black here I'm opening up the position I'm putting a rook on the E file if I'm playing Black here which I'm not uh because I would win also because I have no friends who want to play me in chess or friends period uh if I'm playing Black here I'm either taking the pawn or trying to trap the Rogue Blacklist this which is definitely a legal move it's not a bad move and then he does this so now black is up three pawns and he might Target that one he's got eyes on this he could open that up the bishop can come in when that square is defended and pin the king to the queen now the way you fight back here uh by the way if you're sitting there wondering what about Queen takes D5 uh this so maybe he got lucky or maybe he's a genius in any case Queen takes D5 Queen takes a knight and he's in good shape so black is completely winning uh now the way you fight back here with white I don't really know to be honest in a in a in a Time game you try to play fast but this is a daily game there is no playing fast when each side has 72 hours to make a move uh White could try to create an attack over here on the king side white could try to bring the bishop back and try it with that's really the only way Knight G1 um I would just trade Queens here and then like trade Bishop for night and that's one of the ways to win another way to win is uh Queen G3 and try to do this but if you play Queen G3 you might accidentally you know hang your Bishop now that actually happens black goes here and is now up four pawns that's a lot of Pawns and that threatens this uh this is a good move I don't know if white saw it I don't think white saw it it's not the best move because then black will be up Five Pawns and then black is still gonna win a bishop so black is gonna be up Five Pawns it's crazy but it's true instead of that white plays King B1 which avoids this at least winning the queen but after Bishop E3 you're still gonna be down upon so look check King to the corner Bishop E3 Queen E2 and now black can just do this and be up six pawns not just six pawns seven pawns potentially and maybe eight just winning all the pawns uh not six pawns black can be up Five Pawns then win this one be up six Pawns uh D5 Knight F3 and Bishop takes F4 black has eight pawns and white has three I mean this is a mismatch of Epic Proportions uh baffo's doing an excellent job and then of the I don't like that like if I'm being on just trade the Queens trade the Queens trade the Bishops win this position just go to the end game don't hang a rook put the Rooks behind the pawns and just push the pawns the game becomes much easier to win when your opponent has no pieces on the board all right but okay Queen back to G6 you know why I don't like this move because Rook G1 and you never know you never know you never know when by accident you're gonna like hang a mate or something all right I don't know it's very difficult to do that but you might do it anyway white plays Bishop C1 I would chop the bishop I would chop the Knight I wouldn't even hesitate okay he chops the bishop he doesn't chop the Knight just take the Knight there's no because look if you let the Knight survive now all of a sudden the Knight is attacking the queen right now the queen goes to E6 all right great why does you know I would play Rook G1 Rook F1 that's what I would do queen E2 look the longer you wait the higher chance something stupid happens you could have traded the bishop for the night instead you hung the bishop so a long time ago John got trapped in the toilet with violent diarrhea uh and uh yeah I think his opponent didn't have diarrhea I think his opponent just forgot that when he pushed this Pawn you know he probably calculated take take and I'm defended but he didn't calculate just this now he's almost lost and I say almost lost because on the very next move he is in fact lost like folks you have to understand it's very nice that stockfish says that it's -6 but you are not stockfish you need to be able to understand where the advantages lie in the position that that is just the reality all right where is the advantages the pawns and it's the safety of the king and that is why back here don't over complicate things there is absolutely nothing wrong with this and then you just Avalanche the pawns you cannot lose that position whereas when your Bishop is on the board you have a chance of losing it and now white goes back but white should have went to F5 and just hunted your king and if you go G6 Knight H6 it's bad to worse like the evaluation just swells and the problem for uh black earlier in the game was that black was better but there was a lot of pieces on the board whereas if you allow this ain't there ain't no pieces on the board man you're just getting mated like you your king is gonna get pulled out of the castle beaten to a pulp and left on the side of the road all right so but okay Knight F3 back now however black decides to win a different type of game black in this position tries to win Connect Four F6 and now we are nearing the historic moment of this game in this position white played the move Rook H1 setting up very nasty intentions to Black's King Fantastic move by the way black played the move H6 now what white should have done here is played Knight H4 brought the Rooks over here and just butchered black instead they played Queen G4 which is not a bad move the computer doesn't like it because the things you can Queen trade but black plays A5 and black is really just trying to lose the game I mean there is a cannon being pointed straight at the black king Knight H4 Knight F5 looking very juicy white here starts like shuffling back and forth and black finally breaks into the position with Pawn takes B4 and uh as you can see by the way that Rook is also staring at something and it's about to get real nasty white plays Rook H6 so what John did with white is he got tunnel vision he tried this a few times he tried to set up rook takes H6 on multiple occasions uh and then he like kind of got it he like he could have done it earlier but by the time he got it oh yes yes the pawn chain baby G7 F6 E5 D4 C3 look at this gorgeous Pawn chain and the rook and the Queen and now it's actually black who is threatening the mate Rook B1 now of course a mistake here for black would be to break the pawn chain but he does it he plays C2 with the intention of playing Rook takes B6 C1 Queen which would have been very fancy uh now he could move the Rook for some reason though John doesn't realize that and just loses The Rook I don't know why he did that he could have just moved it there was no bait uh I think he had Tunnel Vision on Queen B2 and now Queen and unfortunately the pawn chain has been slain however however in the Final Act of this incredible battle between baffo and John or John and baffo win A5 was played Rook H2 back and white realized that he's not gonna mate black even if he gets in because the king can always Escape you just need more pieces than this that's why the Knight had to go to F5 Ponto C5 Queen H5 comes in black runs but he doesn't even have to check King F7 check King E6 and the King hides among the Pawns the pawns cover the king now if White Knight could get to C4 it would be good knight D2 Knight C4 but white plays Queen F3 Pawn to B5 Pawn to A3 Pawn to C4 Rook A2 defending the king Rook ea7 completely unnecessary but he plays it Now Pawn to B4 and white is unable to use this because then he would get absolutely brutalized on the a file but so Pawn to A4 and folks I think if you've watched this video long enough you know where we are headed in this game we got a historic Pawn chain I have never seen this in my life I've seen five I ain't never seen six Pawn to B3 a few moves later Pawn to B2 and on the 50th move of this game in this position white played the move Pawn to C3 now the incredible thing about this position is that that's a fork in this position seeing that the fork was coming black had the option to move the queen and sacrifice the pawn and not get the pawn chain but instead black played C3 and sacrificed his queen with the intention of getting the pawn chain look at this and he's not even worse he's not even worse that's the craziest part about this position in this position after something like Rook A1 check it is actually white who is lost because a rook cannot stop this many pawns it's just not possible so it's absolutely ridiculous C3 Knight C4 despite be about to lose a queen you are still winning this game apparently instead of King C5 you have to go here but my point stands which is so insane the legendary six Pawn chain all the way down they all defend each other and they make it very difficult for white to move any pieces because at any given moment you might Force the king out and even on top of that white doesn't play the move Knight C4 oh poor John I think John played like half this game while having like big poopies in his like office or something his corporate office black plays Queen D5 and yeah now uh now the now the situation unfortunately um will in fact resolve in the favor of black who really does his best here not to move any of the pawns he gets to this position it's just beautiful stuff can we just take a moment and admire it um and the pawn chain does in fact break a little bit later Queen A1 King C2 and uh black plays the move Pawn to D3 deflecting the king from the back rank if King C3 there is B1 Queen if King D3 there's B1 Queen Pawn to D3 and white resign this game seeing as though he was about to allow about five different Queens to promote what an absolutely aesthetic position the fact that you can get a pawn chain of six pawns and Knight to C4 check would have won the queen and even with that it is still winning because the pawns all bind together for example there is counter play that you can create but by the time you do it I'm promoting and when the dust settles I'm up four pawns I'm not counting this I'm up four pawns so very very nice game uh why didn't this game played a very strange opening and didn't take the center when necessary you need to put two Pawns in the center quickly if you can if you can you really should uh White got a very weak King position found themselves in a situation down two pawns three pawns even in just under severe pressure four pawns even uh didn't simplify quickly enough lost the bishop and for a few moves was losing white should have went forward uh you know to counteract this white should have went forward but white went backwards gave black time to consolidate and then black managed to create an absolutely Sensational Pawn chain six Pawns in a row incredible stuff that's all I have for you today I'll see you in the next video get out of here
