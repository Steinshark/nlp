there is no surprise or secret that a lot of jobs have been lost because of Technology but on the flip side a lot of jobs have been created today we are going to go through some of the jobs that are not doing so well because of Technology future Tech coming out jobs that will be lost but on the flip side new jobs of the future that will be created this will hopefully give you insight as to where to put your focus if you are someone who is interested in these future jobs and maybe even jobs you haven't heard of that are going to potentially well they will exist all right before we get into it though hit that subscribe button leave any comments or questions you have let's get into it do you know what though is a really interesting job that has survived in Tech through so many different iterations and Evolutions the bigger question though is will it survive the AI Evolution the answer is it will can you guess what I'm talking about no surprise here it is software Ware developer I mean think about all the stages software developers have gone through let's take a minute and kind of go back in time for a second to see the evolution of the software developer I think this is important because it does a really good job of just showing how important it is to what you are doing today might be so different if you are staying in this role uh whether you're a software developer or otherwise and how it evolves and rather than pushing away new technologies such as AI learning to embrace them all right let's get into it in the early days of computing software developers often worked on highly specialized systems writing code in low-level languages like assembly or machine code and this work was really laborous and very timec consuming honestly I don't think I would have wanted to be a software developer back then then we got the introduction of the highlevel languages thank goodness which started out with things such as Fortran cobal and then later things like C Java um even python which of course as we know allowed for developers to write code in a more human readable format which of course sped up development then introducing the world of ID IDE IDE yeah these tools honestly were an area that allowed for more automation this is one of the first times I think anyways that we really see automation with coding starting to align together okay we could keep on going throughout all the different Technologies but the point of this exercise is to show you just how far software development has come thanks to technology with new technologies coming out even back when higher level programming languages came out I'm sure at the time their response was oh my goodness this is anyone now can program it's going to not be in demand it's too humanlike but we got past it and we're going to get past this AI Evolution 2 a lot of new low code tools are being introduced which will help us code faster better and in turn be able to create more really interesting products or that's the Hope anyways all right I got to sit down here next up I want to take you through some roles that will exist in the future roles that don't exist today or are just on the brink of starting to be in demand and needed a lot of these roles will come out of Ai No Surprise here but there will be roles that are Technical and non-technical so no matter where your skill level is out with that there is a role for you in the future the first one being robotics sports coach yes this is very specific being a sports coach for robotics like what does that even look like the interesting thing is why I added this onto the list is because I don't know if you've seen this video clip I'm going to share it with you right now of uh this robot playing tennis with humans now this is not real this is just generated online uh but it just shows you and it really prompted a lot of people to start thinking about what is it like when we get to the point that robots are at a level where they can play sports with us do we allow that do we not allow that that's a whole other topic of question but being a robot sports coach is very specific so let's take it back back a bit and say a robot manager in general and this is definitely something that will be needed in the future someone who is skilled in dealing with this Hardware but also to the AI side of things and interacting with these robots being able to manage them whether it be they're working at say a Starbucks or in the sports area I know this sounds so strange but when you really start thinking about it we are pretty close to there I mean if you go over to Japan now you see a lot of these robots will take your orders they're not necessarily in the form of uh a human per se but it's really interesting to start thinking about that we could be managing robots in our lifetime the next one is really interesting for anyone who is passionate about cyber security this is called a personal privacy adviser and these I would say roles already kind of uh are implemented in our world today just with varying titles and what these individuals will do is help individuals navigate the complex world of digital privacy so ensuring their online activities and data remain secure honestly I feel feel like I would hire someone to help me with that understanding better how I can be the most secure I possibly can so this is a role that although it's listed as something that will be in demand in new role in the future I think today this is something we're already seeing in cyber security okay this next Ro already exists to varying degrees but it will continue to become more and more in demand this is a virtual reality experience designer now before you go oh Tiff VR is just not going to take off we've tried for so long so many years have you seen that interview going around with Mark Zuckerberg and Lex fredman on his podcast essentially what it is is they are in the metaverse and talking to each other and it's so fascinating to me I'll share it with you on screen here Lex's response to this he is literally blown away as to how real it feels that he thinks he's in the room with Mark I mean he knows he's not but it just feels so real watching that video made me really think that VR might be on something VR might be the future and with that the role RS for VR will continue to be into M the really good thing about this role though is you can take so many existing skills either technical design product management and apply them into this role based on past experience the next one sounds like a really fun job something I think I would really like which is AI personality developer so what does this person do this person has to be very knowledgeable about generative AI understanding how the models work how the technology Works behind the AI and what their focus is is training these models to feel like they have a personality as technology starts becoming more and more close to our daily lives humans want to interact with things they are familiar with and one of those things is if we're interacting with AI we want it to feel as though it is human whether we'll admit to it or not we like familiarity another thing for this role is you will have to have really good skills in understanding human interaction so you need to be someone as you are training this AI to have more of that humanlike personality that understands uh human Psy pschology and social interactions these jobs sound kind of fluffy when you first say them but when you really think as to what the requirements are these are very highly skilled roles for example in the role you would need to understand natural language processing you'd work closely with the NLP Engineers to ensure that ai's language understanding and generation are actually in sync with the designed personality so if you are someone who's going to be speaking and working closely with these Engineers you need to understand the tech behind it maybe not to the level where you are building it but have a deep understanding about it all right those are some really fun jobs or interesting jobs and I hope the purpose uh that you or the outtake or outcome of these when I'm sharing them with you that you got is that there are so many jobs that don't exist today that will in the future and the most important thing is continuing to level up and being open to these really quirky interesting roles I think one of the things is we often feel as though we need to put ourselves in a bucket okay I am going to specialize in this and this way only when in reality yes that is great to be a specialist because what that will do is continue to allow you to I need to get water continue to allow you to grow in that specialty whether it be cyber security or data or uh AI but the other thing about this too is even when you are specialized there is so many opportunities that will come your way that we don't even know exist some of my favorite resources for learning to continue to upscale one being you to me I love you to me and I think I love it so much because you can see what the courses are rated and more than that you can see how many people rated the courses so I always go for a high rating but a high rating that has a lot of people rating it to really ensure it's a really good course if you are looking to get into coding I would definitely suggest checking out free code camp they're free they have amazing resources as well structured lessons and um their instructors are really great as well and if you are someone who is just looking to stay up toate on Tech here are some of my favorite newsletters on screen best way in my opin opinion to stay up on Tech is through newsletters that get delivered to your inbox it's really the easiest way and doesn't require a lot of work another question I get asked a lot is well Tiff I'm really interested in technology or programming but I don't know where to put my focus how do I know what will be in demand yes we just went through some jobs but how do I know and the best way is through keeping up to date through these newsletters but also to just being aware as things come down the pipeline I mean with AI we've been seeing a lot of python right now and that's something that we saw a lot with data science as well so I think that is a really great programming language to pick up but it really depends on what you want to focus on at the end of the day though if you are doing your due diligence as to what companies are hiring for what is in demand you aren't going to go wrong because the one thing about tech is even if you learn something and it becomes outdated it is the building block to the next piece of technology to make you an expert in all right I hope you enjoyed this video and going along with me for some future jobs I I just I love thinking about the future and what it can entail what are some other jobs of the future I didn't list that you think will exist leave in the comments oh and hit that subscribe button all right bye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] everyone
