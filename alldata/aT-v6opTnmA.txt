it's no secret that you can make a lot of 
money working in tech it's so important   though that you ensure to educate yourself on 
what salary to expect what really is included   in total compensation and so much more today 
i'm going to be sharing with you some of the   best resources to look for and do research on when 
you are looking for a tech job or maybe you are   transitioning into a new role but before we get 
into it make sure to hit that subscribe button   for more tech and coding related content shout 
out to some of these subscribers here thank you   for your comments questions feedback love you 
know i love you okay let's get right into it whether you are someone who is first entering into 
the tech industry or maybe you are someone who's   mid or senior level looking to get a different job 
being up to date and ensuring you are educated on   what salary or total compensation is expected 
throughout the industry is absolutely key to   ensuring setting yourself up for success before 
we get into some of the best resources to research   tech salaries let's really break down what a 
tech salary or should i say total compensation   really entails to put it simply total compensation 
includes all the different ways that you get paid   so it's more than just your salary some examples 
of total compensation can include base salary   benefits bonus stock options but let's break 
them down even further okay let's start with base   salary something that we are all familiar with 
base salary is something that you are guaranteed   to get regardless of your performance or working 
extra hard anything like that this is your base   salary something that you are guaranteed to have 
okay that's pretty obvious let's jump into bonus   a bonus is essentially a percentage or often 
done as a percentage of your base salary so   for example let's say 10 to 15 percent and unlike 
base salary this is not fixed every year so it may   vary year to year usually a bonus is given out 
once a year so for example a lot of companies   give up bonuses at end of year based on your 
performance and hitting target goals okay another   big piece of total compensation is equity and 
this is where it gets a little bit more complex   the essential goal of having equity compensation 
is that employees see as long as the company   is doing good and furthering doing good their 
equity compensation continues to rise so it's   kind of incentive for employees to really want 
to see the company succeed equity compensation   is essentially a strategy that is used to improve 
a business's cash flow and a lot of times startups   offer equity instead of a salary and it really 
depends on how much you believe in the startup but   i would also say higher level companies really 
offer equity on top of the salary as well included   in the total compensation package and the last one 
i want to talk about is benefits benefits include   health benefits dental benefits different benefits 
that you can use throughout the year the goal   of benefits is that when you have benefits they 
will offset a lot of expenses that you would have   otherwise if you were to pay out of pocket the key 
with benefits though is you actually have to use   them more often than not we think we have these 
great benefit packages and they kind of lure us   in with that only for us to go throughout the year 
with really not using them all such as massages or   extra spending health benefits but when 
you need them they really come in handy   okay now that we have a pretty good understanding 
as to what a tech salary or tech compensation   really includes let's dive into some of the top 
salary or total compensation tech reporters these   are two resources that i use all the time i'm 
always looking because they do two things one   they go based on location where are you 
located two it's based on other people   actually inputting their salaries which i think 
is huge to actually hear from you know your peers   working in the industry what they are making the 
first site i want to talk about is levels.fyi   i am sure you have heard about it before and if 
you haven't i highly suggest you go check it out   i recently discovered levels fyi maybe 
a year and a half ago up until then i   didn't even know it existed i don't know 
how i was living in a rock or under a rock   and what they do is they really highlight 
in different areas of tech different jobs   in tech different salaries and total compensation 
so they do both they will break it down from your   base salary and then they also will include if you 
were to include a bonus and equity on top of that   okay i'm going to pull it up right here this 
is a home page for me when i go to levels.fyi   and you can see here they go right into some of 
the top companies google facebook microsoft you   can toggle here to see different roles for this 
video let's stick with software engineer as i know   a lot of you are software engineers so let's go by 
location well let's go to san fran obviously this   is going to be significantly higher than other 
areas in the world because it's a tech hub but   it's really good to understand what they 
are paying there i also think it's key on   levels.fyi how they do by level so you can really 
research based on what level you are going into   uh to have an understanding of what to expect 
so if we go to say l1 netflix view full offer and you can see here what they are reporting 
is 170 and then with a bonus of 3 000.   and it really goes on and on i mean there's 
1500 different reports so some are more accurate   than others of course but it kind of gives you i 
really like up here where it gives you immediate   median of what to expect and you can also see 
the top paying companies which is really huge   and then if we go just for fun let's go to the 
top paying report of 2020. i wonder if this is   what you expected i didn't expect lyft to 
be number one to be honest but as you can   see the headquarters um are obviously most of 
them are out of san fran and the compensation   the total compensation please do not skew this 
with the base salary this is total compensation   that we spoke about so let's go to lyft 230 base 
salary is 136 we have stocks and we have bonuses also i love how they have different 
kind of services they offer   from one-on-one salary negotiation support and 
in-depth resume review i'm just a huge fan of   this company this is not sponsored by any means i 
just am kind of obsessed with have these resources   they provide and being on top and having the 
education needed to negotiate your salary or   your total compensation and with resources 
like this it really empowers the employee to   have an understanding of what others are getting 
paid and what they should be expecting to   okay let's move on to the second one that i love 
which is blind this is great especially if you   want to compare salaries from company to company 
so once again with blind you can select a company   i find with blind they really focus on higher 
level companies or when i say higher level i   mean more kind of bang like companies they also 
do microsoft salesforce uber that kind of thing   but once again they have a ton of different 
roles let's go to software engineering again   you can also search for example like your based 
on what you're currently getting and submit it so   with blind i like it because a lot of people 
submit their current total compensation   so you're hearing from people who are actually 
working in the industry and also too if you're   looking for a job under who's hiring they have 
tons of different jobs where to apply and these   are for some of the biggest companies in the world 
and there are jobs that are located throughout the   entire world it's not just like a san fran kind 
of uh thing if you're in india if you are in   where else do we have we have tons of remote 
jobs we have a lot of for north america i mean   it's just a very valuable resource and i've been 
using blind for a while now once again i think i   found out about it around the same time as levels 
fyi and these are two resources that have honestly   changed my if i was to go and get another job i 
mean i love where i'm at and all that but if i   was to go through the job hunting and interviewing 
process these are the two resources i would use   hands down they are accurate they are up-to-date 
they are from people who are working in the   industry so it's kind of a win-win on all fronts i 
really hope this will help you if you are someone   looking to enter into the tech industry and not 
really sure what salary or total compensation to   expect but also too if you already are in the 
tech industry and you're like me just didn't   know about these resources i hope it will 
really help you or give you an understanding   for when you're getting promoted or looking for a 
new job as what salary to negotiate and to expect   if you haven't already make sure to give this 
video a thumbs up and subscribe leave in the   comments other videos you want me to make 
and i will see you soon thanks everyone you
