ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the freestyle chess challenge here in February of 2024 today is February 16th and today we will Crown a champion Magnus Carlson is playing Fabiano Carana today is their second classical game if this game ends in a draw just like it did yesterday they will play rapid playoffs our third place match is nobec Abdu satoro versus leavon aronian our fifth and sixth place match is Ali Roa fuja versus gukesh and our seventh and eighth place match is Vincent kimer Hometown hero from Germany uh versus dingl Ren the reigning defending champion of the world now before we get into this recap just a couple of things I'm going to apologize for number one uh they are doing some sort of cleaning and there is like non-stop noise behind me so if at any point you hear something uh apologies uh second thing is I actually got food poisoning last night so I went to this great event here in in uh in Charlotte North Carolina met a bunch of uh chess fans signed a bunch of books and then I decided to sit down and have some food uh and I got food poisoning so I did not sleep the whole night basically I woke up every hour uh and I'm you know just strong enough to actually walk from my bed here so if uh this is not the typical Gotham that you are used to I do apologize uh but I'm doing my best now the story of dingly Ren yesterday dingly Ren lost to Vincent kimer bringing his record in this event to three draws and nine losses which is absolutely nuts now if ding wins this game uh he ties Vincent and then they will play a rapid tie break uh if he draws or he loses then he finishes the event in eighth place and we have uh of course uh Fisher random uh chess 960 starting position so white has the two Bishops here the two knights in the corner interesting actually white can Castle on the first move but ding plays D4 score D5 and as early as the third move he does in fact commit his King and uh it's an interesting decision of course because you don't have to I mean you can try to play uh to open up your flank king and queen uh ra rather your rook and queen it's the food poisoning talking I don't know chess pieces anymore uh that's what the engine always likes to do but he castles and then a couple of moves later uh Vincent castles as well so we have the following position from the opening now just keep in mind Vincent does not have to win Vincent won yesterday so it's got to be ding who takes the fight to Vincent he plays Knight C3 Vincent captures the pawn on e4 and then utilizes this pin right away uh to put pressure on ding's uh Knight and queen of course ding defends and now we have Bishop D5 by Vincent Bishop D5 is a very interesting move by the way uh I think it it he kind of wanted to avoid various Knight A5 ideas so if the bishop just develops here white will play Knight A5 he can play C4 in the future and this bishop will get a little bit stuck so this way uh Vincent is winning the battle for the light squares in the center now we have H4 Bishop D2 Bishop F4 and from the early opening I mean visually White's position looks quite strong but apparently it's not and apparently this bishop maneuver caused ding a full point of evaluation which is kind of nuts like I don't get why apparently he should have put his Bishop on E3 because right away there's Knight C6 and not only is there Knight C6 there's A5 and it is actually surprisingly challenging to meet Black's incoming pawn attack on your king like the possibility of a queen side attack is actually very very brutal so we have Knight C3 take take and he just plays A4 and ding is completely lost again in about 12 moves and this yeah again I mean just absolutely shocking stuff the queen in the corner the Knight and the Rook all converge on this Pawn so Vincent wins a pawn and then he trades Rooks Bishop G7 we have take take uh and a couple of moves later ding will in fact win this Pawn back on A4 but Vincent plays Queen D6 and he's not worse and queen D2 is a massive threat which you cannot actually meet you just have to deal with the ramifications of the position afterward Knight C3 Rook E3 and uh black is just completely dominant I mean his Knight is really powerful the queen and Rook are powerful plays Queen here setting up this move King A2 Rook D2 and just absolutely surgical Precision Rook D2 played Knight D4 and here is on the way and uh ding resigns and that ends dingl Ren's tournament uh Vincent defeats him two to nothing in the Seventh Place match gets Seventh Place ding ends the event with three draws and 10 defeats which I'm not really going to talk much more about because I don't have the energy but that is um yeah I just really feel for the guy and uh I really hope ding returns to form that's I I've been saying it time and time and again again in these Recaps but uh clearly not his event and obviously very difficult to play a match when there's nothing really to be gained now gesh does have something to gain the winner of this match for fifth and sixth place gets an invitation to the next edition of this event now granted this event is Invitational um but at least that way you secure it so even if you didn't make the top four I think the rule is that if you make the top five you get an invitation into the next edition of the event now yesterday gukesh lost all right and of course our next two games are third fourth and then the championship game so goes needs to beat alyza uh these guys play actually a very similar looking setup in fact almost identical to this game like E4 E6 so very similar structure and gukesh brings out both his Knights take take and actually Ali Resa does the exact same thing that Vincent did so it's very interesting that they decide to play in a very similar way in fact it's the same position after eight Moves In fact it's the same position after eight and a half moves uh because in this game we had H4 as well but here Vincent went G4 uh alira takes on H4 to open up his Rook as opposed to keeping it closed that's very interesting right the way like obvious there's no openings in chess 960 that we know of yet but aliv Resa trades the bishop brings out his Knight and in the previous game black went on a big attack here but that's mostly because white kind of took his Bishop off the diagonal that's not going to happen here we have Bishop E7 and queen F6 but from from from this position actually GES can begin targeting this Pawn I mean it's a pretty big weakness for alyza uh but he doesn't do it he doesn't play Rook H2 instead he plays Bishop C3 Bishop D2 inviting Knight C4 and then Bishop C3 got uh oh I don't know if you heard that but that that that sounded like pretty epic coming from upstairs um on top of getting food poisoning I have a pounding headache this like I'm in bad shape uh I really hope to recover because I'm here for the chess kid national festival I can't be out here recovering from food poisoning anyway uh that's a weakness that's a potential weakness and gkes is ready to attack it alira of of course uh trying to deal with his problems in a tactical way trying to get rid of these these pawns and uh he plays F4 and I mean he's just liquidating and let's not forget uh gash has to win right he's got to win so Queen takes H7 he grabs a Pawn Ali Resa takes and now this is the extra Pawn it's not really much uh there is a tactic here Rook takes G3 it looks like it works Rook takes G3 Queen F4 check but after King B1 actually white gets a very powerful attack with Knight C5 various stuff over here so it looks like you can just win the pawn back right away but you can't but it doesn't matter because Ali Resa just puts these Knights like right into gha's face Knight B5 and uh yeah gkes I think knowing he has to play for a win plays Knight B5 but the position is just losing Queen B6 now and black is completely winning black is going to win material and again he doesn't need to win with black but sometimes in chess when you have to win with uh a certain color uh and and and you you're deliberately taking a bunch of risk that side will just make the draw and you know he completely does not have to do this but he plays here trades everything plays B6 and basically says gesh you're not going to win this game and yeah players agree to a draw so Ali Resa fua gets fifth place gesh gets sixth Ali Resa secures a invitation uh for the next edition of this event now it is time for our third place match yesterday these guys played a banger of a game uh they played a game where at the very end leavon you know pulled some genius uh out of his you know what and um basically saved an end game down three pawns which is ridiculous I'm just taking us back to the opening here Levon plays an English so he plays like this C4 Knight C3 G3 which is generally the starting position of an English opening with the bishop coming to G2 is very fascinating uh that uh we have an English so C4 G3 Bishop G2 this is like just a pure English opening uh like it would be you know in any other situation in chess we have a trade and here we're going to have a totally different game in the previous two games we had massive explosion in the center of the board here we have a totally closed position so neither guy is like clashing open or doing anything instead uh White is relying on the queen side pressure with the queen on G2 now Knight C6 and here Levon right away plays B4 and clearly already as you can see from the evaluation on move s has a very very powerful initiative uh his pawns are moving directly into nock's Knights and norbe can't actually capture here because the pawn on B7 will fall which will symbolize uh and begin the complete Devastation of that position no here has to play a really ugly move it's really not a move you want to play Spence uh a lot of time ultimately decides to play it and yeah Rook B8 defends that pawn but now you can't castle that way which is horrendous it is really horrendous and from the opening obviously in this game Levon just wins it I mean he he won this opening hands down with this type of setup and you know apparently ner Beck blundered on the second move which is kind of insane that that's how chess 960 works like instead of D6 he should have castled and actually just in general in chess 960 the computer really likes opening up the queen and Rook before committing anything else but as you can see here it's very indecisive it just told me to play H5 I played it and now it's starting to reconsider so even the computer doesn't exactly know maybe white just has an inherent Advantage Knight B3 and now Levon just has to develop his pieces and he just goes for it he just plays C5 he's attacking Nock while no's King is still stranded in the center of the board uh he's going to have a very powerful initiative that he's going to try to open up it's just a very difficult position we have Pawn takes on C5 we have Knight C5 Knight takes B7 as a threat so black has to move as king it's as if black just invented a new chess 960 position by moving his rook and moving his King now he can't castle at all miserable Lavon just backs up he just backs up because the SE file is going to open with massive massive uh attacking possibilities take take E6 now castles because again you can you can commit your king this way but you would obviously rather have the Rook so you got to commit your king the other direction and you don't care about H4 none of this matters to you cuz there's no there's no attack your queen is actually doing a very nice job defending your king and now Rook A1 Rook A1 and the other Rook is coming to C1 which apparently by the way according to the engine wasn't even right apparently he should have played Bishop F4 and that's how he should have continued his attack but he puts both Rooks like this and I don't really know how nck is expected to defend this position considering he already moved this King so his King and Rook are completely stuck Pawn takes G3 Pawn takes G3 he activates the queen to try to create some problems but now levon's a pawn up Levon is a pawn up with all of the benefits of his position that he had previously Rook to h8 there's still no threat White's Queen is doing an excellent job protecting the king and attacking from a distance every piece Levon has is activated Knight Rook other rook and queen the queen is defending protect attack and most importantly eat snack and get food poisoning E5 Bishop ship slides back Black's position completely disintegrating and even from a distance M us covered noack backs up and I got to tell you from start to finish this game was all Levon look at that look at that just walking out confidently against all of this queen G1 Rook H1 Rook takes E4 sacrificing a rook what an absolutely beautiful move and the funniest thing is after he sacrifices the rook and attacks the black king the entire idea of this was to promote a queen but first go here that is that is pretty that is quite a way to end the game your opponent's going to take and you are going to end four pawns up with an absolutely devastating attack and Levon the deserved winner absolutely beautiful game from start to finish I mean he just played a very energetic like English style attack with Bishop G2 and and B4 and just what a game what a game came from Levon to get third place uh and this is vintage Levon I mean he he's really good at these like odd Dynamic creative positions and now it is time for the main event so again openings in these games have been confrontational in the center Levon played an English Magnus plays G4 so Magnus decides to open up his Queen and if you're ever playing chess 960 on the internet you will sometimes snipe one of your opponent's pawns like this uh believe it or not the best move here for black uh is to Castle Queens side there's no other move if you bring your knight out you run the risk of running into the same stuff that Nock ran into which is white is actually very powerful on this diagonal and there's even moves like D4 and you can't take because losing this Pawn is devastating it's really really bad so instead of that actually black should castle and probably uh Fabiano did not want to commit his King so quickly right like it's very rare you can you know Castle on the first move even in chess 960 but uh he plays C6 and the craziest thing about the move C6 it was literally given a a question mark o what is happening there we go it was literally given a question mark by the game analysis can you imagine you look at your own game analysis and it literally questions your first move it was given a question mark But the idea is very straightforward obviously right like he he just wants to stop Queen takes B7 he doesn't want to put his Knight out and he wants to play D5 and he doesn't want to Castle that quickly and then Magnus is like all right well I'm going to Castle you don't want to do it I'm going to Castle somebody's got to Castle and I've sort of been telling you throughout this recap already the computer in chess 960 really likes to open up Queen and rook and there we see it we see Magnus commit his King and then play G4 H4 which is which is very interesting so now he's going to try to expand on that side of the board um it's not a good idea to capture this Pawn because white will very quickly take as much space as possible take in advance so instead of that we have H6 Magnus takes some Center space and there's that plan in action by Fabiano so we have this D5 C6 very strong kind of uh complex the dark squares are potentially a little bit weak and these Knights are going to struggle to get out like the Knight can't get out here so it's going to have to get out this way which means this bishop might struggle a little bit to get out and Magna is kind of sensing already that his opponent is playing in a very in a very passive way uh plays this move E4 just trying to make Fabiano commit things defensively we we we've seen E4 quite a bit and we've seen everybody who played against the move E4 play E6 why black is not taking is because your king is still in the center right so like white can play Knight C3 and try to play for D5 which could be very dangerous and if white gets the queen out the attack could be potentially very very potent so instead of that we have castles Now by Fabiano so Fabiano after all of that finally decides to commit his King he could have committed it on the second move but Magnus definitely enjoys a comfortable Advantage early uh and in this game we have this we also had that in the game between Vincent and ding but in that game um the knights became a Target not in this game because there's no Knights out so A5 A4 isn't a thing so Magnus has sort of gotten uh a very very pleasant Edge out of the opening essentially securing everything that was possible for him to secure and now Fabiano plays this move E6 and this position is very uncomfortable he has a lot of Pawns on light squares his light squared Bishop is obviously quite cramped but it's a kind of position where he's like passive and he solid and Magnus is going to have to walk him down he's going to have to take the fight to him and Magnus says okay Bishop D2 F4 look at that look at that The Fabulous Five Pawns just all targeting something in the black position and he's also as always gambiing a pawn Magnus loves giving away Pawns in chess 960 this is a free Pawn I think magnus's idea if his opponent did this was to go here and play F5 and just try to team up his pawns together and suffocate the black position uh and uh yeah for good reason I mean this is a very very tough position now for black now Fabiano plays Knight D7 so again not touching anything and committing nothing yet and now Magnus makes a decision what does he do which Pawn will he push forward which Pawn will he capture with will he capture at all uh this is a very sophisticated transformational technique here that Magnus uh un corks on Fabiano first he takes on D5 now both moves have drawbacks the Knight taking has no Central Pawn presence so if you take with a knight white in the future can play like C4 you take with this Pawn you destabilize your king a little bit but if you take with this Pawn you give white a Target on the E file which is also terrible so you got to go like this and now very straightforward you take on G5 like this and then you push and the idea is you created an outside pass Pawn so by doing this transformation you have a protected outside pass Pawn outside meaning on the edge of the board only the queen is preventing it and now that pawn is going to be a major problem for black to deal with in many in many positions not just in the end game but also in all middle game positions so Magnus is just sort of slicing and dicing through the black defenses black is passive and he sort of sitting back and allowing the game to come to him but because magnus's Advantage is so strong uh he's able to kind of transform the position and now the game takes this type of nature Bishop D3 developing the bishop I mean this move is pretty self-explanatory uh black plays Queen H6 safeguarding the pawn and also maybe preparing to slide The Rook out of the way uh you definitely did not want to you know leave this Pawn to potentially make it all the way down so you block the pawn Rook F1 winning a little bit of uh file control rook f8 and now Magnus plays Queen G1 what what is the point of Queen G1 I I don't know maybe he wants to go here uh Fabiano here can still consider playing energetically and maybe the idea was basically to pressure this Pawn Fabiano has to break out at some point he's got to try to be aggressive at some point if he just sits back as you can tell from his Bishops and his Knights he's very passive so Queen G1 Bishop C6 again maybe F5 would have been the way to go very complicated position however so Fabby brings his Bishops out and this is a really sophisticated idea from Magnus who takes a moment here and goes which of my pieces is the worst which is tough to say because they're all honestly doing a pretty good job and he decides it's the dark sored bishop and what he wants to do is put it here where it will have very very strong pressure on the diagonal potentially with the queen as well and to bring the bishop here he trades this bishop because that Bishop is Black's better Bishop so we have take take and now black is left with a light squared bishop and a bunch of Pawns on light squares and knights that like are scrambling to become relevant so now if  plays this nice idea Knight C4 just trying to do something you know you can take this with white it does open up the bishop but it's the move recommended by the engine and then you can reroute the Knight to the center Magnus plays Rook e one because that Rook was not controlling a whole lot Knight Here and Now F5 is played and Fabiano uh has the best position that he's had in the entire game so Fab's about to begin a comeback the pawn on E6 is very weak it's a backwards pawn pawn whose neighbors Advance forward and the square in front of it is completely logged down and um Magnus got to be very careful because if he takes there's moves like G4 check and all of a sudden that pawn is feeling a little bit loose F five what is Magnus going to do well infiltrates targeting this Pawn Fabiano plays Knight E4 what a move secured by both of his pawns and already here with white you could go wrong uh if you take with a knight and you allow me to take like this and now I've got targets it's a very very dangerous position to allow me to have but here Magnus plays his most clutch move of the game which is a move that doesn't even look like it makes any sense the entire game has been fought in this this rectangle but when Fabiano plops his Knight into the center of the board Magnus realizes he doesn't actually have a threat and I can play A4 and the idea of A4 is that in the future if we trade here there's Knight B5 and then there's also B4 and B5 ideas so the B5 Square Magnus anticipates for the transformation of the position A4 is a crazy move to play you know black can play A6 and wait but then I would take then I would open up the position uh and then I would control a lot of important queenside squares A4 is a deep move I mean it is a highlevel move and Fabiano decides he is going to get rid of one of these Knights because they're too annoying but he takes the wrong one and as you can tell from the evaluation bar Fabby decided he was going to be up a pawn and that would be good enough to secure counterplay with the the G pawn and queen takes H5 but it's not good enough and now Magnus trades the Rooks sacrifices the queen Forks picks up the queen back and when it's all said and done material is equal but this Pawn is too strong and the pawn goes and Magnus can Chuck this Pawn completely for a brief moment in time he's down a pawn in a rook end game but he's completely winning because of Rook E5 he's actually going to win both of these pawns play H7 and just go here and uh he takes plays Rook G6 trades the Bishops and this is a completely winning Rook end game because his Pawn is too strong it's going to make it to the AG s Square black Rook will either have to be very passive or fight from behind but it doesn't really make a difference white can play Rook G7 H7 and start marching the king Black's pawns are completely immobile none of them can move Black's King is going to get stranded here behind the pawns black will have to lose a pawn to activate his King and it's just not good enough Rook F1 King D1 Magnus gets the pawn to H7 so now the black Rook has to stay exactly where it is King E1 and uh this is chucking these pawns because you're just going to walk the king to the G1 Square Fabiano like I said SA ricing material to activate his King but it's just not good enough Rook C7 everything is held together the white king is going to walk over here Kick Out The Rook back and walk up the board black can't do anything The Rook is defending absolutely everything King E3 King G1 Rook H6 Magnus Begins the march of the king and Fabiano caruana resigns in this position because there is absolutely nothing he can do he can try to stop the king but then I will simply play I mean I can even play B5 Rook C6 but I'll play something like Rook here Rook here and you know again I I can even walk my king that way it doesn't even matter there is nothing to be done and Magnus Carlson is the champion of the freestyle goat chess challenge uh the inaugural event the event that he basically was responsible for organizing and bringing together and uh this I suppose you can call his 18th world championship title technically this was not the world championship but hopefully the next Edition has hiar who's the reigning defending world champion at this format of Fisher random uh and also Wesley so who's a beast in Fisher random chess but for now it's Magnus Carlson then it's Fabiano Carana leavon aronia no abdor Ali reru in fifth gukesh in sixth Vincent kimer in seventh and dingly ren uh in the eighth place spot and that's all Magnus can't stop winning and it's for good reason I'm going to go lay in bed because I'm not feeling well uh I appreciate you all very much for watching the event along with me tomorrow we'll get back to regularly scheduled programming get out of here
