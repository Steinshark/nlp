today i thought we'd talk about uh 
internet standards and in particularly   uh the uh request for comments the famous rfs 
yes he referred here in there yeah so they   started out exactly what they said on the tin 
as a request for comments so the very first one   rfc number one was by uh steve crocker who was 
one of the very early movers in uh the internet   at ucla and he published that on the 7th of april 
1969 as rfc one and it really was a request for   comments it was like uh we're going to try 
doing these things um what do you think guys   exactly that and so he sent it around 
to a few people saying here's a request   for comments have you got any comments 
on on this and then they kind of stuck you know pretty much all the internet 
standards well actually all the internet   standards are now got rfcs behind them 
so uh tcp and ip they're rfc 793 and 791   and there's a couple of other ones around 
there they grew fairly slowly because   there weren't very many standards to publish in 
the early days and but they they're coming quite   aware now so how does it work when one of these 
is published how do the comments come in that   have been requested if right well i don't know how 
they worked originally in back in the early days   but nowadays you you publish an rfc draft and 
you say here's a draft and uh this is this is   what i want to uh standardize or um some of them 
are informational some of them are standards like   tcpip or rfc822 i spent a lot of time with that's 
the internet mail standard and 821 which is smtp   so some of them are just like that that they're 
they define as standard some of them are sort of   these are best practices or this is kind of 
what we got there's quite a number of them   and i have to say i've contributed to this list 
that are just um humorous and often posted on   the first of april or something like that so 
i've actually got three with my name as author   two of them are pretty obscure now they 
were early days stuff to do with x25 and tcp   and another one to do with network time over 
x25 which nobody does anymore but perhaps my   most famous one is rfc 1606 which was an april 
the first one there's a little bit of history   behind it so at the time um we were running 
out of ip addresses something that we're still   doing to this very day and this was back in 1990 
something or other this was um and the there's   this big crunch coming up that we're going to run 
out of ip addresses any time now it's 1994 we're   still not um we're going to happen there's lots of 
reasons behind that and they were discussing ipv6   which is you know this new version of uh internet 
protocol that hasn't exactly taken well by storm   but it's sort of gradually encroaching and there's 
a lot of discussions i think there are about six   proposals at the time that were internet drafts 
and would become rfcs and uh they'd all got   various suggestions about it so um you probably 
know ipv version 4 has a 32-bit addressing so   that means there's 4 billion possible places that 
you can address and that seems a bit limited you   know given us what eight or nine billion people on 
the planet if you want to give them each internet   address you can't actually do it but we get around 
that with nuts and things like that so at the   time we were discussing what the ipv6 addressing 
should be and there were various proposals there's   64 bits i think there's 60 bit there's various 
other things usually it was in powers of two   because they fit into words quite easily and 
there were one or two that were looking at 128 bit   things and at the time i wrote a short article and 
which wasn't actually published anywhere i just   posted it on the newsletter i think on 
one of the groups tcp discussions and uh   instead of saying no no this is silly we 
should we should think think ahead and uh   let's not go crazy let's let's fix this once 
and for all that was sort of my argument lots   of other people were arguing the same thing so i 
thought i could write a sort of paper saying no we   should go for 128 bits because um you know that's 
going to be far more addresses than we ever need   because the original arpanet started 
out with i think uh 256 addresses   they thought that would be plenty that 
would be all the machines you'd ever need   and then they realized it wasn't and 
then they went for 32 bits and said well   you know four billion addresses that's 
going to be more than we'll ever need   and then we came to e6 and they said well 
you know 64 bits that's going to be more   than we'll ever need and so i wrote 
a a rather spoof paper which i called   the demise of ipv version 9 originally but it 
got uh published as a historical perspective   on the usage of ipv9 and it was supposed to be a 
sort of a 22nd century look back at why ipv9 was   having to be retired because it didn't have a big 
enough address space so i published this out as   a sort of tug-in-cheek article and said you know 
the serious point about it was you know let's not   make another mistake and uh go with just a small 
address space what's v6 is it 64. it's 128 bits   so there should be plenty to go around for that 
so that that was a good thing anyway but anyway   i published this out on the network i think it 
was sort of february or march time about about   an hour i guess um just as a humorous thing and 
i published a number of similar tongue-in-cheek   articles that uh nobody took seriously luckily 
but this one was picked up by john postell who's   the rfc editor at the time a really lovely guy 
who edited all the rfcs up until his unfortunate   and timely demise i only met him once he lived on 
the west coast of america uh anyway he he sent me   a quick email in response to this and said 
uh i found it quite amusing or something um   should we could we just publish an rfc i said oh 
yeah yeah i guess you could what do i need to do   to do that i said it's all done taken care of 
and julie on the first of uh uh april it came   out as this ipv9 now the odd thing about it is 
that when people are looking for serious systems   like universities go out for tender to uh for a 
networking thing they often sort of go through all   the rfcs and say um well which ones to do with tcp 
which wanted to do with ip we'll make a tick list   and say they should adhere to all these standards 
and they often come across mine and say oh i p   version oh yeah yeah we should definitely adhere 
to that standard and so i've had many queries over   the years since it was published saying uh can 
i get an implementation of this iv version nine   say you know well have you actually read the rfc 
because it's probably not something you want to   uh deal with so some unwitting uh like uh system 
implementer is has been told your uh proposal must   adhere to all these standards and yeah all these 
have got ip and then title so you should adhere   to them all you know we all know rfc are standards 
but there's actually about 30 or 40 humorous rfcs   that you should not uh adhere to i mean there's 
a one that predates mine rfc 1149 which is a   transmission of ip datagrams over avian carriers 
so this is how to transmit tcp over pigeons   and there has been actually an implementation of 
that where you print out the packet you attach it   to the foot of a pigeon you send it off you 
catch it in the loft you then type back in now if if we go back to one of your recent 
ones about pings and trace routes they actually   did a ping thing with this the ping time was 
several hours or whatever i'm going to say yeah   if you were lucky yeah that one has also been 
cited in uh you know proposals saying we should   appear to all the rfcs and uh 1149 seems to be 
to do ip2 so let's get that i'd like to see that   implemented like wide scale it'd be like harry 
potter or something i think there's been an update   to it to actually improve the performance of it 
what people do with their spare time is quite   quite weird what do you have to do to make an 
rf6 unless you're doing one of these humorous   ones usually you form a group and you get together 
particularly if it's something that's crucial like   internet mail or tcp ip or ipv6 you know ipv6 they 
deliberated about for several years before they uh   came up with they picked the one version that 
they were going to go with and went for so   usually you form a group you form a working group 
you publish drafts people comment on the drafts   you revise the drafts people comment on those they 
argue about them they add features a bit like any   other standardization where does the numbering 
come from though is there like a is there someone   that hands out a number for you yeah normally 
you just get the next number in the sequence so   now a few of them you do get special numbers so 
when they revised rfc 822 which is internet mail   standard it was coming they were in the 2000s at 
the time and they waited to 2822 so it got 2822   i think it's being revised again or they're 
always tinkering adding little bits on to   them sometimes they replace the entire 
standard and they say it's now being   deprecated and it's been replaced by this one so 
in that case you know rfc 822 was replaced with   2822 which was nice and memorable and sounds like 
it's crying out for a block train solution oh yeah   yes could could well be i don't know that 
probably somebody has considered that who knows   now what if there was a secret 
mathematical relationship between   p and q would that change anything what if 
p was actually equal to some multiple of q   like this now with different time to lives you 
can find out every hob on your journey very neat
