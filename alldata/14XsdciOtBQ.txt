hello everyone and welcome many argue the V10 era of Formula 1 was the era of the best engines and when I started digging into it surprisingly these engines are still insanely impressive 20 years later even compared against modern standards now before we go off the deep end reminiscing over 20,000 RPM and talking about how they're the greatest engines of all time let's lower expectations and to do so we're going to use the Ferrari engine from 2004 so back into 2004 the Ferrari engine was a 3 l naturally aspirated V10 engine making as much as 920 horsepower at 19,000 RPM okay but how much torque was it making well it's a simple equation to find out horsepower time 5252 ided RPM and we can find out that it is making just 254 pound feet of torque which okay we don't have any context let's provide a little context a Chevy Spark EV one of the dorkiest electric cars of all time 400 lb feet of torque all right but that's an electric car right not really fair comparison how about a Honda Accord simple old sedan with a 2 L turbo engine 273 lb feet of torque so more than you know this incredible engine that we all hail from you know the early 2000s of being this engineering Marvel only 254 lb feet of torque well realistically no production car engine of all time can match the performance of what this engine was capable of okay so why share these silly facts about torque well it helps illustrate and show that power is truly what matters and that torque without context is really a meaningless thing to kind of compare so I think we can all agree you know a Ferrari F1 car is going to be faster uh than a Honda Accord and yet you can show that oh you know this has more torque right so it's going to be quicker not torque doesn't really matter power is the important thing another thing slightly disingenuous comparison because for the Ferrari engine we're looking at torque at Peak horsepower not its peak torque though the number will probably only be slightly higher and it will occur at probably a lower RPM not a huge difference but let's do an Apples to Apples comparison using one of the most advanced naturally aspirated engines arguably the most advanced currently sold today uh in a production car which is the 4 L boxer 6cylinder in the Porsche GT3 RS it is producing 518 horsepower at 8500 RPM again we do that same math to find what is its torque at its peak horsepower and that ends up being about 320 lb Feet Again more than that Ferrari engine and also if you want to know you know what is the comparison of that at Peak horsepower versus Peak torque it's only a slight difference so again I don't feel that uncomfortable sharing this number even though that is not the true Peak torque of the engine but again Apples to Apples comparison with the Porsche the Porsche does have more torque though it is a larger engine so in order to fairly compare the two engines we need to talk about torque per liter now while the adults at the adult table with their fancy adult clothing and whatever uh you know they got calculators they're nerdy Engineers they're talking break mean effective pressure at the kids table we don't need that nonsense we're just trying to understand the basics so we are talking torque per liter effectively the same thing way easier to understand if you really want to understand map I've got a separate video covering all the details on it so torque per liter what is it well think about having a 1 lit engine if you're to take that Ferrari engine and turn it into just one liter if you take that Porsche engine and turn it into just one liter how much torque would that have torque per liter of that engine so for the Porsche that number is about 80 lb feet per liter for the Ferrari F1 engine it's about 85 lb feet per liter and this isn't even the best Formula 1 engine of that era there are some making as high as 1,000 h power even Ferrari had engines in 2005 that were slightly more powerful at the same RPM so not even the best versus arguably today's best engine for sale and you might say well Jason what about the Aston Martin Valkyrie with its insane engine you know super high revving or the Gordon Murray t50 with its insane engine both of these have lower torque per liter lower brightly effective pressure than the Porsche engine so you know these multi-million doll cars cannot keep up with the techn ology that Porsche employs within their engine so perhaps the Porsche for doing it for much less money now production cars do have some big factors working against them two of the major ones being emissions for example with the Porsche you have to have this more restrictive exhaust so of course that means less power and then longevity right the Porsche has to last you know 100,000 Mi 200,000 mil versus this Ferrari F1 engine you know needs to only last a racer to so not an insane life to it versus the Porsche you have to be much more conservative with your tuning because you need that thing to last a really long amount of time even still it is pretty insane that an engine from 20 years ago cannot be beat by today's best technology in production cars okay so what about horsepower per liter and usually this really isn't that fair of a comparison unless we're just talking about two naturally aspirated engines in the case of the Porsche GT3 we have about 130 horsepower per liter versus the Ferrari F1 engine over 300 horsepower per liter as absolutely absurd so you can even compare this to today's best turbo engines and they get nowhere near it so if you look at the kig seg tiny friendly giant engine when it's running on gasoline it's making 250 horsepower per liter 500 horsepower out of a little 2 L engine and if you cheat a little bit you run on ethanol well then you're getting 300 horsepower per liter but even still it can't match it and again this isn't the best naturally aspirated engine out there so the Ferrari F1 engine doing better than today's best production car using a ton of boost like it's insane how much power per liter it is making nothing today can beat a 20-year-old naturally aspirated engine in Horsepower per liter absolutely absurd all right so how is that possible now I think the easiest way to understand how an engine is making so much power is to look at how much air is actually going through that engine and measure that air so in other words what we're going to do is we're going to look at the swept volume of the Piston over the course of a minute and see how much air can we pull in within that minute how much air is going through that engine because with that amount of air you burn a certain amount of fuel you make a certain amount of power now in order to understand how much air goes through that engine we take our displacement we multiply that by our RPM and then we're going to divide that by two because this is a fourstroke engine so that means we only have one intake stroke for every four strokes in other words only one intake for every 2 RPM okay so for the Porsche we've got a 4 L engine we're multiplying that by 8500 RPM and that divided by two means we have 17,000 L per minute of air going through this engine for the Ferrari F1 engine we have 28,500 L of air going through this engine per minute so 68% more air than the Porsche and it's making 78% more horsepower so you can see with all that additional air it is able to make more power now you can actually get more air than what I've shown and if you look at the F1 regulations they provide a clue as to how even though at the time supercharging was prohibited but listen to the definition of supercharging increasing the weight of the charge of the fuel air mixture in the combustion chamber over the weight induced by normal atmospheric pressure Ram effect and dynamic effects in the intake and or exhaust system by any means whatsoever so you can see there's a bit of an exception there and as an example of how you can put this to work Sam Collins in race car engineering wrote at the end of the straight at the Shanghai circuit where the car is traveling at close to 330 km hour with DRS open the air pressure hitting the air filter will be close to 1,70 MB normal ambient air pressure is around 1,20 MB this means the engine produces around 5% more power equivalent to 40 brake horsep power than at walking speed now Porsche is also using intake tricks to raise the pressure inside the cylinders above what is available from the atmosphere but what does Ferrari's engine do differently to rev so high now 10 years ago when I was a real engineer I carried around with me this little pocket ruler and our calibration Engineers ensured its accuracy as of March 2014 so I use this pocket ruler to give you an accurate drawing to scale of what the bore and Stroke of the GT3 Engine versus the Ferrari Formula 1 engine look like so this is looking inside our cylinder basically and seeing how much does that piston move within the cylinder as you can see in the GT3 81.5 mm more than double that of the Ferrari F1 engine so the Ferrari F1 engine look at that the Piston's only moving this tiny little distance back and forth so despite the fact that it's revving extremely high the distance that piston travels per RPM is fairly low so the old overall distance these Pistons travel is actually very similar what does that mean well it means you have similar piston speeds so you can do the math and calculate it for the Porsche GT3 that number the average piston speed is 24.5 m/s and for the Ferrari 25.2 m/s so nearly identical even though this is revving way way faster so that's showing the advantage of using a short stroke now an underappreciated art and science of these old school Formula 1 engines is just the amount of research and knowledge that has to go into the materials and design of every single part ensuring that you don't run into their natural frequencies and just destroy this engine so the frequency at which these different objects want to vibrate out of control and then just cause catastrophic failure with your engines so a great example of this and a simple one to understand are the springs that are used so F1 they use pneumatic valves using air pressure rather than mechanical spring so if you look in the Porsche engine you'd see a mechanical spring so you have that little finger follower your cam shaft presses down on the valve and a mechanical spring forces that valve back up when the portion of the cam lobe isn't directly acting on it so it's simple it's reliable it works uh but up at a certain RPM you start to lose control of that spring and it becomes unpredictable you have valve float you no longer control the position of that valve that's obviously a terrible thing to do if a piston hits it the Piston wins and you're not going to have great air flow so what do they do in Formula 1 well they use air pressure so you use air pressure so that you always have that return spring you don't have to worry about that natural frequency that vibration of the spring and losing its control and you can have control up to these crazy engine speeds like 20,000 RPM it's complicated you have leaks it's not going to have a long life but in Formula 1 it's like who cares right the engine only has to last a few hours at a time and then you can refill uh you know that air pressure in there and not worry about it so it's not that big of a deal in a racing environment that it's not you know this longevity Focus isn't there all right so let's move on to where we are today so in the pursuit of ensuring that Formula 1 is relevant to today's road cars we now have 1.6 L 90° V6 engines they are turbocharged they are hybrid uh but they have a very rigid rule set you've got 80 mm boore you've got four valve everyone has to do all of that right you don't really have much leeway and where you can change these different parameters they all must be exactly that uh another thing you know just looking at some of the valve train components you can't have variable valve timing you can't have variable valve lift you can't use variable geometry turbochargers so if you look at the rules everything basically ensures that you have to optimize this engine for one RPM and that happens to be around 10,500 about 11,000 RPM where you can't use any more fuel beyond that point so it really becomes pointless to do so so they all become optimized for the single RPM all using you know kind of these archaic rules that really today's production cars are not bound by and as a result it means these engines are not at all relevant to what is on the road but regardless they are very impressive in how much power they put out so a 1.6 L in Formula 1 today making about 850 horsepower and other words 530 horsepower per liter of course it is turbocharged but a much higher number uh than the old days of Formula 1 and I did kind of Lie to y'all when I said that there's nothing in production today uh that can beat that Ferrari F1 car if you look at the amg1 which is a Formula 1 derived engine used in a production car okay it has 350 horsepower per liter for the combustion engine portion of that vehicle so it can be you know a Formula 1 engine from 20 years ago is it actually a production car I don't know did I lie to y'all maybe so my bad now to me one of the most important relevant to Road car stories to come out of Formula 1 is the fact that they want to use 100% sustain aable fuels by 2026 and so to me it's like okay well then why do we need this rigid irrelevant 1.6 L V6 if the fuel is going to be sustainable anyway so imagine you know a screaming V10 going down the main straight and then being like hey that's Net Zero carbon emissions that's actually an incredible statement that you can make while still using a piece of technology that's kind of old school but also you can make it more modern and you can make it really cool to me that seems like a way sweeter way to go then using these tiny little turbo engines uh that kind of just go like man you can't really you know they're just not as exciting okay now I'm going to answer my own question because you know why not so why shouldn't we do this well if you look at the trend in Formula 1 back in the old days you could refuel you can use as much fuel as you want 2013 they're down to 160 kg of fuel 2020 100 kg of fuel and by 2026 they're targeting around 70 kilg of fuel so you can see the trend right use less fuel now why would that be the trend uh if we're going towards sustainable fuels so here's a quote from the European Journal combustion engines in 2030 the cost of energy needed to power a car with an SI engine and E fuel will be nearly four times higher than in the case of an electric vehicle so if synthetic fuels are going to be relevant whatsoever we need to make sure that combustion engines are as efficient as is possible to ensure that the pricing of synthetic fuels makes absolutely any sense to actually use and so the goal of reducing fuel consumption to complete the same task is a worthy goal in demonstrating this technology but it's like you know racing is always kind of irrelevant in terms of road cars uh there's so many series out there that you know don't try at all to have any relevancy with road cars and it's like Formula E already exists if you want to push electric cars and show what technology can do so it's like what are we showcasing here with Formula 1 like plug-in hybrids like it's a it's a strange space that it's in so it's like I don't know maybe use tan and synthetic fuel but it's a difficult position uh I get if you enjoyed this there are two really cool videos I'd recommend checking out the First on how the tiny little 1.6 L power units used in Formula 1 today are capable of making 1,000 horsepower and then the second one on how these power units are going to change for 2026 so the engines are going to be making significantly less power but the power unit overall still making 1,000 horsepower any questions or comments feel free to leave those below thanks for watching
