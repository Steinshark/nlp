- I am going to spend the next 24 hours in this house made 100% of ice. It's gonna be cold because it's ice. Ice, ice. Even the toilet is made of ice. Oh my goodness, this seat is so cold. This is gonna be hard, I don't even have anywhere to sit. Close the door. This ice door weighs 600 pounds. And there we go, the 24 hours begins now. - I noticed when we were talking to Jimmy, the ice seemed the little see through. I wanna test something out. - [Karl] Oh my God. - [Chris] Hey Jim Jim, can you see that? Oh, my butt's wet, ah. - [Jimmy] Gentlemen, come here. Do you know why I called this meeting? - No, we never do. - If I survive all 24 hours in this ice, you guys have to cover
yourself in syrup and feathers and stand on the side of the road. But if I get out, I have to cover myself
in syrup and feathers and stand on the side of the road. - Can we just not. - If you want to join my team, come on in. - No. - [Chris] No. - I bought a lot of syrup
and it's not going on me. That's all, you can go. - We have to get him out. - I'm not doing the punishment, just to be clear, I'm not
gonna do the punishment. Jimmy, you're getting
out, you're going down. It's warm in here. - Jimmy, it's so warm in
here, I bet you're cold. - [Jimmy] I am very cold. - We're helping him too much by talking, the more he talks, the warmer he gets. I say we stuff it with a tree. Putting Jimmy in time out. - [Jimmy] Is this so I can't see you guys? - [Karl] Yes. - [Jimmy] Thank you for putting a tree on top of my front door. - I think it'll be nice for you. (audience laughing) - [Jimmy] My hands are turning
super red from the cold. Tariq is that you? - [Tariq] Yeah, what's up dude? - [Jimmy] Where are the boys? - [Tariq] They want to get some food. - [Jimmy] We just started. - [Tariq] They're always hungry, okay? - [Jimmy] Ooh, I see you
got some gloves there Tariq. - [Tariq] Yeah, they're
warm, what do you want? - [Jimmy] I think it's
pretty obvious what I want. - [Tariq] All right, you
didn't get 'em from me. - [Jimmy] Hey, I know I
can always count on you. Thank you for your gloves. Hey, hey, I'll give you
10 grand if you help me. - [Tariq] Oh easy, yes. - I have a spy now and
the boys have no idea. Shh. (mellow music) It is really cold in here. This was not a good idea. Comment down below how much you think I've spent on this video. And at the end of the video,
I'll tell you what I've spent. The results may shock you. - Dude, Jimmy, there's no chance Jimmy's gonna last this whole time. It's practically snowing in here. - Nah, that's just me man, sorry. - What are you feeding me for lunch? - [Karl] There's so much
ice you can eat man. You can just lick the walls. - [Jimmy] You see this
statue of Chandler pooping? - [Karl] Yeah. Feed me within the next
hour or his head's gone. - [Chandler] Screw that guy. Wow. - Chandler, this is your head. - [Chandler] Hey buddy. - [Jimmy] You've been mean to me. - [Chandler] Wow. - You know what would be cool? Pancakes with syrup, 'cause you guys are gonna
be covered in syrup. - [Chris] Gotcha, okay,
pancakes with syrup. - That was a joke, I don't actually want pancakes with syrup. - You're getting pancakes in syrup. Hey also Jimmy, I noticed
you're getting cold, so we bought you a jacket. There you go. - For my pinky? - Your played yourself. It's no longer cold. - It still looks cold,
you're surrounded by ice. - It is freezing, but at least now my
butt's not wet (chuckles). Thank you for the jacket (indistinct). - [Voiceover] Do you like pancakes? - Oh, Jim jam. Here are your pancakes
and plenty of syrup. - Oh, that's good. (mellow music) - [Voiceover] Plenty of syrup. - Oh, this is for me. - [Chris] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoa. - This one's not covered in syrup. - Hey, you forgot your fork. (Jimmy laughing) - [Chris] Shovel it into your mouth. Yeah. (upbeat music) Ayy, ayy, you're cold. We're hot. - I'm not gonna give them the
satisfaction of responding. Just like in solitary, if I ignore 'em long
enough they just get bored. I've noticed they can only be really stupid for about 10 minutes, and then they get tired of it. (upbeat music) I have no idea how long I've been in here, but the cold is definitely
starting to get to me. I just feel cold, I don't know how else to put it. This is definitely one of the
harder challenges I've done. Goodness. My snot keeps dripping into my mouth. - Disgusting. - Why do I do these things? Can you get me something spicy? I wanna see if that heats me up. - [Karl] Okay. - I don't know if that's how it works, but it's worth the try. (upbeat music) If you join me now you
don't have to get punished, but after this point you're done. - There's no chance. - I'm not gonna reveal anything, but say we had a good
idea for some content and everybody thinks it's funny
but it's a little expensive, but we don't wanna spoil it. Can we get an approval? - How much does it cost? - Under 10 grand. - Ah, why not? - All good. - All right. - Yeah, woo. - Sitting down time lapse. (upbeat music) This is a toilet made 100% out of ice, and I kind of have to pee. You know where I'm going with this, I'll show you the results. (upbeat music) To be honest, it didn't really melt
like I thought it would. Who would've thought an ice
toilet would work so well? I'm sorry for showing you this, I'm bored. By this point, it was
really starting to set in how hard the rest of
the challenge would be. I was frigid and there was no
one around to keep me company, it was brutal. - [Karl] Jimmy, guess what? - [Chris] You're halfway through, yay. What you did all day, you just have to do that again. - [Karl] But now without sleep. - I am incredibly freezing
and I don't feel like moving. So the next 15 seconds of the video you two have freedom to
do whatever you want. - Jimmy told us we can use 15 seconds for whatever we wanted. He gave away both Chris' and my car, so we decided to give his away. We gave it to the audio guy
that you're seeing right now, look at him so excited. And that's our 15 seconds. (upbeat music) - Update, it's so cold I can't even hold my own camera anymore. Tariq is now holding my camera for me, and Brady is filming Tariq filming me. And Tyler is filming Brady
filming Tariq filming me. And no one was actually filming me when I said that last line, lovely. I know it's hard to tell but it was extremely late at this point. And this was literally the coldest I've ever been in my entire life. I was miserable. Remember that question
I asked you earlier? Well, the answer is this video cost me around $300,000 to make. For the price it took
to build this ice house, I could have bought a real house. I really hope you enjoy my suffering, it was expensive. - [Karl] I hope it's gonna fall forward, I hope it's gonna fall towards us. Oh, maybe just one, maybe one. - I see you have sledgehammers? - [Chris] Yeah. (group groaning in disgust) - It smells like pee. - It does smell like pee in here. All right boys, thank you for coming. - [Karl] By tomorrow we're
gonna have a flame thrower, goodbye. - [Chris] Yeah, we're
gonna get a flame thrower. - Goodnight. - [Jimmy] Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jimmy. - 44, 45, 46, 47, 48. If you're wondering why
I'm counting out loud, I don't know. Sometimes when you're suffering you do weird things to pass the time. Fun story, I have to pee, but
Chris destroyed my toilet. And I don't know about you guys, but it's currently 4:00 a.m.
which means I have to pee pee. I got that 4:00 a.m. pee in me right now, and if I don't get this out
soon I'm gonna pee my pants. My options are pee on broken PewDiePie, headless Chandler, or the bed. PewDiePie it is. - I am disgusted by this content. - I was in so much pain at this point that I had to have a medic come by and check my temperature every 30 minutes to make sure something
bad didn't happen to me. Luckily, my spy came
through with a blanket and some chicken nuggets. - Hey, good morning.
- Hey. - We just woke up and we overslept, so there's only two hours
left in the challenge. Okay, let's go get Jimmy out. You catch any Zs? - A little bit, yeah. Not gonna lie, whoever
gave me this blanket really helped me pull through. - [Chandler] We're gonna try
and melt a hold in Jimmy's ice. - [Jimmy] What? - [Chandler] Oh Jimmy. - [Jimmy] I just want you to know 68 more minutes until I get out. - We're gonna break through. - [Jimmy] Why, what's the point? - Hey, what's the point? Looks like this is the point right here. - Are you sure about that? - And you still not getting out? - [Jimmy] Nope. - I don't know what else to do. - I have a proposition, let's see how much Tyler likes you guys. - Ooh. - I already know he hates us. - Tyler, I will play you in a
game of rock, paper scissors. And if you win one of these three boys doesn't have to get syruped. But if you lose you have to join them. - Yes, I'll do it right now actually. - We're doing one and done, I'm going going scissors which
means you're gonna go rock. Which means I'm gonna go paper, which means you're gonna go scissors, which means I'm gonna go rock. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, paper, scissor, shoot. (group yelling) - [Tyler] Let's go. - I still have to do
the challenge for sure. - All or nothing? I'll just take everyone. - I'm down to do double or nothing. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. (Tyler grunting) All right, well, now Chandler
has to get feathered again. - Wait, I do too? - It was everybody double or nothing? - Yes. - Oh, I didn't know that. - That's what nothing means. - All right, I got what I wanted, now four people get syruped and feathered. Now that we established that
I'm going back to my hole. - We're in the final stretch, it's definitely been
probably the hardest thing I've ever done in my entire life. Minus maybe counting to
100,000, that was pretty hard. These last few hours
were the hardest by far. I'm so close to being done, but every part of my body
wants to get out now. Is that a bathtub? - [Karl] A hot tub, get in the hot tub. - [Jimmy] Shut up. - [Karl] Get in the hot tub. - Argh. Are you guys about to get in it? - [Karl] Yeah. - Oh, that does sound nice. - [Cameraman] It looks really steamy. - It does, I'm getting jealous. I hate it in here. (upbeat music) I was just informed I have
under 10 minutes left. And to celebrate, Karl I think we should hit
them with the yeehaw on three. One, two, three. - Yee. - I didn't think you would do it, I'm gonna do mine delay. Yeehaw. - Yeehaw.
- Thank you. Is it 10:00 a.m. yet? - Yeah. - Has it been 24 hours yet? - [Karl] Yes, yes. - It is officially. - Oh, is it? - Been 24 hours? - [Jimmy] It's 10:00 a.m? - [Chris] It's 10:00 a.m. - [Jimmy] Did he change his phone? Let me see yours. - [Cameraman] He did buy a new phone. - [Karl] Why are you so skeptical? Boo. - I survived 24 hours in this-- - Hand warmers. - Stupid building. Let's go become birds. And we're now on the side of the road with real people driving by. - Are you ready? - Oh no. Oh. - [Karl] It's thick. - To be fair, sitting in
that ice chamber for 24 hours was a lot worse than this. All right, now you gotta feather up. - Is this what you guys wanted to watch? - [Jimmy] Let's see what people think. - Look at the chicken. - We're chickens here. - Now my friends are
chickens the video's over. Subscribe, see you in the next one. ♪ Mr Beast 6000 ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ Mr Beast 6000, yeah you know his name ♪ ♪ He changed it once or twice,
