today we're talking about an unbelievably stupid story of Charity that really shows the brain rot of crypto Bros this man's quest to Simply donate money is going to lead him to space but before it does I have to say normally I am against scrutinizing charity I think all charity you know however you give wherever you give however much you give it's great but occasionally the motivations are so gross the methods so outrageous that it's worth making an exception and that's what we're doing today today we're talking about this man Eric finman and we're talking about his quest to save a school in Africa with cryptocurrency but to understand the full lore we have to start with who Eric is actually I'll let him introduce who he is I just want to start by saying I love being me wait wait Eric no no it we want to know who you are I love being myself it's a pretty sweet deal no no not who do you love who are you yeah I I really love being myself it's such a joy no Eric tell me what you do hi I'm Eric fine I'm the world's youngest Bitcoin millionaire I made it in Silicon Valley and I've accomplished a lot in my life already but now I'm leaving Big Tech to fight for free speech okay those are two clips of Eric from like seven years ago and then from just a year ago and as you can see he hasn't changed that much in that time he still loves himself quite a bit but in 2021 he made waves launching the freedom phone which is the ad you just saw and which got a ton of media attention but it was pretty much a commercial flop after the freedom phones core promise of privacy failed inspection and the chip set inside of it this isn't the product of someone who actually cares about privacy it's the product of someone who's trying to take advantage of people who aren't as tech savvy so that was my first introduction to Eric he's clearly a guy who knows how to get media attention and Market himself self but he kind of lacks that follow through now recently I saw him again on Fox News business and this time he was talking about another company he's part of which also kind of sounded sketchy it's a Tick-Tock competitor called lamotif which in of itself is fine but Eric claimed in this video that it has hundreds of millions of users on this app and frankly I had never heard of it you know I mean we have hundreds of millions of users so I mean we have an amazing you know user growth now look the fact I hadn't heard of this app is no big deal but I went to my phone because I wanted to know more I downloaded this app expecting hundreds of millions of users instead everything I was seeing was like family member levels of Engagement like three to five likes per post you know your mom grandma and dad there was it's a ghost town hardly anyone is on this app so again this is my second red flag once again he kind of over promises under delivers but then comes the motherload of all stories Eric starts talking talking about all his achievements and one of them is when he talks about a project he worked on in Ghana to donate money let me ask you about that project I saw you uh done some work in Ghana uh and it really you just did something that's really historic I think this is important because one thing I love about the d-finance revolution is that it's going to help people who would never really people in Industries and countries that would never really have a chance in a traditional global banking system yeah absolutely I mean basically we did a a crypto version of starlink so it starts off pretty normal he's on national television and he's talking about how he donated uh money you know this is what people talk about when they talk about cryptocurrency banking the unbanked you know saving Africa but then as he gave details I realized literally none of this is necessary um I launched a satellite a few years ago and we put a crypto wallet on there I believe it's the only satellite with the crypto wallet and we were able to beam down to a uniseco and all girls unicef's girl school in Ghana um with the help of the of a member of the gone in government at the ground we were able to ship them an antenna they built it as a school project um it was amazing okay wait just a second you're telling me you launched a satellite put a crypto wall on that satellite and built an antenna to receive that you had to involve the government all to send money isn't there a better way okay if you're already going to be shipping an antenna couldn't you have shipped cash and the punch line is like maybe if it was like millions of dollars it would make sense like oh you can't just ship millions of dollars it was a thousand dollars he donated a thousand dollars to this school in Ghana um and not just any a thousand dollars he donated a thousand dollars worth of a random crypto coin called metal and then literally with no internet they were able to beam down cryptocurrency right down to them by the way I like it how he passes it off as some big achievement of like hey we sent the money even though they didn't have internet but that's not even true they did have internet because you built them an antenna you could have sent them the money that you spent on antennas satellites and talking to the Ghana government you could have sent it to them but why do it that way when you can build and send a satellite to space we were able to ship them an antenna they built it as a school project I I like how he says like yeah they just set up this antenna it's like a fun school project like was it I don't volunteer my free time as a Dish network technician but maybe maybe that's just me maybe I don't know what the the kids are doing in school these days but by the way this isn't even the wildest part because already way too many steps right but remember that Eric paid them in a cryptocurrency which is not used by locals at all or really anyone so guess what happens next I'm a friend's company mine yellow card he runs the largest crypto Exchange in Africa yellow card and he was able to on the ground you know exchange the money for local vendors okay what have we done here after everything all of it the satellite the antenna the the government you've literally had to send a guy with cash you've had to do the thing you were trying to avoid the doing the entire time you're just send them cash to exchange the cryptocurrency what is the achievement here you're just sending the cash with like 12 extra steps but even worse he tries to make it seem like this is the wonders of crypto and space it was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen they're able to fix their roof they didn't even have lunch tables they were eating their food on the ground in the dirt and they're able to get wood for lunch tables I mean this is this is the amazing economy of space no Eric this isn't the amazing economy of space this is the fake philanthropist grift we've seen it thousands of times before you just give small amounts of cash to poor countries but when you do you make sure you bring a camera and you make a media tour out of it while you're at it as I said wouldn't say anything because you know charity is mostly a net benefit no matter the reason but this story was just so wild the lengths they went to to make this seem revolutionary was so ludicrous that I had to make an exception this is the amazing economy of space
