Google Chrome's cookies phase out what you need to know sites will no longer have access to third-party cookies for 1% of chrome users January 4th okay okay full deprecation by the end of the year still depends on UK's competition and markets Authority I have a lot of opinions about this but let's let him cook let's let Tim Cook and then we'll come back okay one of the most critical topics of 2024 how Google Chrome plans to rewrite digital advertising in the browser with privacy sandbox proposal and how companies adopt the Technologies or don't is finally ramping up on January 4th Google is releasing a new browser feature called tracking protection which when activated will cut off s's access to thirdparty cookies tracking protection will be activated for 1% of randomly selected groups of chrome users globally marking the year's first notable step towards third-party cookie deprecation ah look at that isn't that crazy Google's looking out for people look at that this is Fant I'm so happy that Google's concern Ed about me being tracked by third party cookies I mean I'm so happy that Google would most certainly never use this to their advantage by being the only people that can track you across sites and thus using your data to be able to sell more targeted advertisement while stripping out the competition completely and making it into a monopoly I certain would I certainly wouldn't think that would ever happen it's not like Google ever doesn't be evil Google I swear the level of awful Google is is outstanding I'm not saying I like third party cookies okay I'm sick of being tracked I am sick of being tracked and all that yes like I don't care that Twitter monetizes my usage of their site I use a free site in which I give it data and it should be able to sell me ads fine not upset but this Google thing those who are part of the test will see an option to browse with more privacy yet ads still work on Google crazy when they open Chrome on desktop or Android the roll out beyond the 1% will happen gradually in the second half of the year if a site in a test can't function Chrome will surface the option to disable tracking protection and revert to using thirdparty cookies naturally there are a lot of unknowns especially since full deprecation by the end of the year will depend on these tests and whether the UK's competition and markets Authority agrees here's what we know a sense of urgency hampered by lack of resource okay while the adoption has been very slow on the buy side there has been a step change in urgency Paul bannister in Chief strategy officer at publish management platform rapv which has been running the protection audience API renamed from fledge in April in add auction since September when Google made privacy sandbox application programming interfaces publicly available he said that since the beginning of December more marketers have been Keen to start testing over the next three months but there's a gulf between the desire to test and the resources available to invest in new product development in order to execute a full shift to privacy preserving Technologies can someone explain whatever I just read better I don't see how this is anything but Google locking down competition absolutely let's break it down Paul Bannister and Company Paul Bannister is Chief strategy officer at a company named rapes rapv is a publisher management platform which uh means it is do okay yo yo dog I like I don't need that much explanation can can we calm down could you be more tur I ain't got time to read all of that Paul Bannister from rapb is using Google's new privacy sandbox API for add auction set September more marketers are interested in testing these privacy Focus tools however there's a challenge they want to test but developing new products for this requires more resources than currently available I literally still don't know what that means and I don't think Google does either there are those who's still in denial and unfortunately I don't think 2024 is going to be an easy year for them said an mil milisic co-founder of consultant Sparrow advisers why do all these companies sound like there's some sort of weird Shadow form of just Google Jack Sparrow it's not Jack Sparrow what are all these advisor companies they're just different names for Mafia it's Captain Jack Sparrow data launderers it sounds like data launders I'm just curious what is the point of all this as Tech adoption before it it's a chicken and egg situation tech companies need demand before building the tech and the business imperative to shift buying away from cookies have been lacking but Chrome's deadlines finally solidifies that she added still 1% is still too minor for many beginning with just 1% of browsing being impacted there will be little to no immediate impact on things like tracking targeting or measuring in the short term said Paul Bland head of strategy again head of biddable oh this is a different Paul sorry wrong Paul head of biddable at Havis media Network UK we need more insight around the effectiveness of the new solution and the breadth of the adoption across the adtech landscape before we draw conclusions my only curious question is how does does this not give Google Ultimate Authority rap of has been scaling up the numbers of protective audience apis running in auction since September but the findings are too narrow for now while targeting is working the next conversation is getting data on Effectiveness our agency buyer who isn't currently testing said they wouldn't expect to see any impact until at least 30% of cookies were deprecated can I just throw something out there here is the reality Google will never create something that's going to hurt them Consulting agencies will never create something to hurt them governments will never create something they understand that's kind of my three general rules of thumb is companies don't hurt themselves governments don't know what they're doing consultancies are the devil that's kind of like how I position my thought process and so when I'm reading all of this and Google's like we're making privacy better there's an angle that I'm just I don't quite understand yet there's something there government don't know what they're doing is the only W take in this the government's like oh we're not even sure here I'm definitely a bit curious you know that there's there's strategy to this you know that somebody is playing this to make a lot of money and so it has to be reducing some sort of competition you preemptively hurt yourself EG supermarkets asking for ID for energy drinks before expected government regulations even though it didn't exist or charging for plastic bags well charging for plastic bags has I mean the crazier one was was when the governments banned plastic bags and then it ended up using more plastic like was funny and then California was like man we got that wrong and so California actually went back on the plastic bag business and now you can get it but you just have to get charged for it okay stupid but whatever it worked but then the better part is that Colorado is now officially passing the plastic bag thing like how funny is that is that the government did something didn't do the research it turned out it was wrong California went back on hey plus one for government for going back and actually doing some research and doing a good thing I was personally impressed that California did did anything at all that was based on facts or logic like good job that was a good job I was very shocked by that but they did it but then somehow Colorado and everybody else like hell yeah hold my beer we're doing this you know it's just like where did you get where did you get dude the government sucks okay I don't know what people are expecting is going to happen we only use reusable and paper here in VT haven't seen plastic in years wild I just complimented California and I'm from Montana see I'm I'm based okay I can recognize a good decision when I see it figuring out how to reinvent the digital and AD ecosystem in the browser all at once encompasses a raft of features like targeting ad frequency and measurement for now targeting is the most solid banister estimates that Google is about 75% there in terms of what they need to supply to the industry oh okay so Google will supply to the industry okay great including better documentation and improved features measurement will break said Eric wheeler CEO at publisher adtech platform 33 across programmatic measurement was founded on a third-party cookie so we can expect to see many data errors Google analytics will be able to track what occurs in its Walled Garden which will cause a big Upstream challenges the agency buyer added that the industry might need to rethink historical benchmarks since many marketers use pixel Solutions across platforms like a meta as Google increases the 1% of users who have access to tracking protection in the second half of 2024 there will be shifts in auction Dynamics with a shrinking pool of third- party cookie inventory available we can also expect to see Rising cpms oh really crazy see really for those that don't know what CPM it stands for cost per mile so cost per mile here's a here's a good example on YouTube how I get paid by YouTube is when I release a video they sell out ads for say $112 to $18 cost per mile they'll pay me somewhere between like a125 to $2 RPM rate per mile mile equals 1,000 views obviously because miles are 1,000 ft per mile and so it was a natural transition to go from 1,000 feet per mile to 1,000 views per mile what the f is a mile a mile is how how far you can throw a stone in 25 throws 57 throws it's a 57 throw measurement it's one of the most based measurements out there the fact that this is what is going to happen this just means Google makes more money that's all that means YouTube okay so there's this there's this thing that happens for those that don't know there's this one problem that exists which is a company like YouTube has two levers in which they can make money on more ads more expensive ads now they're adding a third level lever obviously which is membership so the more membership they can sell the more kind of defined money they'll make so they have more ads more cost to ads and so they can't really raise this lever cuz this lever is based on an auction system so December it costs a lot that lever just goes up January that lever goes way down because people aren't buying ads so if you can artificially constrain the supply meaning you make that lever go up they automatically win show us the third lever again third lever is YouTube membership don't forget that the lever that lowers creators share in Revenue oh yeah then there's also the fourth lever which is just lower the amount you pay creators that one's a little bit harder because you have to be somewhat concerned about competition I mean I'm not saying that Twitter's great competition for video Mr B said he wouldn't do it I'm not saying that Rumble is great competition I've never even been on Rumble I just know the name because I get emails about converting all my videos to rumble like I don't know a lot about the other platforms but I do know they exist and whenever you keep putting pressure on the creators you'll eventually cause migrations that lever is really hard to move so they typically don't move that lever Tik Tok CPM is awful it's not that bad it's like all shorts in the industry the problem with shorts is that a short is like 30 seconds of view time so you can't show an ad every short it wouldn't make any sense so you show like one ad for every 50 shorts so that's like 150th you should expect like 150th 12th the amount of money from a from a short versus a a long as I like to call it that's just the way it works cuz you watch a ton of shorts and then you get one app so they have to split unless you get 10x to viewership uh too you get a lot more viewership on shorts sort of the problem about shorts is either you get a lot of viewership or you get none I don't understand shorts terrible at them okay anyways I don't really need to know anything of more about adtech and all this it just seems like whatever is going to happen Google wins Consulting companies win the government will say they won and the only loser at the end of the day will be you I hope that there's less ads second thing I might do is buy some Google stock if they're successful they just raised the amount of money they're going to make by 20 to 30% this is not Financial advice aen
