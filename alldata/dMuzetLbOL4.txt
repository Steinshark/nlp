ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the World Chess Championship 2023 contested by yanyipom Nishi of Russia and dingly ren of China this is game number seven and the match is tied three to three with the players trading blows back and forth we've had three decisive games in a row can we make it four game seven had one of the most unexpected twists of the match thus far the tension was Sky High and it was such an exciting battle and you know what else is exciting what I'm about to tell you because I have a massive announcement I wrote a book yep I wrote a book here it is before I show you this game it's called how to win it chess The Ultimate Guide for beginners and Beyond part one is from the absolute basics of the game zero up to about 800 and part two is for the early intermediate players gets you to about 12 1300. this book took me over a year to write it was a team effort and it's officially out for pre-order there's a link in the description you can get it wherever you'd like it will be officially printed later this year in October but this is my massive announcement to all of you if you'd like to pre-order it I will probably do a whole sign copy thing I'll probably do like a little book tour maybe do a couple of stops in a few cities if you want me at your local chess club and you live in a big city uh find a way for them to get in touch massive massive uh news for me and I'm super excited to share it with all of you um the book is uh gonna redefine I think how chess is taught uh in uh in in text form and um I always get a question of what chess book do you recommend well this one will be it you do not need a chessboard to read this book you can read this book before bed and there's QR codes at the end of each chapter to practice I'm so excited about this book um let's jump into game seven of the World Chess Championship link to the book is in the description oh my goodness folks uh this was unbelievable stuff okay began with E4 why did yanyuponishi begin with E4 because the few times that they have played uh that they have played these colors we have had a Spanish and both times we have had some sort of line where ding has gotten the better uh sorry Jan has gotten the better of ding in Spanish that's just the truth so he plays E4 and so far ding has not had an antidote with E5 now the crazy thing is folks E5 is really the only thing taking place so imagine showing up to a one-on-one match for the most prestigious title in chess and your main opening doesn't work I mean seriously it's it's like a movie right it's like a movie it's like a boxer breaks his hand like what do you you still move the pawn you just move it one square oh I don't know the last time dingley run played a French I don't know of French defense in a world championship folks you know something you remember the days of alpha zero those engines that like Alpha zero borderline refuted the French defense computers will never play the French defense against each other because the French defense at a 3700 ELO level is completely refuted it's it's completely refuted but not at human level D4 D5 Knight to D2 and now there are many lines 92 92 is called The Terrace variation black can play A6 H6 Knight F6 C5 Knight C6 they're not all the same D take C4 and C5 so it's one of the main lines in fact I used to play this with black I used to play this position with the black pieces in fact one of my nicest wins ever came in this line in the next move which is this Knight F3 Knight F3 is a move that keeps the tension in the center you are not taking your Knights are guarding your pawns there is another way to play this position which is when you take on D5 and either get some sort of isolated Pawn position uh or black plays Queen takes D5 and uh there's this super interesting lines where it white gets big development but black hangs onto a pawn like I said I used to play this so I know what I'm talking about um now Grandmaster Alexander straponski uh played Knight F3 against me and that was round two of the millionaire chess open 2016 when I got an international Master Norm I took on D4 in that game and then I played Knight C6 and lines usually go like this and then boop boop Bishop D3 and black has a very strong Center but a little bit less space but in this game ding doesn't play Knight C6 he plays kind of the the second line which is Knight F6 attacking the pawns so very very tense position now um white can play E5 here certainly uh White can also take on D5 and then Queen takes D5 is kind of normally uh the move that gets played then there is stuff like Knight B5 Knight A6 and so on and there was actually a game where I think Fabiano caruana blundered a piece like this and he blundered I think he blundered a full piece to Magnus in a Blitz game which is kind of hilarious that that could happen uh but Knight takes D5 is what ding play so ding uh plays a sideline and then plays another sideline kind of he'd be sort of playing something that's very very solid and already we have just a different nature entirely this is not a rue Lopez this is a French but we have Ian D pawns completely traded for white white has no Center pawns black has one Center Pawn uh but a blocked Bishop all right and now Jan plays Knight F3 and then develops the bishop to C4 and here ding plays a novelty so as you can see ding is already up 10 minutes on the clock in the opening Jan the last thing that Jan was expecting uh was a French defense uh and now of course the natural move here is just simply to Castle but rather than canceling ding blit in two minutes plays Knight C6 which has never been played before so we play an opening that I don't know the last time a French defense got played in a world championship I mean maybe in the match Magnus Anan because they were playing all sorts of openings but it's been 10 years like minimum I mean I really don't remember I mean I could be misremembering but I don't remember Knights people play E5 C5 Knight C6 is a very weird move why is it a weird move because why is black voluntarily splitting his pawns right it's just bad structure right what's he doing okay now both sides castle and a fascinating complex position has arisen why well black has an extremely powerfully anchored Knight black has the open B file slightly worse Pawn structure but in the future could trade light scored Bishops could also do this and what does white want well white has a massively open Center so White's gonna play like this setting up an attack gonna put a rook on the open file gonna move the bishop then gonna put the Rook on the other open file also Knight E5 so it's just both sides have a have a have a cornucopia a plethora of ideas in this position all right and uh here's Queen E2 uh Bishop B7 now as you'll notice ding spent 18 minutes on that move that's what happens when you don't play an opening and you play it in a world championship match you just feel the nerves all right like that's just the truth all right like I felt nerves writing a chess book but I did it and you should check it out all right uh Bishop B7 I mean obviously ideas like C5 and opening up look good Queen C7 maybe bringing the Rooks Bishop D3 here from Yana and Jan has a very direct idea he wants to Checkmate his opponent and you would think well that's just tremendously insulting why would he just play Queen E2 Bishop D3 Queen E4 in a world championship match doesn't he know that his opponent is going to see that yep yeah uh and and judging from the time spent on this plan like ten seven minutes another 12 minutes he's not fully convinced that it's the best thing in the world but essentially you play out you play like this because you want to induce your opponent to make a move you either want your opponent to weaken their dark squares or you want your opponent to retreat their Knight and get out of the center uh however uh and I saw Insight uh on Twitter I think from um somebody named Tom Rendell um and I just want to cite my sources and Tom said uh you know French players know like if you're a long time French player you never play a move like Knight F6 I don't care if it stops made and attacks the queen you just don't play that move why because you're undeveloping you need to try to make progress French players know that they're okay weakening their dark squares in in the name of dynamic chess and in this case this is dynamic chess well dingles backwards okay and this allows Queen H4 and now this is going to be a problem as the pieces Stare this way you cannot really play H6 because I got new I'm gonna sack I got news for you um this is really dangerous for black there is no immediate threat but it ain't Pleasant Knight G5 Bishop H7 Knight H is really not pleasant so that doesn't happen but C5 now activates the bishop and the bishop is threatening to chop the Knight because that would severely damage white structure which is why instead of letting him chop the Knight and severely weaken a structure Yang plays the move Bishop to F4 and Knight to E5 he had no other way of doing that and at this point going Knight G5 doesn't make any sense because then I will play H6 and there is no sacrifice because the bishop cannot jump over at night and if you try to go back and set that up well black now gets a move and attacks your queen okay so Bishop F4 is a very nice idea hitting the queen and getting access to E5 now B2 is not capturable taking on B2 in general is very dangerous b2b7 they're known as the poison Pawn because oftentimes taking them opens up very very unnecessary complications I don't know what a complication is because that's when you go camping and then there's complications Rook B1 here would simply win the bishop um so that's not hanging and also Knight C4 now again white has a better structure what does that mean white has three three like it's just better to have three pawns together okay it's just now black has a nice solid four but it would be better if that pawn was on B6 these these pawns are just end game liabilities but when you have a bad structure you have a non-traditional structure meaning you don't have two four or three three like remember the Chopsticks game four two three three like um you you but you have like space around the pawns so because even though you have a little damage structure you'd be files open b-file normally wouldn't be open so yeah it's pluses and minuses all right give and take all right Rook d8 now you'll notice ding spent 16 minutes bringing his Rook to the center so both players really feeling the gravity of their moves all right like Rook d8 is not a move and he was criticized in fact Rook Diego is the only move it is the only move in this position which is fascinating it like every every other move is bad so he spent 60 minutes he finds the best move but again now he's down 36 minutes on the clock that's a lot of time that's nearly double this time and Jan brings this rook and Jan has four pieces Brewing an attack and maybe five and I got news for he brings us up once maybe six so this is around when I woke up okay I woke up like 7am because I can't sleep nowadays uh because I'm excited I'm excited for the match so I tuned in I'm like oh my God what a clash you know what a clash of positions now Jan could have played Rook Effie one Jan also could have played Rook 81 uh both of those moves were good I guess he went uh here because he wanted to bring this and also have an opportunity to play a four like if his F Pawn wasn't here and his King was tucked away I mean he would have a monster attack now ding here has a permanent question to ask which is do I like my Bishop or do I like White's Bishop more okay which Bishop do I like which Bishop is better like which but should I get rid of this bishop but what about my Bishop I don't have a bishop anymore so I don't know I don't that's but eval stays around the same he plays G6 so he does now weaken his dark squares but he permanently removes the problem of this bishop hitting him over here so Jan now takes advantage and plays Bishop to G5 and applies pressure but here we show the justification of this move actually black is completely lost here completely lost if not for this move which is why you needed to play Rook d8 in the few in in the in the past because now as Jan is bullying him over here ding slips and throws the left uppercut like McGregor Mayweather Rook to D4 oh my oh my and now we see the benefit of having the imbalance Pawn structure the queen is hit and the queen doesn't have a comfortable life now and I got news for you the Rook knows his duty if the Rook gets stuck in the center The Rook does not belong in a crowded Center because the Rook the rook's got nowhere to run so what's going to happen is if this Rook ever gets trapped that Rook knows that he's going to serve the duty to the king he's going to sacrifice himself this is unbelievable this is an extremely tense battle out of an opening you've never seen a World Chess Championship which very well may lead to a fourth decisive game in a row which is completely unheard of which is completely unheard of you know what else is unheard of QR codes at the end of Chess book chapters I mean have you ever heard of that seriously check the book out Queen H3 now ding plays Queen C7 ding has 25 minutes on the clock to make 21 moves that ain't good I mean 25 minutes is a lot of time all right but now for 21 moves that is a minute to move barely barely now this was one of the most tense moments in this position Jan had a borderline winning idea by borderline winning idea what I mean is it was winning except for one Miracle resource Jan could have went here kicked out the rook and played F4 and again that plan is now completely Justified and in fact white is completely like better and maybe just gonna win this game if not for one defensive resource by black which is the miracle shot C4 C4 is so random and the idea of C4 is to slow white down hit the bishop if you take on C4 I immediately create counter play on your position so you gobble the pawn but you open up my lines all right and also you're taking a step in the wrong direction if you take like this which also looks really natural Rook D2 is a knockout punch like you straight up gonna lose the game it's not about me catching up and getting activity so ding I don't know if he saw C4 but Jan clearly did that was what Anish giri thought Anish giri was like oh I have my delivery at the door hello yeah just leave it at the door please thank you so much there you go we're getting a lot of cool stuff in this recap I gotta I got a coffee and a little breakfast I hope you have a good breakfast or lunch so maybe C3 was seen but maybe he saw C4 maybe maybe Neville was like what the how is there's C4 in this position this is ridiculous all right and when C4 happens suddenly black is getting a lot of counter play so what does young do plays B3 completely shutting down C4 but look at that look at that Knight H5 oh my God ding is taking over ding is taking over Knight to H5 and this is a move clearly over complete maybe overlooked underestimated maybe Jan got a little bit too distracted with the counter play of pontus C4 and decided okay I'm gonna play B3 but he missed the counter play of Knight H5 he missed the counter play of Knight H5 and after F4 in this position there are a myriad of possibilities just a an ocean of possibilities black can play Bishop takes G5 F takes G5 opening up the rook and then play Knight F4 cutting the circulation between the rook and the F Pawn then the queen will infiltrate and then black will play C4 all the same this is completely announced Knight G4 is borderline made but F5 F5 Knight F6 Rook F6 Pawn F6 and CD3 Pawn F7 check Queen F7 Rook F4 Rook F4 Queen F4 and when the dust settles it's equal because black can defend oh my what even is this what even is this there are so many unbelievable complications in this position so many F4 leads to just an ocean an ocean of nonsense well in this position ding plays Bishop D6 now ding also could have played Bishop F6 ding also could have played Knight G7 and maybe with a knight here maybe tried to play F6 because the Knight defense of the E6 Pawn but he plays Bishop D6 because he has to make moves fast he has 21 minutes nepo C3 wait a minute 40 minutes to 21 it's now 26-21 both guys got no time both guys are low on time and the Rook is trapped I told you the Rook is going to be trapped in the center of the board and in this position after the move C3 white is winning if not for one resource the miracle shot Knight takes F4 a brilliant move by dingly Wren Knight F4 sends the position for an absolute tailspin the idea of Knight F4 is very simple you can't take the Rook cause your queen is hanging now in the game nepo played this but he could have played Rook takes F4 with the idea of Rook F4 Bishop F4 and this is protected but that is not what was going to get played what was going to get played as Bishop takes E5 and in this position white has the move Bishop G6 threatening a mate on H7 and simultaneously opening up the H file with the idea of CD4 Bishop F4 Bishop F6 and Unstoppable made on H6 but that is not the end of the story because after ag6 CD4 who said I have to take your Rook I'm just gonna come here and then after rookie five Queen E5 Bishop F6 threatening a mate you don't take you don't give a check you give a check here send The Rook back so it cannot go to H4 and you force a queen trade and if Rook F4 and I try to mate you Rook C8 Rook H4 Rook C1 is mate you mate me nah Rook C1 is mate Pawn on E3 covers F2 this is this what is even happening Knight takes F4 every piece is this can take this this can take this this can take this this can take this and that can take that and queen is coming this is so insane Bishop F4 is what Yan chooses but now Rook sacrifice Rook F4 Bishop E5 Rook H4 a direct line of assault and in this position just very cool common collected Rook to d8 folks dingley Wren is playing for a win with black this is unheard of he sacrificed an exchange and he is unafraid of Rook takes H7 he's not afraid because if Rook takes D3 Queen D3 King H7 and furthermore the dark Square Bishop will completely prevent mate forever you're just never getting mated here Bishop B4 played by Young 21 minutes to 19 the time is even the position is better for black better might be a strong word I mean it's black is maybe the one playing for a win now if you are down a rook for a bishop which is being down in exchange obviously pawns matter in this case black has an extra Pawn so bishop and upon those four points versus a rook which is Five Points so technically white is up a point of material but why is the evaluation better for black because the position is so good that black gets that extra point of Advantage handed back to them now probably you should play Bishop A6 you should probably not trade Bishops because the more pieces that get traded if you do the math it's going to end up versus Rook Rook versus bishop and on an empty board The Rook destroys the bishop all right on an empty board like a basketball player a really good basketball player destroys another really good really good basketball player maybe but on a team it's very different story so Bishop A6 and if you try to close the bishop out then I'm gonna get a bishop here and I'm gonna play a five and um now here ding trades the Bishops clearly unfazed Jan goes back to H4 but that's a fake threat and this is the closest the time has been the whole match Queen D6 played by ding he's but he it's minus point seven oh my oh my goodness dingly Wren is on the verge of winning a game with black he's about to win two games in a row this is mind-blowing the point of Queen D6 is very simple you can't take your queen is not strong enough to guard both Rooks it's over you can play King F1 I'm gonna play Queen to D2 you can do this I got Bishop C3 on the cards if I really want it there is no mate I didn't even realize that I was hanging a bishop so I'm gonna shut up and find a better move okay much better I mean it's it it was still winning it was just gonna be a queen end game well now it's made um wow I can't believe this is happening Rook Queen back to E3 and ding is in control he plays H5 there is now no more problems ever he is just clearly better Yan plays G3 the thing is both guys have to make 10 moves so both guys have to play very fast 11 minutes here for ding 13 minutes for young all right a lot of possibilities you can already start trying to break up the queen side a little bit but Bishop F6 is a perfectly reasonable move it doesn't commit much it just attacks The Rook The Rook goes to C4 now again you don't have a lot of you don't have a lot of time here you can just play King G7 if you really want to okay you can play a random move you can just basically pass the move back to your opponent quickly and not do anything no no dingley Wren plays H4 he sacrifices his H Pawn to open up White's King this man is a man on a mission but he's got to play a little bit more quickly because he's only got five and a half minutes all right he's giving everybody a heart attack he's got to make nine moves in five and a half minutes GH4 and now the full justification of the plan has arrived you can play Rook H5 or or you completely ignore the spawn because these pawns are bozos and instead you go here and you line up the Cannons you line up the Cannons if you play Rook to E2 I sneak in on the back rank you don't want that I got all sorts of ideas I got Rook D3 ideas after Bishop takes H2 as well all right so G takes H4 played dingly Ren is officially taking over the game and here's something completely insane happens ding plays Rook D2 now you might think what's what what I don't know what happened look at things time ding proceeded to physically freeze at the board at this point he has to make nine more moves in five and a half minutes that's actually not that crazy ding spent five minutes on this move he physically could not bring himself to move I don't know what happened Anish giri was just saying like it happens you just completely freeze it's just like too many thoughts colliding at the ding played Rook D2 he now has 45 seconds on the clock ding has to make eight moves in 45 seconds that might not be physically possible every single move he has to make in five seconds or he will lose on time and on the very next move Jan responded rookie two cutting off The Rook ding immediately made a mistake he had to give a check he had to avoid an exchange by either coming back and defending or giving a check he attacks the queen and just blunders a pawn he didn't blunder the pawn what he probably blundered was that this end game is just I mean it's just lost like I said you cannot trade so many pieces so Rook D1 check and it goes from bad to worse as after Queen D3 Rook F2 that's it the bishop is hit check is coming in and mate is going to happen on f8 or F7 dingly Wren played one more move with three seconds on the clock and resigned the most unbelievable turnaround I I have ever seen maybe in my life honestly dingley Ren was taking over this game and the nerves got the better of him he he played he played his move with 45 seconds on the clock and it and just a full tailspin a total spin out of control and out of nowhere has taken game seven and a 4-3 lead in this match this is absolutely wild stuff folks this is wild I I I I have no idea what to expect for game number eight if dinkin bounced back from this he he is the toughest man alive but oh my goodness it's 4-3 Young what a match and just when you thought we were out of plot twist we get another one and check out the book now get out of here
