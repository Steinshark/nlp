hello everyone and welcome i have been driving the 2017 subaru impreza which got me curious about how its all-wheel drive system works which got me curious about how the other subaru all-wheel drive systems work and so here we are with all four different systems that subaru currently employs as their all-wheel drive setups so we're going to work our way through all four of them now the impreza that i'm driving has a cvt so it uses an active torque split system but we're going to start off with the simplest system the viscous center differential this is actually what i have in my crosstrek so up front we have the engine that is sending power to the transmission from the transmission to a viscous center differential which splits that torque 50 50 front to rear so it sends it to that front differential and the rear differential up front you have an open diff in the rear you also have an open diff and that's the general layout that subaru uses in any of their manual transmission vehicles which are currently sold and a lot of these actually date back and are still relevant um you know 10 15 20 years ago as far as some of the models there are some minor changes which have been made to some of them but overall a lot of these systems are still relevant even if you have an older subaru probably applies that if you have a manual transmission it's very similar to this style so the current impreza wrx crosstrek and forester all use this setup and another thing that they do with the all-wheel drive system uh here you know 50 50 split is good if one of these axles starts to spin that viscous coupling will force more torque to go to the wheel that has more traction so you can send more torque to the front axle or the rear axle whichever one has more grip and then if one of your tires is spinning the brakes will actually kick in and break that individual tire so that you can send more torque to the wheel which does have traction and so you know overall you'll be sending more torque to that axle resulting in more acceleration by using the brakes if one of those wheels is slipping now moving over to the active torque split system and if you get lost uh just as a a reminder we've got a key right here so engine front differential center differential coordinating with our numbers there so you can reference that if you like anyways the super impreza which i've been driving this is the system which it uses active torque split and basically you've got your engine that is sending power to the transmission from the transmission there is actually a multi-plate center clutch pack it's not a differential in this case and that clutch pack is going to have a certain amount of pressure to allow for a 60 40 split front to rear and this is the same system basically any subaru vehicle which has a cvt transmission except for the wrx will be using this system uh so that includes the legacy in the outback as well as the impreza crosstrack and forester and so that clutch pack is actually designed to allow for slip it's designed to last while still slipping the material selection the amount of pads that they have the oil in there you know it's obviously a wet multi-plate clutch and so it applies a certain amount of pressure for a nominal 60 40 split and then if you have a reduction of traction on one of these axles you can lock up that clutch pack apply more pressure and send torque to the wheels which need it you also okay and that split is of course going to an open differential and an open rear differential just like with the manual transmission version um and this was also used on four-speed automatics some of the older subaru's uh used that used four-speed automatic transmissions uh had this system in them now the reason it's called active is because it's it's not just waiting for wheel slip in order for it to lock this up it's also looking at certain engine sensors and vehicle sensors throttle transmission sensor ecu wheel speed sensors and it's taking in all that data and saying okay is this a scenario where it's likely that you know there may be a loss of traction uh you know if you're flooring it then you're probably gonna have more weight on the rear so it'll apply pressure to that clutch pack so you can get more power to the rear wheels things like that so it's gonna have a logic built in based on what you're doing based on how you're driving uh to adjust that multi-play clutch and that's why they call it active so moving right along to the variable torque distribution and this is a pretty cool setup this is only used in the cvt wrx the manual wrx using this system similar to the other vehicles the only vehicle currently using this variable torque distribution is the cvt wrx now it was also used in subaru's five-speed automatic transmission vehicles in the past of course they don't have those uh today and none of this relates to the subaru brz because it's rear-wheel drive we're just talking about all-wheel drive here so uh basic layout you have your engine to the transmission that is sending power to both a center differential a planetary style center differential which has through gearing a nominal torque split of 45 to the front 55 to the rear and so the reason it's a little different than these setups a little more going to the rear is to reduce understeer because you know during acceleration you want to be able to send more power to the rear wheels so that's what they're allowing for for sport oriented vehicles like the wrx it makes sense to have a rear bias so that's what they've done you have that center differential as well as the electronic hydraulic transfer clutch so you've got a clutch that you can lock up send more power to the axle which needs it and this number six here is just our transmission control module so it'll adjust how much lockup you have depending on the scenario if you need to send more torque to one axle uh you can now today's wrx uh actually has an open differential in the front in the rear some of the older versions uh and some of the older vehicles out there like the outback uh there are some older examples out there which have the five-speed automatic and actually had a viscous limited slip differential in the rear uh today's versions are using an open differential and then finally we get to the subaru sti which is the only vehicle which uses a driver controlled center differential and this is kind of like the holy grail of subaru's all-wheel drive systems super sophisticated super cool and perhaps someday i'll do a breakdown in more detail of how some of these actually look and work but basically you've got your engine sending power to the transmission then sending it to a planetary style and mechanical limited slip differential as well as an electronic differential in that center which you can lock up and so you've got that multi-plate clutch you have the transmission control module which we'll be adjusting based on you know driver inputs things like that same kind of deal as we had over here but you also have the driver controlled center differential controls so the driver themself can choose you know hey i want to lock it up completely or i wanted to you know mostly a rear bias and this has that 4159 through the gearing nominal split and so that that split you know even more aggressive sending more power to the rear wheels make it a little bit more agile make it a bit more less understeer prone and you know a more agile more capable performance vehicle because you're gonna have weight transfer to the rear as you're accelerating hard and it has a decent amount of power now in the front you have a helical limited slip differential in the rear you have a torso limited slip differential and then in the center you've basically got two differentials a mechanical limited slip diff and then you also have an electronic locking clutch multi-plate clutch there so very sophisticated system that really is going to allow for you in pretty much any scenario to be able to put traction down to whichever wheel needs it so super cool what they've done they also do use torque vectoring probably across the line but definitely in the sti so if you're coming into a corner they call it torque vectoring it's more direct yacht control where you're using the brakes uh to help rotate the vehicle so if you're coming into a left-hand corner you'll break the inside brake a little bit more than the outside and that allows to help rotate the vehicle so pretty cool what they've done and these are all the systems which they have so you know good overview uh depending on you know which subaru you're getting into which one you're driving uh different capabilities here is there one that's necessarily the best well from a grip standpoint that's going to offer you the most than this one and then between these you know it's not exactly clear if this can fully lock up then it would technically be able to send more torque to one axle than this one because this viscous uh coupling will never fully lock it'll just spin up and as a result you know you maybe send it eighty percent to the front axle or the rear axle uh you know in a worst case scenario but you've got those brakes remember that you can help mitigate any issues if one wheel starts to spin now one of the things that the literature loves to point out if you look into these is that they say you know these vehicles these three here here and here these three setups have the ability to lock for a maximum 50 50 split and that doesn't quite make sense to me and i'm not sure why they say 50 50 split because okay sure any of these systems could lock up and provide a 50 50 split but that's like saying okay let's take any of these and make them act just like this one and you know the downside of this this is the nominal split it's good to have a 50 50 split but if one axle can only put down less torque it doesn't make sense you want to send 80 percent or 100 to one axle so it's misleading to say that at max lock up you're gonna get a 50 50 split if you lock the centers of enter any of these consider it more like a locked differential where if the rear has no traction you're going to still need to rotate the front in order to rotate the rear and as a result you'll have more torque going to the front so rather than 60 40 going down to 50 50 you could have that go up to 80 20 90 10 whatever the limit of this clutch pack allows but i would say you know maximum torque split you're going to get is going to be different it's not going to be 50 50 when you lock it up it's going to be whatever traction allows for and so if one axle doesn't have good traction one has great traction the one with great traction will get significantly more it's not going to be this always set at 50 50 split so hopefully this has been enlightening both about all-wheel drive systems and perhaps if you own a subaru your own vehicle's all-wheel drive system if you guys have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thanks for watching [Music] you
