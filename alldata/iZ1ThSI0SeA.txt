hot off the presses we are now in third place dude what has been billed as a sign of success turns out to be probably millions of dollars of either brian's money or the donator's money welcome to the 10 million studio i'm in a good mood today i'm not going to lie to you and it's because this is proven me right i didn't think i was so so sensitive to being right and feeling good about it but it's true i'm human and when this stuff happens where i've just been proven absolutely correct about my prediction and you know all my uh you know reporting on brian rose it is incredible it's a good feeling so we're taking a slow day because we're just gonna you know it's a nice easy lap in here because brian rose has been pushing for mayor of london after his failed bid with this freedom platform thing no one knows where the money went so okay so he kind of abandoned that and he's like running for mayor now and for a while he's been building himself as i'm in second place guys i'm about to win just to gin up all his supporters excitement and he was pointing to one thing in particular and that is the bookie odds right the bookies they always know what's going on in politics not the pollsters don't ignore the polls instead you gotta focus on the bookies check it out okay big news to report we are now officially in second place to be your next mayor of london paddy power which i think is the biggest uh betting agency in the world has just put us in second place so that's like pretty crazy right i mean here's this guy starting off bidding for mayor of london he's like saying i'm in second place you look at the bookies he is in second place i was wondering what's going on i mean i had some theories whatever but it seemed shocking to me and i was like wow this is i wonder if there's something going on behind the scenes i don't understand i wonder if there's a uprising of brian rose donators in london that i didn't know existed what's going on cause you look at the polls he's like in last place like last last last place he's a nobody but he's on social media like peacocking basically saying i'm winning he has a bunch of things like we won we won we're winning we're moving into to whatever hall on july 1st whatever i don't know uk politics i don't know when you guys are doing your elections the point is the only thing i know is that brian rose was parading himself around as if he's gonna win the next mayor of london and i just was bothered by that not because i'm in the uk it's not gonna affect me at all but i was just disturbed by the grift i was like well i don't want the grifter to win this guy had just moved from i'm a freedom of speech man to i'm the uk london man and it's all about the donations that's what i realized was it's all about that sweet money dude and if you do donate i got some things for you i was calling it out and i honestly i was the only one covering this guy until we have a bombshell from betfair now who is betfair well you go here turns out they merge with patty power and that is the bookmaker that brian rose is parading around as proof that he's like ahead paddy power which i think is the biggest uh betting agency in the world has just put us in second place he's going batty power they're safe they would never get it wrong they're saying that i'm in second place so i must be in second place well this story finally blew wide open just wide open with this rose gamble makes little sense okay and i'm just going to read this out to you because it's it's truly incredible so either they need to find a celebrity figure you disassociate from the wider national party man blah blah perhaps that was the logic of brian rose being gambled into 5-0 uh and still trading at 50 00 which is 49 to 1. rose is an ex-banker he's known for promoting conspiracy theories he carries all the hallmarks of post-truth grifters that have risen on social media during the age of trump and putin perhaps that explained some of the money for him either as a publicity device or from devoted fans either way this was one of the most bizarre gambles ever seen in uk politics and then let me emphasize this he has never impacted polling brian will not be mayor or even finish top four take that to the bank like wow okay first of all that says a few things number one this validates what we've been saying which is that he was just purely gambled into uh into second place in the betting odds because if you just put a large enough bet in some on somebody the bookies aren't going to be exposed to that much risk so they're gonna like change the odds right for who's like the favorite to win and so clearly either brian rose put his own money down or somebody else put their some really bad money on brian rose because he's gonna lose and they're they're all saying like yeah he's there's no way he's gonna win nobody would ever think this guy's gonna win but some random person put some huge bets on this guy so i uh listen brian's a fan of conspiracy theories i have my own conspiracy theory for you guys this is not fact this is not proven this is an opinion did brian rose use donators money to bankroll himself at a second place for a publicity stunt so he could like start bragging about the fact that he's in second place is that what's going on because if so that's incredible if it's just brian supporters who are losing their money and losing their shirts on brian rose because they think brian's gonna win and he's not that's sad but also you you should have known i mean this guy has nothing to offer he's lied about getting arrested lied about a criminal record done this the free speech platform disaster right which no he never talks about anymore and you know you're at the phase where you think to yourself what is brian going to do after what is he qualified to do what are people going to support him doing because now he split his audience only people from london are even watching him because all the content is london related but he's never gonna win in a london mayoral campaign so my question is this what's his next move i think honestly look i'm looking like nostradamus lately with brian rose so i'm going to get yes i think he's going to spin this into it's a conspiracy theory against me and he's going to go in the david ike direction or like kind of like i'm the fringe guy who the the establishment doesn't want and he's going to ride that gravy train into the ground get more donations but he's gonna make it seem like it was rigged against him when in actuality he never had a chance he literally gambled his way or somebody did gambled his way into second place in the bookies but as it says right here he has never impacted the polling brian could have spent all that energy in doing his silly little podcast and it would nothing would have changed uh that's what he should have done that's what he should return to but i don't think it is i have a feeling that after this defeat it's gonna be i don't know what his next move is but strutting around london and declaring yourself in second place isn't a good luck if you end up placing last i mean it's just embarrassing hey uh future steven here really important update so i contacted the author of this article because he seemed to have in with uh and in with patty power and i asked him how much do you think it took to bet brian all the way up to where he was because i was interested how much money he put on himself if it is himself that put the money on there this guy the political gambler again the guy who wrote the article not that much to be honest only 423 000 in total matched on him and much of that will be other traders cashing in on the madness plus when an advanced knowledge of the gamble loading up at 40 to 50k would leave plenty of cushion whoa just think of how insane this stunt is it's almost as dumb as his big billboard stunt that he's doing right now show that real quick he's gone completely mad anyways i wanted to put this in because it's like crazy new evidence anyway back to the video but anyways guys this feels like the sad end of a sort of sad campaign from a sad grifter i don't even know what to do with brian rose making these videos at this point is just kind of this weird thing where i feel like obligated i gotta do it and so uh yeah hopefully brian finds something else to do that is not politics related not grifter conspiracy related maybe you can just go back to making regular podcasts i don't know anyway that's basically it thanks for watching see you next time wake up and smell the coffee
