how are the two candidates you interviewed 
yeah you know honestly both were really great   candidates but there were some things that stood 
out to me for both of them one though being the   number two candidate I think I'm gonna go with 
them because they had way more certifications on   their resume than candidate number one you have 
a deciding factor between the two they both seem   to have really great Knowledge and Skills yeah 
honestly it's not even about you know having the   number of certifications you have but more so 
showing that you're willing to take initiative   they're continuing to learn and grow their skills 
and it looks better for the company to hire   someone with more certifications more qualified 
yeah it makes sense and also too it just shows   that you're more dedicated and willing to continue 
to level up in this video I'm going to be sharing   with you the top 10 Tech certifications for 2024. 
we are going to dive into a variety of different   areas of certification so if you are someone who 
might not be 100 certain as to where you want to   take your career in the next year this video is 
for you you want to level up stand out from the   crowd out and gain a really interesting 
certification alright let's get into it   foreign at number one can you guess what 
it is I feel like it's been in the number   one spot for quite a while now or a few years 
anyways of course it's AWS that's your hint AWS   certified Solutions architect the professional 
certification earlier on in this video we spoke   about the associate one after you have completed 
that the next step is the professional this really   has become the gold standard for engineers 
who want to design and deploy architecture   on Amazon's public cloud and as we know so many 
companies are utilizing AWS and Amazon it's one   of those things that if you are looking for 
a certification that guarantees you a way to   level up or stand out from the crowd you know 
this certification is exactly that now what's   required to take the certification well for one 
you need at least two years of working experience   with AWS other things that are required you 
must know at least one scripting language   have expertise in AWS apis and consoles and 
also to a familiarity with both Linux and   windows there are more prereq because it's to 
this one as expected with the number one spot   however you do earn a very nice salary with this 
on average around 170 U.S which is around 13 to 15   000 more than the average earnings of an associate 
certificate holder so number one spot not only for   being more in demand but also too because of 
you will guarantee a very good compensation   not just based on the certification but also 
to your experience you have in achieving that   certification coming in at number two is certified 
ethical hacker and this is an area that I have I   always fantasize about well I wonder if I did this 
certification or you know different there's so   many different opportunities in Tech and then 
even making this list and doing my research I   always get excited about should I go down this 
path or should I focus on the cloud and it's   one of those things that is easy to do because 
there are so many great opportunities and I'm   sure many of you have felt this way as well where 
it's almost like I want to do everything and in   turn I don't know exactly where to start coming in 
at number three is cism or certified information   security manager this actually used to hold the 
certification used to hold number one or number   two for many years quite a few years back actually 
but it's still in the top ten and I think this   is because it's really Fallen a little bit behind 
some of its rival uh certifications the cissp and   also to the crisc certifications other security 
certifications however I really wanted to include   it in this list for two reasons one because I 
didn't want to make this entire list you know some   of the top top popular security certifications but 
include other ones as well that maybe you haven't   heard about but are very high in demand now for 
this certification your job is essentially to   design and engineer security protocols and also to 
manage a company's overall I.T security so it's a   pretty a big job now according to skillsoft cisms 
are really well paid you can make an average of   a hundred and sixty two thousand a year U.S The 
Cisco certified devnet professional certification   and I really like actually on their website they 
have a really good chart that kind of explains   the knowledge domains recommended experience and 
also supported job role so if you're interested   in this certification I'll link it down below I'll 
link it all down below so you can really go check   each one out so for example in knowledge domains 
20 software Dev 20 understanding and using apis   20 Cisco platform so it's pretty evenly spaced 
out that you don't necessarily need to be 100   expert in software development or 100 expert 
in using apis but have a solid understanding   of these different areas for levels of experience 
I think this is a really good one too if you are   earlier out in your career three to five years of 
experience designing and implementing applications   that are built on top of Cisco platforms with 
experience in Python so earlier on in your career   meeting even if you are just under the three-year 
experience level it's something to really start   looking into this is a great certification 
for anyone who is looking to build with   Cisco platforms but also to get into the devops 
space so when I'm looking up salary for this one   obviously there isn't a specific one for Cisco 
but let's go by devops because that's kind of the   umbrella of what the certification offers now 
on levels FYI for devops the medium total comp   salary in US is 145 000 which sounds right to 
me and you know it's one of those things that   having more certifications and experience combined 
will really help that grow up grow up go up coming   in at number five wait why do I look different 
like this is filmed another day because as I was   uploading these videos I realized I missed doing 
number five and it was too good that I needed to   ensure to include it coming at number five is 
Microsoft certified Azure Solutions architect   expert I have up here on screen the Microsoft 
website that goes through what is required in   this certification one thing you can see on the 
site that it says is as a Solutions architect you   have subject matter expertise in designing cloud 
and hybrid solutions that run on Azure some things   include compute network storage monitoring and 
security now there are some prerequisites for this   course some of them could be Azure administrator 
associate or another one who could be designing   Microsoft Azure infrastructure Solutions so 
this isn't a certification that you can take   without these prerequisites but it is definitely 
something to work towards and even starting with   one of the other ones they offer and working your 
way towards this all right so what kind of salary   can you expect with this certification well this 
one was not on levels FYI so what I did is found   one on ZipRecruiter the average salary of azure 
Solutions architects in the US is 152 000 and this   can definitely go up once again based on years of 
experience and so many other factors so take this   with a grain of salt but it's definitely something 
to work towards coming in at number six is Google   professional certified Cloud architect wait did 
I get that right Google Certified professional   Cloud architect these certifications I tell you 
they are mouthfuls but nonetheless they are so   important one thing I noticed when I was doing 
a lot of research on in demand certifications   for 2024 was the need for really two areas 
three areas let me rephrase that one being   Cloud the other being data and the third being 
security now there are some other certifications   that are in the mix between that that we speak 
about but those are the three main areas I have   seen so far and I think it's interesting because 
one of the things I was expecting to see is more   certifications around artificial intelligence as 
AI can continues to really Skyrocket however I do   think a lot of these certifications can be applied 
to specific Industries such as AI professionals   with a certification are valued for their ability 
to design manage and create and secure scalable   solutions for Google Cloud now it's important to 
note although this is Google Cloud related one   of the things that gaining these certifications 
does is even if you end up working for a company   that does not use Google Cloud specifically it 
shows that you are capable of leveling up taking   a course and getting certifications so don't 
let that stop you as too I'm so stuck between   something on Amazon or Google I don't know which 
one to take at the end of the day yes you may need   to take another certification but that won't 
be necessarily A make or break for a company   hiring you all right because I'm trying to stay 
consistent I'm on levels FYI and they don't have   one for specifically Google Cloud Architects so 
let's use solution architect salary just to get   a rough overview the medium total comp in US 
is a hundred and eighty nine thousand which   seems pretty accurate to me and I think the more 
specialized you are this number could really go   up coming in at number seven it wouldn't be a 
list if we didn't include some AWS courses or   certifications that's because they really 
are the golden standard especially when it   comes to anything Solutions architect related 
or Cloud related number seven is AWS certified   Solutions architect the associate version now this 
certification will really test your knowledge and   expertise in designing systems on the AWS Cloud 
for this certification AWS recommends at least a   year of hands-on experience so it's one of those 
certifications that you actually don't need to   have you know five plus years of experience you 
can really start diving in today this exam takes   around 80 minutes and is admined minister at 
PSI centers across the U.S now one of the things   I really love about the AWS certifications is 
there is so many resources online to really start   leveling up your skills and learning and studying 
I mean there are so many study groups online to   study for these courses and certifications because 
it is so popular now online here it says AWS   certified Solutions Architects make an average of 
155 per year now this might require you to have   a bit more experience in one year on your resume 
however it is definitely something to work towards   coming in at number eight is for all you project 
managers out there or maybe you are a developer   looking to grow into a project management 
role and guess what exam it is this one's   been around for a while and is just continuing 
to be updated which is PMP project management   PNP what is this project management professional 
because that's what you're going to become in 2024   there's a lot of talk of new technology coming 
out and how to really upskill the technical side   but we often forget we need project managers 
to support these projects to keep them moving   forward support the team members and getting the 
certification isn't necessarily a requirement   for a project manager however I have seen as this 
space becomes more and more competitive the need   to really stand out with a certification like PMP 
now what is the average salary for someone with a   PMP certification for a project manager well once 
again on levels FYI the median total comp for   us is a hundred and thirty two thousand now once 
again I could say this for every role so I promise   you I won't but at the end of the day it really 
comes back to the experience you have not just   about the certification and I know for me anyways 
when speaking to project managers this seems   definitely on the low end for total comp coming in 
at number nine is cissp and on some lists this was   ranked even lower for a lot of list it was ranked 
higher so I thought you know what based on the   other ones that are coming up this is where it's 
going to go certified information system security   professional now what does this individual do well 
first of all on many of these lists it's ranked as   one of the best first certifications to take so 
if you haven't taken too many certifications in   the past and you're looking to level up especially 
in the area of security this could be a very good   first certification this certification was created 
by the International Information System security   certification contessorium that is a mouthful this 
certification teaches you how to be information   assurance Pros so people who are usually 
responsible for determining the security aspects   of an I.T organization's overall architecture 
controls and management so if you are interested   in really leveling up your security skills and 
moving your career in that direction this is a   great certification for you and this certification 
continues to grow closer to number one each year   at least for the past few years because security 
is one of those areas that is continuing to grow   grow in demand I mean we'd see all the time on 
the news or social media the hackings that are   happening around the world a lot of times at these 
major companies and as these big companies who   will pay a premium to have people who have taken 
these certifications and have expertise in these   skills now on average you have to have a minimum 
of five years worth of relevant experience for   this certification and based on that you can 
expect an average compensation of around 160   000 U.S per year now it's one of those things 
that it really depends on the size of company   you work for and exactly how many years of 
experience you have coming in at number 10   on the list is certified data professional or CDP 
in 2024 one thing that will remain the same or if   anything continue to increase is the demand for 
experts in data data is I mean we've heard it so   many times before the new oil or at this point 
maybe it's the old oil for how frequent that's   been said now within this credential there are 
many different job roles that can be filled from   business analytics data analytics data governance 
governance the list goes on I'm on their website   here and there is a ton of different options now 
this requires for the assistant certified data   professional exam it requires two exams One 
60-minute Foundation data management exam and   a 60-minute foundation Information Systems core 
exam both of these exams have to be passed at 50   or higher now what type of salary can you expect 
with this certification well let's pause there   for a second before I even share that information 
I want to make one thing clear no matter how many   certifications you take it doesn't automatically 
equate to the salary you will have it takes years   of experience it takes real world applications 
it's not as though you can just go out and get   a certification and the next thing you know you're 
a millionaire however having these certifications   really will help you stand out from so many others 
who are applying for roles or if you are working   on say a promotion standing out from the crowd now 
as I mentioned there are a ton of different roles   that entail data so let's start with data let's 
go to levels FYI so for data scientists the medium   total comp in us is a hundred and sixty thousand 
now once again if you scroll down on levels FYI   you can see that this salary really increases 
depending on how many years of experience you have   all right those are my top 10 Tech certifications 
for 2024. listen there are so many certifications   out there you could say Tiff you didn't include 
this one or why didn't you add this one that at   the end of the day I really wanted to make a 
list that would satisfy many different roles   this isn't the top Tech certification list for 
security or for cloud Architects I wanted to   make one that had a bit of everything so if you 
are someone who's watching this and you might not   be 100 certain as to what's out there or what 
area you want to specialize in this will give   you a good overview of the different options out
