thanks to Capital One shopping for sponsoring a portion of this video we just built a 69 gaming PC that is so blazing fast that it can play everything from CS go to Elden ring sort of all it took was an eBay workstation with a funny name and a lucky GPU score from our friend dude guy Everyman on Craigslist but what if we could give this budget Beauty another boost what new Feats of potency could it reach for a hundred and sixty nine dollars 269 or even four hundred twenty dollars spoiler alert it's gonna get really fast and you're gonna get really surprised what isn't going to surprise you is

PC a gaming PC well it's the GPU obviously right and I mean sure our 30 GTX 760 here will not be outdone in the bang for the buck department and yes it can technically play just about any game even tiny teenage wonderlands but if we want to do better than 720 NEP at the lowest possible settings this guy is going to be the first to go once our lawnmower business starts paying dividends let's look at our contenders then at minimum we want four gigs of frame buffer memory or vram and we've got a hundred dollars to spend before we hit our next price tier that gives us options like the 1660 1650 super 1060 and 970. we ended up going with a GTX 1060. simply because back when we prepared this video RX 580 prices hadn't yet been annihilated by the ethereum merge so I guess I wasted a hundred bucks on this thing and I'm gonna go grab a Radeon RX 580 from the shelf and you should too we went with this dual OC model from Asus but realistically you could go with just about any RX 580 as long as it's not one like this where it's got both an eight pin and a six pin power connector because our power supply only has a single extra Molex and while it does have extra satas and you can get adapters like this to use a card like this one I would not recommend this for minimal risk of fire then stick with the Dual six pin to eight pin adapter and a single 8-pin RX 580 or failing that you could go with a 570 a 480 or 470 or even a 1060 like we had specked out initially tool-less installation that's it let's play some games this my friends is why we wanted four gigs of frame buffer we're at 1080p High which can do maternal is basically like medium well we gaming ladies and gentlemen I mean okay it's not pinned at 60fps but this is absolutely playable any dying that you see Happening Here is because of my lack of skill not because the game is not running well enough okay let's go again where's the bad guys at I'm only on the first level it doesn't this is definitely definitely playable and it doesn't even look it's not like oh yeah we turn in the details way down it looks like absolute hot garbage this looks fine I think this is really impressive but don't take my word for it look at these performance graphs I mean yeah we're spending nearly three times as much on the machine compared to where we started but there are also cases where we're getting nearly three times the performance that is great value for the dollar we are not done no no no I mean what is the point of rocking a brand new to us GPU if it's going to get bottlenecked by our weak CPU the bad news is the locked down bios on our z420 workstation does not support the next generation of Intel Xeon chips codename ivybridge the good news though is that many other boards from that era did support such upgrades so cast off Sandy Bridge chips even really high-end ones are cheap and plentiful the most powerful CPU supported by our mother board then is the E5 2687w in single threaded tasks it might not be much more powerful than our existing E5 1620 but it has double the number of cores double the number of threads and costs a mere 30 on eBay with many of the listings even covering shipping within the continental US score or unfortunately this CPU runs hot enough that HP figured it needed an all-in-one liquid cooler instead of this thing so I guess we'll need to upgrade that too not to an AIO though we've talked a fair bit about how water coolers are not always better than air coolers and this wimpy thing is a prime example meanwhile The Cooler Master hyper 212 Evo supports LGA 2011 and can be had for the very attractive price of about 20 Canadian pesos so at about 15 real dollars to the cost of our CPU another five to ten for some thermal paste and I'm expecting a pretty nice uplift for 50 here what is up with this this is a five pin band connector oh man I love hddt I love hddt cooler installs take our fan pop that on there and now we just gotta plug ah this is a four pin Fan industry standard remember on the motherboard we had that five pin fan header well a quick Google search later you find a post from user silent BOGO on the tech PowerUp forums who tells us that the motherboard header is actually a four pin fan header but just with two ground connectors one on either side of the active pins so our workaround is to take a four pin fan splitter and use that to make it work conveniently you can find these in two packs on Amazon for about five bucks here's a little Tech tip for you we're just gonna pop these pins out then we take our connectors in the exact same order and we're going to put them in on this side all right now we can take our standard fan plug it into here standard four pin connector and we've ripped off our proprietary five pin connector and we can plug that into the board yay really what really you guys now you don't tell me what cooling I need the bad news is that this is not the only ridiculous error that could have you pressing F1 every time you want to boot your computer the good news is that every single one of these errors has a solution that is both inexpensive and can be executed with standard household tools but to show you how many things can cause these sorts of problems let's go ahead and shut the system back off and unplug some stuff let's unplug the ram fan front USB let's take out this one sure and whoops all right let's fire it back up to be clear it's kind of a cool feature actually it's just not the most convenient for you know performing janky upgrades so let's get everything restored to factory the one we can't put back though is this one which presumably is using that fifth pin to sense whether you have a water cooler or not the really frustrating part of this is that if we adopted for the slightly less powerful E5 2690 we probably could have avoided this problem altogether the 2690 is nearly identical to our W workstation chip in every way it's even the same price on eBay but its base clock is 200 megahertz slower and therefore its TDP is only 120 watts instead of the 150 watt monster that we're rocking now thankfully silent vogo chronicled their Journey performing a case transplant on a similar z620 workstation and we were able to adapt some of their findings to help defeat the evil Lord HP bios let's walk through it but first let's walk

description below and start saving money thanks to Capital One shopping for sponsoring that portion of the video let's walk through it silent pogo's post mentioned that pin one on the CPU fan might have been the sensor for a second fan and looking at photos of the official water cooler it certainly appears that that cable goes somewhere instead of just looping back to ground like it does on the stock cooler want to know why because in an air cooled configuration the system is only expecting one fan so that extra pin well that goes to ground no problem but in a water cooled configuration it's expecting two fans so for that reason we actually need to jump that fifth pin to the tack pin which is in the middle we've already done the work I'll turn up the workers sort of mediocreatly done should probably be soldered but this is good enough for us to show you guys that it will work the one thing to be really careful of guys while you're jumping pins between each other on a fan connector is please don't connect your ground to your 12 volt that could start a fire yes yes ignore this extra black lead that's hanging off of here that was from one of the early experiments when we were still trying to figure this out oh my goodness still trying to figure this out ready and with the CPU actually upgraded this time here it comes front chassis fan not detected oh crap the good news is there's a quick and easy solution to this unfortunately it costs 40 dollars why do they even need a special bracket for the fan just put just put mounting holes like everyone else so we're not going to buy that what we are going to do is we're going to buy a two pack of those fan Splitters we showed you guys before which fortunately costs the same for some reason and we're going to make ourselves another little fix by salvaging some fan connector pins from our work earlier shorting pins three and four like this which obviously will protect by putting something over top of them and then shaving off this guide here with a pair of blush Cutters we are able to put without installing another fan which we don't have the bracket for this one here which should allow us once and for all to boot the freaking thing up no F1 here it is the big moment nice okay all I need to do is close up the are you kidding me thing looks like a bloody Tesla it's the heat pipe from the cooler causing the problem thankfully though there's a quick and easy solution speed holes off camera we just put a little bit of like goop like paint or something on the top of the heat pipes then put it on so that it would Mark the spots and then we just parfait less parfait not crap should have put some masking tape on you know what no let's see if we these are not even close dude but wait wait why did I even close this up we're not even done with this stage of the upgrade yet ow currently our system has two sticks of memory in it which means that we're not making proper use of our Xeon processors quad Channel memory controller one way to fix this would be to try to match the ram that's in there with two more sticks but there can be a little bit of trial and error especially on workstation and server boards which tend to be a little bit pickier so we took the easy path and grabbed four matching sticks of ECC DDR3 for about 30 bucks that is less than a dollar per gigabyte oh whoa nice party trick but wait there's more depending how much you spent on your RAM upgrade your budget for this could vary but you should have anywhere between 15 and 30 dollars left to spend on a two and a half gig network card that'll go a long way towards modernizing our system for our high speed Network transfers we're using a card from Trend net which is technically out of our budget but it was lying around in the warehouse well we're connected at two and a half gigabit per second so that's good but because of other system bottlenecks we weren't able to crack around 800 megabit so maybe we can address that later but first let's play around with our two 69 gaming PC oh here's our eight cores and 16 threads by the way pretty sick yeah I know I would say this is running meaningfully better I think it's pretty clear from the FPS counter in the corner that we're not getting way higher frame rates than we were before with our eight core CPU they are significantly more consistent and that's a really good thing because it's making the game feel a lot more you know smoother than the FPS counter would indicate that's awesome great our 99th percentile low frame times are equivalent to over 100 FPS man you want to play some GTA 5. we don't have it cranked or anything but the game is running pretty high we're still pinned at like 120 FPS which yes it's not the city but like damn what's not to like here this is enough performance for 1080p gaming in pretty much any game you'd want to play at 269 dollars absolutely amazing for the price but I want more more what well as I alluded to before I think we could have better storage in this system now that I can play so many games 256 gigs isn't going to be enough to satisfy me and while I could just sell off your my precious GTX 760 and use my 23 to patiently wait for a one terabyte hard drive to show up somewhere I want this PC to be better than that the smart choice is probably a 512 gig or one terabyte two and a half inch SSD like this something like an adata Su 760 is going to give me a dram cache drive for only 50 bucks for 512 or 85 dollars for a terabyte but our next budget tier is 369 dollars and this amount of spare cash has me not really thinking straight here I'm thinking high speed nvme Drive I mean yes this computer predates nvme drives but I don't care I'm flush with cash and throwing caution to the wind problem number one is that modern nvme drives are almost exclusively available in the m.2 form factor and our motherboard has no m.2 slot but I've already kind of given away the solution here you can get cards like this one from Angel bird that allow you to adapt a regular old PCI Express slot to an m.2 slot and the reason that these are so inexpensive is because they're not actually really doing anything see here's all your power pins over here and here's all your data pins over here and they just go right there we have this fancy looking one from Angel bird lying around but there is no reason that you couldn't just use an off-brand one which should run you around 13 then for our drive we picked up the second hand Samsung 970 Evo one terabyte that cost us a hundred and 120 Canadian dineros which is about equivalent to 87 real dollars at the time of filming anyway actually that's probably at the time of calculating it a week ago which uh there we go we're done no or not see that there isn't even a sub menu in the bios for nvme drives but that doesn't mean that the system can't see it if we boot into windows from our SATA drive it actually shows up in device manager as a pcie device it just doesn't show up as a drive so we need to find a workaround thankfully we can take a page from the Hackintosh user's manual so all we need is a USB drive that we don't need anymore one gig or larger doesn't even need to be USB 3 then we're going to put the Clover bootloader on it and allow our system to boot from the flash drive Clover can understand what nvme drives are which means that it can bridge the gap between our system which can boot to USB and clover which can read our nvme drive now we don't really want a USB drive sticking off of our system if we can avoid it so if we want to hide it but also ensure that it stays put we can scrounge up an old front panel USB connection from an old case that maybe somebody's getting rid of plug our drive into one of the many open USB 2 headers on our motherboard okay there it is now we can boot from our Kingston data traveler 3.0 here we go automatic boot in one second uh by the way if you don't want to just leave this hang in here you could use an LTT store cable tie to hold it in place there now it will never move this is immediately noticeably faster it's responsive you know what I mean like let's uh here let's fire up let's fire up steam bring up task manager like this does not feel like a eight-year-old system we're back in game now the performance is very similar to what we had before but that's not the point of fast storage this is the point of fast storage boom I'll Tab out I'm doing stuff I'm using my computer I'll tab well I make sure I hit the right window and I'm back in my game it's the responsiveness that's what makes this feel like a modern new system and not something from eight years ago but we're not done yet we promised you guys a 420 computer didn't we I was told I was getting fifty dollars in RGB lighting and this is what they handed me I guess that's fair enough at this budget that would be a pretty stupid thing to spend another fifty dollars on actually I would probably go the route of adding a little bit more GPU power maybe step up to something like a 5700 or something along those lines but realistically I don't feel like most people are gonna feel like they need to upgrade this thing this is cyberpunk 27 seven running on basically High presets what's our 99th percentile lows here like 37 35 FPS no it's not perfect but there is no question whatsoever that this is playable which means basically you can play any game and at this price point that is quite the accomplishment if you like this video check out the first video where we built the 69 rig or maybe the extended version of it on float plane we included some too hot for our sponsors bits in there
