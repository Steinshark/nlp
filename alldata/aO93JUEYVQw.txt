this channel has just reached a milestone i never could have dreamed of a million people from around the world have subscribed i'm completely humbled by that number i started making these videos four years ago on a channel with a three-digit subscriber account more than 30 videos later this is where we are i thought about just making a generic thank you video to celebrate but i think we can do better so we're going to take a look at the history of the channel i'll give you some behind the scenes looks tell some interesting stories about production and show how we were able to get this far so here it is the quest for 1 million subscribers [Music] you'll notice that the earliest videos on my channel are punch-out speed runs for years that's all my channel really was uploads of my fastest speed runs of the game over the course of many months i accumulated a few dozen subscribers people in the punch-out speedrunning community knew about me but outside of that i was pretty much entirely unknown but by mid-2016 i decided to try experimenting with my channel a bit i began to dabble in video editing uploading videos that explained how glitches work or overlaying a bunch of tyson fights on top of each other at one point there was even a two hour long video where i talked about the record history of the full game but it didn't have any video editing it was basically just me rambling in front of a microphone so it's long been removed but in october of that year i got an idea a fellow punch out speedrunner sinister one had a video on his channel called piston honda 2 strategy evolution it was a recording of a live stream of his from 2013. he looked at a fighter and punch out piston honda 2 and then showed all the world records achieved on him since the late 80s going into detail and explaining the story and strategies behind each one just do this pattern and just kind of go back and forth on them and you get the first six hits for free bam look at that gut face gut face it's an incredibly relaxing and interesting watch unlike my early attempts from back then sinister one knew how to talk in front of a microphone and keep his audience engaged it's still up on youtube today and i'd highly recommend watching if you have some time to sit back and unwind there's a link to it in the description this video of his had stuck out in my mind ever since i saw it years prior i mean i found it absolutely fascinating to learn about the record history of a speedrun like that and i thought it could be fun to make one too but instead of doing a live stream and taking nearly two hours maybe i could use video editing condense it down to under 20 minutes so i taught myself how to edit used my iphone as a microphone which didn't sound too great and released my first video mike tyson world record progression and at that point this is what my channel looked like the video ended up only getting a few thousand views but i only had about 600 subscribers at that point if you're one of those 600 then sorry my channel has changed so much but what got me really excited about this video was the feedback everyone was telling me they loved the concept and the way it was edited it was certainly encouraging to hear so i worked really hard and a week and a half later in january 2017 i uploaded another one this time on the original super mario brothers darby and watched it on his stream with a few hundred viewers and it was also posted on reddit and it quickly was obvious that i had a big video on my hands my subscriber count doubled overnight and a few days later it doubled again it was pretty clear that i should keep making these so for the rest of 2017 and into the next year that's what i did the outpouring of support from new fans was just remarkable those of you who have been around for that long have been so supportive and you really encouraged me to keep going it made me excited to see what the response would be for every new video i uploaded that being said i look back on a lot of these early videos with mixed feelings after initially covering games that i speed ran myself i eventually had to get into games i knew much less about and in all honesty i didn't do anywhere near the amount of research i needed to do for many of these videos i would just ask a few questions to some high level runners then build off of that most of these videos don't go into nearly enough detail and many contain misinformation i've never even played pokemon before and i've played zelda 1 for maybe 5 minutes total yet ended up putting out a video for both of them without enough research as a result i was sometimes able to release multiple videos in a month usually 15 or 20 minutes in length that warrants of the quality i'd want nowadays people often ask me if i'll ever update any of my old videos since the records have gotten lower but what i'll likely start doing soon is redoing them i should be able to raise the quality of information quite a bit as well as talk about new records and discovery since the last video it's also been suggested that i have one mega update video where i talk about what's happened since from multiple different videos but i think a video like that would be missing the context and story that i want i am more of a speedrunning historian channel not a speedrunning news channel but even though i'm not thrilled with some of my older videos the support from all of you was there and by the end of 2017 the channel had surpassed a hundred thousand subscribers in 2018 i started to slow down production a bit and really focus on research and i feel the quality of the videos started to improve i began editing with sony vegas got a higher quality microphone and in mid 2018 i feel i was really able to upgrade the quality of my videos i began using home's song we're finally landing which has become synonymous with my channel and during this time some very memorable videos were created like sonic adventure 2 battle there's this running theme where often when i upload a video it becomes obsolete right away with a new world record there's been times when someone has beaten the record just days after i uploaded but this video takes the cake because dage 4 beat his own record to make my video outdated just 2 hours after my video was released 2 hours most people hadn't even watched it yet mario kart wii was one of the craziest experiences i've ever had on youtube this video struck a groove in the youtube algorithm and exploded with three and a half million views in the first two weeks to this day i've never had another video do what that one did and i'm not sure if i ever will 2018 ended up being the biggest year ever for the channel i gained over 300 000 subscribers putting the total at just under half a million in general i do make a lot of videos on the mario kart franchise and i know this has a mixed reaction some people love them while others aren't a fan and wish i'd diversify a bit more ultimately i've been drawn to these for two reasons one they're some of my favorite speedruns and i know a lot about them and two they have a lot of visually interesting shortcuts and tricks mario kart 64 and mario kart wii in particular often my videos turn out better when it's on a topic i'm interested in and unfamiliar with that's why i've made just one video on zelda and pokemon but many on mario kart i'll never make more than one or maybe two mario kart videos in a year and as i cover more topics they're certainly going to be harder to come by but they're still going to happen from time to time in 2019 i really started to refine my research process one of my most in-depth videos ever was on castlevania i've played and beaten the game before but was only vaguely familiar with the speedrun so i had to create a massive list of world records as this timeline wasn't fully known before my research began and thanks to help from members in the community i put together a set of notes for each record along with splits for where they lost in game time this is why my videos often end up taking months to make i have to do this level of research for most of my videos now and it often ends up taking over a dozen pages and of course i have to give a lot of credit to those who help me with this whether it be former record holders or just knowledgeable community members nearly everyone i reach out to is willing to help me get the info i need and these videos wouldn't be possible without them but my favorite part of the whole process has to be the video editing the quest to beat matt turk my first video of 2020 is one of my favorites in that regard i spend a lot of time trying to approach these stories from the most interesting angles possible and this video is no exception being able to tell the history of sinister one and zalard one taking down matt turk's 14 incredible records was so much fun i watched these guys set many of these records live back in the day and for years the legend of matt turk was only really known about in the punch-out community what what what i'm really glad i was able to tell this story to so many people 2020 in general had some of my favorite videos wii sports resort golf ended up being an unlikely success with a really fun story and memorable characters that community was incredibly helpful and encouraging when i approached them with the idea so shout outs to them and of course the quest for world record perfection with matthias and the a1a was a lot of fun too videos usually fall somewhere between being heavily strategy and tech based to being heavily story based this video definitely falls deep into the story based side of things there wasn't much to talk about in the way of strategy but the story of matthias getting 31 out of 32 8 times practically wrote itself having made more than 30 of these videos now i've seen some incredible pockets of the speedrunning community you've got arcus setting 16 ninja gaiden world records in a row yes it is a new record perfect boss fight abny driving into a wall 26 000 times to set an unthinkable world record there are people from all sorts of different backgrounds with all different life stories coming together to set world records and have friendly competition i'm really proud to be documenting this but it brings me so much joy to read through all these comments hear about the people who drop everything to watch these right when they come out people who use them to get to sleep at night or people who have movie nights with friends whenever there's a new video i really stumbled into this by accident just trying to come up with ideas for an enjoyable video and now four years later thanks to all of you we made it to a million it's hard to say what the future holds possibly even taking this beyond youtube but i'm planning to keep making these videos for years to come thanks to all of you and thank you for watching
