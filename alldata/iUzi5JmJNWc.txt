Craigslist a hundred dollars to come in and take surveys. They have no idea but me and a hundred other
zombies are gonna storm the room and scare them. All right. So we're
gonna be hiding back here and the rest are gonna
storm through the door. - Oh my God! - Oh my God. - That was a good reaction. - I don't wanna look. - High five. Just one quick high five. - I'm sorry.
- It's just a prank. You're good. How do you feel right now? What was the scariest part? Hi, how are you? - Oh my God. What the . - Are you okay?
- No. Oh my gosh. You guys scared the out of me. - We're gonna be hiding
under these tables. Next, we're gonna be sitting
at the tables, taking surveys, and then we're all gonna pop
up and see how they react. - My God. I told you, we're gonna wait four hours, have this. - We just need you to
write how scared you were. That was all.

and scare some people. - Is it safe to go by these guys. - Yes, sir. - Are you gonna cannibalize me or what? - We just did our first destination. Now we're onto the next one. When you watch T-Series,

was like, "Who's that?" What's up, man? - Oh, nice . - Hey, Chris, what are you gonna order? - I can't eat anything. I don't have a jaw. So I'm just gonna drink a drink. Can I get two fingers and a toe? - I'm gonna get a drink.

exterminate the other zombies. He had the Nerf guns. Let's do it. Hey, doctor. Those are the potions you told us about? It's not working. Why is it not working? - In order for the potions to work, you have to kill all the

us to the desert, man. - Why are we going to the desert? - 'Cause zombies don't
survive in the desert. - Hey, guys. Thank you so much for helping us out today for being zombies. Everybody here is gonna get
paid a good amount of money, like $200. So thank you so much.
