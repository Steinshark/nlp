if you want the answer uh yeah i could give the money back it is within my power um but i'm gonna look out for myself and not do that i i you know i don't like know what else to say that's just the most honest answer [Music] yo yo what's up what's up hey man hey yeah i wanted to call because uh i know we've talked about cx coin before and you said hey let let you know if anything's suspicious and uh things are looking mad suspicious it looks like the coin got rugged you know anything about that i mean yeah i mean not rugged but uh i mean well someone pulled all the liquidity out that's a that's a rub right that would be a rug yes uh but there is still liquidity in there what like a yeah i mean the majority got ripped out right what 40k got left and 300k got ripped out or something like that yeah i mean that is exactly what happened right are you laughing i mean is that funny um i mean no okay but right so do you want to tell me what happened or yeah i mean it's uh pretty simple basically the coin was inactive for a long time the crypto market is crashing and obviously i'm not gonna let three hundred thousand dollars go to waste and crumble into nothing if bnb goes to 50 so i took out what wasn't necessary in the liquidity based on the trade volume and i left enough in there for people to buy or sell or whatever they want to do wait what do you mean go to waste like that's how people get out right like liquidity is how people get out if you rip 300k out that's 300k that people can't get out right but there's 42k in the liquidity right now so that is i mean that's literally nothing i mean there's not much money invested into the coin at this point right but you understand like you called this thing a long-term project from the get-go right you told everybody it wasn't a scam you had these videos where you said you were joking where you said you'd scam people as soon as you thought the money was going to be basically taken away you were going to rip it out from under everybody uh and then you i asked you about it you said it's a you were joking it doesn't seem like a joke anymore it seems like you scammed your fans uh no not a not a scam um you don't think we're drawing 300k is is a scam like at the time the project needs it the most um i mean no i don't think so it's uh there's no trade volume on the coin bro it's inactive you know i didn't want to do the coin anymore well the uh well people were waiting for like you to do i mean really deliver on the like you know marketing that the marketing wallet nobody knows what happened with that um because you were promising to get influencers on board people were basically waiting to deliver i think it was inactive because there wasn't a lot of um like i mean you basically hyped up this coin you took a bunch of people's money to invest and then you know i mean you're just like taking the money as soon as the coin dies down for a bit uh well i'll put it this way so when i release the coin obviously i have i had good intentions with it um there was a lot of [ __ ] that happened when i released the coin you know twitter got banned all this different stuff the coin dumped and obviously everyone said it was scam and all this stuff influencers aren't going to want to work with that for one and for two it already had so much bad publicity and seo that it just was uh it just wasn't gonna work with the visions that i had right so at that case your first impulse is to just grab for the money that's still there i mean i wouldn't say that's my first impulse but well it's basically as soon as the liquidity got unlocked that's what you did right so i mean what's the alternative the alternative is at minimum people can try to get their money back right because that's that's not your money that's people's investment who believed in you and you said as a long-term project you're going to be working on it for years to come whatever and then you do the opposite i don't know how this could like how you could not see this as a total scam this this was a scam you said something it wasn't delivered and you took the money that's a scam you know well i used the uh we made the platform i used it people weren't donating with it um i don't really know like like obviously it just wasn't working out so it's not a scam i tried but it just didn't work out and it already had so much bad publicity on it that i just didn't want anything to do with it anymore the coin was a fork of another coin the integration got hacked day one i mean the platform really didn't work and then people weren't you weren't pushing using the marketing wallet it it this wasn't i mean if you're saying you tried it you know you didn't like this wasn't this wasn't a very hard try i've been looking through your telegram the telegram's been inactive you've been inactive from the telegram is what i mean it's not like the community has seen you around seeing you trying and they gave up they stopped you stopped trying they stopped caring because you stopped trying and then you withdrew all the money while the people who are still investing holding on are still believing that like you're gonna come back and basically save them with updates and stuff like that uh i mean why that's like seems really messed up i mean like i said the coin had so much bad publicity that no influencers are gonna work with it and it was very stressful but it had bad publicity because you were on the record saying that you were gonna take everyone's money and run then you said that wasn't true and then now you've taken everyone everyone's money and run because you said oh it had bad bad publicity but that bad publicity was from you and then you carried through on what you said yeah i mean mistakes were made and i was joking about that when i said that but at this point like i said the coin isn't active uh i don't want to work on it anymore because it's just you know too it's just too like it just wasn't working out i don't know i don't know what you mean by inactive though because you are you are like the team that's creating it if you stopped working on it it's inactive but if you didn't stop working on it then it's not inactive i don't know what you mean yeah cause i've been working on it for months that's what i mean you haven't been working on it no right so so your justification for pulling all the money out is you stopped working on it so then that's what makes it okay for you to take the money well uh okay so i didn't want to work on the coin anymore so the alternative is to just leave three hundred thousand dollars no the alternative is tell the your community you're not working on the coin anymore it was a big mistake pull your money out guys i mean i thought that was self-explanatory when i haven't been active for months with it you thought it was self-explanatory but you didn't say it so you really think that if you told everyone hey guys this is a failed project i'm not doing it anymore people would have just left that money there you literally think the money would have just been burned it would have gone to nobody you don't think you could have tried to get get people's money back like i said there's forty two thousand dollars in the liquidity still there's not a lot of money involved three hundred thousand i mean if we do the math you took out almost ninety percent of the liquidity so you took out ninety percent of the money right um why not try to give that back to your fans who invested they still have the ability to sell they can get money they know there's forty thousand dollars left to split between all of them i'm saying you took out three hundred thousand dollars why not give that back to your fan to your fans the people who invested in this well you already invested you only invested 50k you told me so why not just give look you've already been paid you've already been made whole you didn't deliver on the platform you didn't do what you said you were going to do you said you got bored with the platform i guess fi like if if that's your thing you just made a big mistake give the money back you've been made whole no one's hurt the way i see it though you've taken 250k that really doesn't belong to you i mean i guess that's one way to put it um i think of it the way to put it sure okay um i think you haven't done anything you haven't you haven't created any value you just made empty promises that you didn't deliver on you said you got bored and then you dipped out of the project and said you thought it was self-explanatory i'll put it this way if i invest into a coin and it's not active for months i'm gonna just sell what i bought because why would i hold money in there if it's not active for months that's what i mean by self-explanatory so you think people just should have known that they shouldn't at a certain point they just shouldn't give you the benefit of the doubt they should just basically take their money and run uh if deadlines aren't met yeah that's base that's like the responsibility of the investor so they were dumb to give you the benefit of the doubt uh your your fans were not smart to give you the benefit of the doubt on this project that you told them you're long term on uh no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying that if something's inactive for months if you have money in there that you don't want to lose why are you like why keep it in there it's inactive it's it's you know what i mean well dude i mean people are taking you at your word they're taking you at what you said you said um you know this is long term right this is you in the telegram this is thanks guys i assume everyone here is in it for the long haul to see this project come to life yeah anyone who invests in this should know it's a long-term project so one week is not going to see results you're the one saying people should not be looking for short-term gains they should be looking at it and like a long-term project right yeah okay i said that i said that stuff when i was working on it and then it just wasn't working out so i mean it didn't work out because you stopped working on it paul yeah i i i told you the it just the the you're saying you stopped because you it stopped working out but no you stopped first and then you said it was inactive then you took the money and ran uh okay hold on no you that's not you i mean sure the way you're putting it is not false but you make it sound uh like i had ill intentions from the beginning which wasn't the case i tried to use it no listen there was a ton of glitches with it there was people not donating using it uh there was bad publicity so no influencer was going to work with it no matter how much money was in the marketing wallet and it added a lot of stress into me uh you know and everyone's you know like uh i have a lot of stuff on my shoulders with that and i just didn't want to deal with distress i didn't want to deal with it so i stopped working on it listen all of that maybe let's just say maybe we can understand that you are a little too uh ambitious you couldn't do it you're saying i was in over my head i i get that i get i was in over my head i thought this would be an easy thing i thought i was really excited about it and then i wasn't all of that i wouldn't have called you i'm calling you because then after deciding that you couldn't deliver you gave up you decided to abandon people then you took the money that's what looks bad here is that you took the money you're not apparently you have no plans to give it back which is just like blowing my mind right now okay right you understand that you messed up you failed and you're taking other people's money who trusted you that's why it looks bad that's why it's a scam i mean if that's what you want if that's how you want to label it then sure i mean how would you how would you label it somebody makes a bunch of promises they don't go through with it they don't notify the community and then they rug pool the liquidity 90 of the liquidity what would you call that uh i would call it pretty logical logical i mean i'll put it this way the stock mark or not the stock market the crypto market is crashing and the 300 000 is in there there's two options right leave the money in there and then if bnb goes down it's like a hundred dollars the money goes to [ __ ] anyways or i could take it and the money is not just going to dust money would have never gone to dust i mean it just would go back to the investors when they sold out when you told them hey guys i'm no longer interested in this project i wipe my hands of it you know you got your 50k in you got your 50k out you're good right you didn't deliver this is not your money i can't believe you keep thinking of it as like as your money that's going away that's your investor's money and it should be their decision what they do with it okay i mean that's fair point well that's not what happened so that's what i'm saying when somebody who's made a bunch of promises didn't deliver misappropriates those funds that's what we call a scam you're pointing to these crypto markets whatever that's a scam so i mean here's where it's at like obviously uh you know this is this is something i'm definitely gonna cover but i'd prefer it if there could be some positive into this where you actually return the money to the investors so they can take their money out that's my ideal goal and i want to see if you here today can just put that money back in i know you have it you know you have it um put the money back in the liquidity pool so that people can sell and take their money back they can sell how much money do you think is invested into the coin what by who by people who are holding it no no no no no here's the thing i'm saying you took out 300 000 why not put that money back in so people can sell because they can already still sell there's only 40 i mean you rip the liquidity pool apart yeah but there's enough money in there or people who have any amounts of money to get out forty thousand sure doesn't seem like a lot but there's not a lot of money invested into the coin so there's enough for people to sell their portion that doesn't even make sense how does that all make sense okay okay here's the thing don't pretend like you don't understand how liquidity pools work when you take them out okay then why are you acting obtuse like you took out three hundred thousand dollars if other people had withdrawn all their money that three hundred thousand dollars who wouldn't be there would it if even if what you're saying is let's just say what you're saying is true which is forty thousand dollars is enough put your money back in they'll all withdraw there will still be that three hundred thousand dollars for you if what you're saying is true and then you can take it back out how about you put it in there announce to everybody that hey i gave up on this project sell everything you can take your money out and then whatever's left if you're if what you're saying is true and you know what people there everyone can be made whole by this magical accounting then you can have that 300 000 that uh was left over but you know that's not true so that's why you're hesitant to do it well yeah i mean i don't want to do that obviously oh you want so you do you so you want to keep the money that's not yours that you took from the project even though you'd failed to deliver i mean i'm not really sure what you want me to say but yeah i mean i don't really like what you want to say i just want you to admit it's a scam uh from the start i did not have ill intentions but you got ill intentions okay hold on at this point there are sometimes you come across places in your life and you have to scale something right and sometimes you have to look out for yourself more than other people wow and you know that's one of these situations and i mean i don't really know how else to put it it's if i i think of it like this if somebody is still holding money into a coin that's not active for seven months six months however long it's the responsibility they're like part of the responsibility is on them as well for being you know like putting too much emotion into it okay you still didn't answer my answer what i said which is you said what do you want i said i want you to admit this was a scam just i i can tell you're having trouble saying it because you are at odds with what you did and what you think of yourself but just tell me just just be honest you scammed people whether or not you meant to do it now you have scammed people officially and you refuse to give their money back i'm it's i'm not going to say it was a scam because that's just uh that wasn't the intention from the beginning but it eventually was the intention is what i'm saying my intention is to not [ __ ] people over but like i said there comes certain points there comes certain points in your life where you have to look out for yourself and weigh the options right and what did the option say and what did the options say uh the options say leave the money in there or take the some of the money like i don't know like or tell or tell the investors as the leader of this project that you are no longer working on it and take their money out while they still can i mean they still can sure not everyone would be able to sell but there's not a lot of money invested into the coin i think more i think some of the i think one of the top wallet holders has like 4b can you tell me how much money you made off this um this what i'm i'll just call it a scam i know you don't want to call it a scam but it is a scam so what did you make of this well i got 55 and then 45 percent went to uh my developers so i probably i mean i'm trying to think i don't know probably like 300 000 nice what what a good what a good profit from doing um i mean how long did you work on this project like seriously how long did you work i'm just curious well like you said it was a fork so a couple weeks couple weeks three hundred thousand dollars that's that's a good uh it's a nice chunk of change what do you plan to do with the money uh invest into crypto ethereum mainly okay cool well uh all right i guess that's basically all the questions i i don't i don't want to run in circles about you i i can't believe you won't just admit it was a scam but i think um that's basically all the questions i had i'll be reporting on this probably soon um just and uh i i don't know did you want to say anything else i mean there's not really much else to say i've told you what what my thought process is um you know at the end at the end of the day there comes points where you have to look out for yourself and i think that it's also some of the responsibility falls on the people that are still for getting scammed yes i agree they should have known not to trust influencer promises i agree with that you and i agree on that [Music] yeah i don't trust influencer promises i was more saying when something is an inactive you sell that's bad no one knew it was inactive right like dude i didn't talk in the telegram i didn't do anything with the coin for months right i mean right any logical person would know that the project isn't active i've invested in plenty of bsc coins and as soon as something's not active anymore i sell because that's you know the nature of being constantly that it's a long-term project you're working on on the uh platform right people just assumed you had got done what you should have been doing which is coding working on the project hiring developers working behind the scenes projects do that all the time where the team is you don't have to constantly be in there but they're constantly working on new updates pushing new things right you worked on it for a few weeks told everyone it was a long-term project told everyone you were working on it made some half-assed attempt to get a website up and then gave up waited to your liquidity unlocked rugged the coin while ghosting everybody and then now you're just saying well gotta look out for number one like you know get scammed i guess like i guess that's the message here i mean would you prefer that i lied to you or do you want me to no i want i want you to no i'm happy you're telling me the truth um you know uh but i think it's messed up like i can be grateful that you're honest while also being like shocked and appalled that like you're so brazen about this you know like it's both things are true well i mean this is terrible this is terrible and it's also emblematic of a wider attitude of influencers towards their fans where they really don't care about their fans and simultaneously like are like fine with ripping people off while also i think probably being i don't know if you're aware of the fact that your average fan has way less money than you so you're just taking from poor people like you understand that right that is definitely not that that is not a good way to put it that's a pretty shitty way to put it my dude it's i think it's a pretty shitty thing to do sure i mean i can agree taking out liquidity is definitely not ethical but like i said when there you know you sometimes you have to look out for yourself and i think by this point if somebody hasn't used logical reasoning to determine whether or not they should sell by this point some of the responsibility also falls on them again again i what are you saying like i i don't disagree with you that like trusting influencers is always a mistake right empty influencer promises right like i i agree with you that's a problem but if you're trying to say they made a mistake so it makes the shitty thing that i did okay like it's like it's insane like that's crazy and and you're you just said like yeah like it's like taking for poor people yeah it is that's what that's literally what it is your average viewer has way less money than you and you took their money and your only explanation is well they were too dumb to realize how these projects work so they deserve it i get i don't know if you're trying to say they deserve it you're saying they don't owe some responsibility i agree with some responsibility but do they deserve to get ripped off no i mean nobody deserves that it's just not happen though like i said sometimes you have to look out for yourself uh i don't really know how else you want me to put it i mean if you i mean you could say it in all these different ways to make it sound as horrible as possible and you know what i can agree with you on some of those things i just don't like to put it in those specific ways because it makes it sound like that was the intention from the start which it wasn't uh but at this point the project's dead there's three hundred thousand dollars you know what i mean might as well be yours right i mean sure yeah you took it um well i mean for you i don't expect this will matter much you can just lay low ride the 300 000 out and you'll be fine um i i hope i could say the same thing about whoever put the money into this project um yeah it's like all the negatives we you guys say all the negatives maybe say some of the positives too when the coin release there was scam coins or like you know like coins that were uh had the same name as my coin and people who bought those i gave them money i probably gave people i don't even know maybe 30 40 000 my own money to people who bought fake projects or if somebody uh dm'd me and said they put like a couple thousand in you know i gave them like maybe 30 of it back like you know i was doing things to try to help people out but at a certain point you can't help people out so if you're going to say all the negatives when you have 300 000 you by definition can still help people out right like again i'm not telling you you have to lose money on your project i'm saying just give back everything else and you're saying no you still want to profit from a project you self-admit you did the minimum amount of work on got bored gave up but you still want to basically pocket the money and just say like yeah well they it was their fault for basically trusting me anyways we're we're running in circles um you're saying like i'm putting this in bad ways uh i i think it's shitty so i mean i'm just trying to recap i just can't believe that nothing in this is like sparking a response that makes you feel bad that makes would make you want to return this money um because it's very much within your power to do so and you and i both know that so i don't know why you're acting like it has to end with like you being the bad guy here that's not what i'm trying to do at all i'm trying to like get you to return the money because it's 100 still available and you could do that so that's what i'm not understanding is i want to get to that point i don't think we're going to get there um so i don't know what there is to talk about if you want the answer uh yeah i could give the money back it is within my power um but i'm gonna look out for myself and not do that i i you know i don't like know what else to say that's just the most honest answer do you think the uh fbi should get involved with cases like this or like the sec or do you think like people like you should be prosecuted um no why not i mean i'm just saying crypto's very unregulated right now uh but fraud is still a crime i'm just asking you i'm not saying you're guilty of anything i'm not accusing you of that i'm just asking what do you think should happen to people who scam or take money or uh you know take people's money from a project that they didn't do much what do you think should happen to them um well i mean if they just rug pull from the beginning then yeah that would be really extra shitty and they should probably face some kind of repercussions do you think like like uh civil or like criminal well since it's unregulated i suppose civil so people have gone to jail for crypto i mean that it's it still can be prosecuted as fraud so it's it's actually like more of the like the the um like whether it's a security that's not very well understood um but you can still you can still commit crimes with crypto obviously everybody knows that um but i guess i guess what you're saying is that as long as you wait like a few months before you rug pull then you're good i'm saying that i gave it a try it was too stressful i didn't want to do it it was getting too much you know [ __ ] on it and uh you know nobody was the platform was scuffed and people weren't using it people were finding glitches in it and i just didn't want to deal with it and that's really your last your last post in the in the telegram was on the 30th of july when did it launch uh june and when in june do you know so you tried for like two months or like like a couple weeks yeah you can see whether or not a project's going to do well within a couple weeks based on the attitude of everyone in the you know in the project okay so you had good intentions for a couple weeks okay i had good intentions for a while i had personal stuff going on shortly after that happened where i had to take time off streaming and and then i just didn't want to deal with the stress of it i mean i don't really know what you're like wanting me to say i don't know what you like what do you want from me you know what i mean like i'm telling you i want you to return the money but i i think you're just i think you're pretty determined on that huh determined on what i i said i want you to return the money but i guess you're pretty determined not to i mean there's risk involved with with everything right well this isn't a matter of risk this is just a matter of you making a decision to do the right thing right this is an ethical problem and i agree and i agree that it's not a good move uh in terms of ethics but sometimes you have to look out for yourself okay all right i think that's all i can uh would you rather be honest or would you rather me sit here and [ __ ] you and get nowhere i mean i'd rather you return the money that's my ideal second is i'd rather you be honest and third yeah bullshitting's the worst so we're i guess we're somewhere in the middle here but anyways i did i did at the beginning help people get money back but like i said at a certain point when it becomes like at a certain point it you know some of the responsibility is on them and i did feel bad don't try to justify this this is insane you can't try to justify this you know it's wrong you're deciding to do the unethical thing i'm trying to code it don't try to code it in some like i tried you didn't try right you you decided to do the unethical thing you're doubling down don't try to code it in some like oh i don't know it's like the responsibility you are deciding to do the shitty thing you know that and you're still doubling down and that's where we're like we're going to have to leave it yeah i am doubling down do you not do you not agree though some of the responsibility is on people who if you're still holding something that's inactive for months like sure okay maybe they you know have faith in me whatever but that's not a good that's your fans dude that's your fans these are people who followed you since they were kids they admire you they look up to you that's the people you're saying well that's their fault like loser gets scammed okay first of all the coin was a very niche part of my community i didn't really advertise it to my entire whole community i advertise it to a niche part that understands crypto again i can't i can't deal with look i can deal with you being honest i can't deal with like the like trying to justify what you i prefer like the honesty of like yeah i just you know you're saying that i'm trying to scam my entire fan base that's not true uh there was i said your fans are the buyers i didn't say your entire fan base i said your fans are the ones who are holding the coin so it's the die hard fans of your community and my fans and crypto people yes well i yeah like i said that that's all that's all really uh there is i guess um thanks for being i i do appreciate you being honest i do believe you're extremely honest here um and i do believe this is yeah one of the one of the shittiest things i've seen in a while uh okay all right that's it thanks man all right bye later bye
