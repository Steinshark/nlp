ladies and gentlemen welcome back this is the series return of how to win at chess this Series has been going on for nearly 30 episodes I do believe this is now episode 26 and in this series I basically just play against subscribers of mine who volunteer we play rapid games of Chess and we go up the rating ladder I walk you through every phase of the game and then I analyze the game when it is done the series is so iconic that I even named my chess book after it how to win a chess this one is also called The Ultimate Guide for beginners and Beyond it's been a while since we recorded an episode and all the craziness and drama of the Chess World and other types of content uh but we're back today and we are better than ever and I'm very very excited let's just jump into the games um I really enjoy the series because it's very laidback uh I can sit here and tell me please by the way if it's not episode 26 like if I left something out of the playlist somewhere uh and there's just an episode floating around please let me know we're going to kick things off today uh with a match up against an 880 rated subscriber and then we are going to be moving up the ranks uh up until about 2100 so I think I'm playing 800 1100 147 and then 2100 my opponent plays D4 I would imagine that uh a a London is coming let me play a Dutch defense you may be surprised but the Dutch defense is actually shockingly effective at beginner level and that's because if you look at the online databases the chance of you getting a move or rather a position that you have studied in the Dutch defense is very high and that's what opening preparation is all about it's about getting the positions that you've practiced over and over again so my opponent plays the London you know it's very common at this level that you're going to face London so I'm going to play Knight to F6 and then we're going to develop nothing special or spectacular yet I guess I need to choose which setup I'm going to go for uh I'm going to play a Leningrad Dutch defense with Knight F6 G6 and Bishop G7 for white the most aggressive way to play here is to actually launch this H Pawn targeting my G Pawn which is known as a hook a hook is a pawn in front of a a king that can be used for your opponent to kind of knock into but hopefully my opponent is just sort of playing typical pre-moving London you know player kind of mentality just putting the knights out and the pieces out and I don't blame anybody who plays like this of course London is one of the easiest openings to play and kind of repeat over and over but that's what a hook would be and this is a good example of how to use one now admittedly my opponent hasn't actually castled so this this thing still exists now because the lenrad is set up in this kind of a formation black fights for the E4 square but a key idea of this opening is is to potentially put this Pawn on E5 which is what I'm going to prepare and I'm going to do that likely by rotating my knight to H5 and then targeting this bishop and playing the move E5 there are also some tricks that you can play right now with the move E5 for example Pawn takes Pawn takes and then your queen actually attacks this bishop now here what a person might calculate is as follows E5 Pawn takes Pawn takes Knight takes Knight takes takes Bishop takes and then Queen takes bishop and you say oh E5 is the best move but that would be a mistake because you only calculated what you wanted to see whereas your opponent would play Take Take and then move the bishop to C4 which is a check aich in between move and then they would take your Pawn so before you just go like this and start chopping everything down you need to look at moves for your opponent in any short burst of calculation that put you under maximum danger that was the instructive moment there all right the instructive moment was I can prove myself right I can show a sequence of moves where I get the thing I get the thing that I wanted you know and and then it works and I'm happy but as you get better at chest you're going to pick up on these little details and you're not always just going to rush into situations thinking you know I I uh I'm absolutely certain this is going to work blah blah blah so B4 is interesting when this Pawn comes up here the idea I would like to think is to Target my knight um anytime a pawn moves you got to think about what's getting weaker as well that got weaker it's tough to exploit though now I have the option to take the bishop right away and then play E5 oops and then play E5 or I can just play E5 uh I think you know again I'm not going to play like like 2440 but I'm going to kind of play Simple chess which is I wanted to take the bishop and now I'd like to play E5 and we're going to have an interesting position so my opponent is just playing very very fast all right so I'm going to obviously take back they cannot take they have to realize this is pinned they could check me now I just told you ah yeah they missed that they they were calculating this but they forgot that my queen can open up and see their Bishop playing a little bit too fast a little bit too fast for a 10-minute game I get it you're playing me but in general you got to be really careful uh opening the position like this anytime you're opening up something you got to think about what your opponent can now see which they couldn't in the previous position uh and the difference there of the move of Bishop C4 check in like this position or this position would just be in the version I showed you I was losing a pawn so in this version I was losing a pawn in the center and allowing that check but now I'm not so now I have the option I can take on E5 or I can take on C3 the truth is very tough to decide right now which of these two moves is better I will tell you I think I'm going to take this Pawn because it feels like this Pawn's not going anywhere and now I'm I'm targeting that pawn three different ways so it feels like I grabbed that other pawn and now I'm going to take on C3 yeah my opponent attacks my knight but this was always my idea and so now we're sort of cleaning up uh yeah I I mean I feel just my opponent played a little bit too fast this game now me personally I would always bring the queen back here I always like to say going forward in chess is like eight or nine times out of 10 going to be better than going backward I just don't want to leave my King open so let me get my queen out of any Harm's Way there not B4 and so now I'm up uh a bishop and I'm up a pawn and the game plan here can be let's trade the Queens let's trade the Rooks let's trade pawns and let's just win the end game because Without a Queen my opponent's never going to mate me so a good way to do that with my knight under attack is to play Queen D4 of course I could have played Queen F6 Queen F4 Queen E4 Queen C5 Queen I could have played any queen move what my opponent should probably do is this although that move does run into a little bit of a problem it's a very good idea it's a very sneaky move it's just so happens that I have a defensive move which is an offensive move which would have been putting the bishop there uh but uh yeah this of course just benefits me now with mil Queens on the board the chance of me losing uh is much lower and that's nice uh Knight to A5 okay that doesn't quite have a threat a lot of you would be tempted to play the move B6 here is why it's bad it allows the knight in very common beginner mistake attacking a knight with a pawn losing control of a square and now all of a sudden the Knight is attacking the bishop now fortunately you know I can just slide back and I'm fine but there will be positions where you are not fine and the next order of business for anybody watching should be there to Target the Knight or A6 to get rid of the pawn and to open up the Rook I'm always looking I'm always looking how can my opponent attack me that's another thing you it's always got to be running in the back of your mind how can my opponent put me under pressure in this position right but that's my idea right now I think I'm going to play Bishop B7 I don't really think it matters to be honest the best option for my opponent would probably be to just run around with the Knight I don't think you should allow me to trade but if you do the pawn does get a little closer it is two squares from queening uh if I'm not careful yeah I'm not even going to think I'm going to absolutely take and now I'm going to put my Rook on the open file forgetting that I could have went up and taking and that would have been the best I should go up and take that's what I should do but uh now anytime you got a situation like this the question becomes do I take or do I ignore um a lot of you would take you would because you would just you know you take it but now you invite The Rook in so now I would probably just come come back here and everything defends everything this is very nice white has no counterplay in this position which does make life a lot easier and the best way to win this position put the Rooks on the open line and get down to the opponent's second rank you got to put the Rooks on the second rank you could do this and this as well you could take a little pit stop if you're uncomfortable take that pawn just so it never does anything not necessary but I can see you know I first of all I can see people forgetting about that pawn but I can also see people targeting it right away cuz you're a little bit worried you don't you know you don't want to yeah and so now of course we trade still we should put the Rook on the second rank but I'm following the philosophy of just trading the pieces we have no back rank Checkmate our King is always going to be safe don't worry about checks and now the easiest thing is you can just go the E by far the easiest is to put the Rook behind the pawn that's also a free Pawn but I'm 800 I don't know that and I'm also not playing this in the most accurate way uh and and uh you know A3 I'm just pushing I don't want excuse me I don't want to flank defend I really don't want to defend my Pawn from the side like I would rather defend it from behind like this but I can't right so when my opponent plays Rook A1 I'm going to play Rook C2 now a lot of you you actually don't have to even take this you can play Bishop here very common idea securing the promotion and deflecting but you know I'm around this level so let me just take back it's it's okay to do that you could be as clean as possible and now the easiest is Bishop there but let's just say you know again I'm 900 I'm trying to deflect The Rook I'm not you know I don't want okay my opponent gives me a check a lot of you would hide for cover in the corner you could accidentally get checkmated you see my opponent's kind of running now uh there is this move though and that that that'll that'll do it that is a pawn capture and that is a fork and I will win the rook and then I will make the queen just don't stal meate now if you're playing white here you never resign my opponent resigns cuz they're respecting my skill and I appreciate that but never ever ever resign in this position so really what went wrong here is it was a ddge by me right and I played I I played my idea I played you know night Knight here uh and then I played like this a small inaccuracy by my opponent was was playing B4 you generally don't want to mess with the Pyramid of the London I would recommend instead maybe sliding back and trying to play for E4 but this just shows you how how strong and kind of you know resilient and Powerful the Dutch defense is even at this level it's uh it's a very tough opening to crack and it's particularly good against the London which because you try to play this move that makes your London opponent uncomfortable my opponent made the mistake of opening up the position and forgetting that I had a piece there and then from there it was sort of cleanup right like I needed to clean up I thought I traded correctly showed you how to like allow counterplay and how not to allow counterplay overall a pretty smooth game right simplified didn't allow counterplay uh and that was um that was how we won that position but you got to be very careful every time pawns are opening up on the board games are won and lost with these kind of one move situations my next opponent is rated 1127 that game that first game had one or two mistakes and that's just sort of life I mean that's just sort of how it goes uh and uh you know there's sometimes not much you can do about it let me play the King's Pawn and anything I cover in this video uh you know if I'm covering an opening course or something uh then I will obviously uh recommend it to you in the uh in the description uh and you can uh you can check out my courses which are on my courses website there's my doggy uh he thinks that I'm on a a corporate call so that's why he's here and he's getting pets anyway it's on my courses site Chesley feel free to check it out all right we have a caroon defense and I'm going to play D4 this is the most principled way to play against the carocon now there are many ways to play against the caroan one of my favorite ways is the advance but in this particular game I'm not going to play like any you know Gambit I'm going to play the Fantasy variation to show you with uh how annoying the fantasy variation really is in the fantasy you play F3 and your idea is to take back and have a big Center like you would if you had a fantasy position now the best move by black is in fact to strike with this move E5 and the other idea now is Queen to H4 which normally doesn't do anything because there's a Pawn on F2 but right now the pawn is gone so Knight F3 okay now black has to be very careful they have to remember how to develop they generally should not take the pawn on D4 and my idea is to play Bishop here and Castle this is what I and I think my dog just farted so my dog just decided to come up to me and celebrate with me this wonderful return of how to win a chess by farting in an enclosed space and now I have to smell it and I'm telling this to all of you so you can all laugh at me um yeah that's that's that's the life of a dog owner so my opponent's having a thought and that's not a good sign in the fantasy it is very difficult in the fantasy variation to invent good moves this is what you have to play Bishop B6 is actually considered the top move uh in modern day chess Theory and I hope my opponent you know uh just invented that sort of on the spot and it it stops Bishop C4 so I'm actually going to play Bishop D3 however I just told you if you play Bishop D3 it you have to keep in mind what you are blocking and what you are making stronger and weaker I would take my queen's eye off that pawn so first I'm going to go here so I'm defending my center with the flank pawns with the c and the F pawns and uh Benji is very fascinated you can see his tail they're going swish swish very interested in the fantasy variation here uh and the idea is simply to play Bishop here in Castle it's one of the reasons I like the fantasy so much against the caroan there's a lot of good ways to play against the caroan but fantasy is is definitely a very nice one so long as you remember to protect your king I would say if you're below like 1100 I might not mess with the fantasy cuz again a lot of lines where your king might get open and if you're not careful and if you're not controlled look this is all about control a lot of you may be wondering why I haven't taken the pawn right like for any beginner watching that might be like what is Gotham doing well if I take the pawn I lose my right to Castle and I have doubled isolated eons and I know from experience that's not going to do me any favors the double disolated Pawn as a beginner I can completely understand why you would play that move right I completely get it I get it oh doggy go away please oh go go go go go go go please please stop it stop stop stop it oh my goodness battling the dog and battling my opponent now by the way here's the fantasy coming true oh and if you're wondering why now why I wouldn't play night takes Pawn well I did just tell you that move so if I play Knight takes Pawn I lose control of the H4 Square now the reason again fantasy is I'm getting two Pawns in the center I'm going to get two knights and I'm going to get my Bishops out safely I'm not going to get them captured uh and then I'm going to Castle I'm going to have a very very nice position this is exactly what the fantasy is it's a it's like Fantasy Land you know if you oh my good oh my oh my goodness please oh my god oh doggy please go over there stop sit down sit down thank you thank you I love you too but please stop walking under my desk and pulling on the wires oh Big Adventures here in the Gotham household um let us finish up our development and then I'm just going to Castle my king that is The Game Plan me personally against the fantasy what I like to do with black is I either like to blow open the center right away I like to play some of the more crazy lines or I just play Pawn to G6 and I just stay solid Bishop G7 and so on okay I mean my opponent excuse me is doing as good of a job as they can as you can see I've got the Pure Fantasy setup here the pawns are ready to go but to to be honest with you they're just happy to take space away like I just like controlling the center here and I'm also going to Castle short side another benefit of the fantasy on the third move is that when you trade and ultimately Castle you have the open f file which the opponent doesn't have so when I play Knight G5 I'm going to go after this position over here now hardest part the piece not the position over there hardest part about Chess the opening is done now what well the thing about Chess is it's all pattern recognition okay and what that means is you will see certain things on a chess board that you have seen before and if and and and it will give you certain ideas that come to mind or you will see something you've never seen before and you will frequently be reacting and it's a mix of tactics it's a mix of pieces directly clashing and interacting with one another and also long-term strategic stuff example of long-term strategic stuff is is that Bishop is covering the dark squares so I have a plan I'm going to go here trade that Bishop with my my bishop and queen right create a battery get my queen in there get my knight my queen and then mate that's that's a strategic idea right however a tactical idea is Queen goes there and attacks the pawn that's like an immediate thing that's happening another idea is I have a discovered attack which would attack the queen and the bishop but the queen can take my Bishop because actually nobody's protecting my Bishop these are tactics right another idea Knight to G5 then I would take the bishop and leave my opponent with a weakness but every time we move something we got to look at what our opponent sees as well and my opponent is staring at that pawn if I move my knight I lose a defender of that pawn let's not forget I'm also getting attacked here so to defend this I'm thinking Rook B1 or I'm thinking Queen here to go after this plan also Queen here enables this this is generally going to be a better move because I connect my Rooks and I don't really want the Rook on B1 although Rook B1 was also fine it just didn't defend the bishop right like my Bishop now has a Defender which means this is an idea and actually wow my opponent well spotted whether that was by accident or not now I'm going to carry out my my plan right my plan was to trade off my opponent's dark squared Bishop to weaken their King right and to um potentially create an attack if you compare the two Bishops for black probably this is the better one this bishop is not bad it's okay but I think the more important bishop and the better Bishop is this one another easy way to judge the better Bishop is count the pawns and the bishop on the opposite color of the pawns is generally the more important Bishop you look at White's position it's 11 11 111 I have a perfectly balanced Pawn structure three white three black which means that for me you know the Bishops are sort of interchangeable right like they're both okay but black has five out of six pawns on light squares that means that Black's light squared Bishop is slightly less impactful all right slightly less impactful I've put my opponent under a little bit of pressure here now if you ever get a position like this you you generally shouldn't take okay you generally shouldn't take because Queen is going to come here and attack you you would rather be taken I like that my opponent is uh kind of acknowledging that now we could do something here with white called keeping the tension just keep the tension play like a a rook move for example Rook D1 just bringing a Rook no questions asked this move improved our position it just brought a rook to the center I mean we can debate whether it was better to put the Rook there or there and generally at most levels of Chess you're not good enough to even understand even me I'm not insulting you I'm just saying it's hard it's hard and chess to always be right about the positioning of The Rook um but now like excuse Meo recovering from a a throat thing um in general you know you uh at some point in a chess game you got you kind of got to decide like do I go for it now like what am I you know what am I going for and um do I kill the tension do I do I continue to to to put something there what does my opponent want do they want to put the Knight there is it worth acknowledging like is it worth being scared of this move let me take this bishop now and we got to decide how we're going to attack here I still still like the concept of taking this bishop but I also kind of wish I could get my queen a bit more involved in the attack like maybe queen queen F2 and get the queen to the F6 square or queen F2 and then Queen H4 but I don't know I don't see anything like super conclusive so I feel like this is a very natural move at this level just to try to take the bishop and create a weakness however by venturing out here with my knight I have weakened the D4 Pawn now I got to tell you my opponent's playing great like this playing great game they might go here attacking my queen and they might blunder that the bishop is defending the Knight and if I take it it's check so very common mistake would be Knight C4 but just in general like you shouldn't over complicate things like right now black should probably go here that's what black should do just bring a rook to the center put some pressure I can defend this Pawn in a multitude of ways but black is doing completely fine here uh black is maybe a touch worse because again I have a strong Center and everything but for 1100 level this is like an equal position basically I mean this is not nothing to write home about for me I would expect maybe H6 to ask me what I'm doing here with my knight of course the plan is to take okay Bishop C4 is also uh an idea and I'm going to I'm going to take the bishop and now my knight I'm I'm under attack here so a lot of people would go here and blunder this uh I am going to play Queen E2 and what's funny is there's a very strong tactic in this position chess is all about patterns I told you it's all patterns so there's a tactic here which is Knight to E6 check remember Knight to E6 and I can enable Knight to E6 6 by playing Rook takes F7 which is a brutal move Rook takes F7 check if Rook takes I have Knight E6 and I win the queen so right now Rook takes F7 is winning that's kind of tough to play as an 1100 though it really is a much more human move as an 1100 is something like Queen F2 to try to play Queen F6 that's much more human Rook F7 but this is why you always have to look for checks this is is a tactic like that's why you do puzzles because they appear in your games and you're missing them you're missing tactics in your games I promise you know and and Rook F7 96 it's just it's there and with three minutes on the clock it's probably not findable another practical word of advice here great move by the way another practical word of advice here if you're playing Rapid or something um you see how I'm up a minute let's try to maintain that let's just try to force ourselves to the move like right now you know I want to get another piece into the game uh let let me March my Pawn forward okay I'm marching the pawn forward it's supported very nicely and I'm creating a pass Pawn I don't know if it's the best decision but I have three and a half minutes like we just got to go uh that move re allows Queen F6 but is that what I want right all right well I you know I don't let's put the queen on on on D4 right the king is going to go back to G8 if this of course we have a fork right so we we know that already that's that's always there for us now I need some help my queen needs a little bit of help how can I get my queen some assistance here may maybe a knight maybe a knight can get into the position for me maybe a knight right yeah what if I what if I get my queen some help in the form of a knight now black has a vicious move here which is this defending Knight F6 and threatening matate it's never too late to hang check mate right Knight F5 now the best move is probably to sacrifice The Rook but let's just carry out our plan let's play Knight F6 check our Queen is hanging we got to be really careful got to be really careful where's the king going to go where's the king going to go where's it going here or here remember wherever you go and I'm going to attack you with my knight you're going to be threatening my queen so now we have to be creative now we got to go if I move this Knight it's a discovered attack and I can take the queen probably like here right but my Queen's under attack don't move your queen perfect example of a sacrifice you sacrifice The Rook for the Knight and you maintain this attack the only reason this wouldn't work is if your opponent doesn't have to take back which they don't but they don't have anything better do they they have a check no do they have a way to attack your queen no so you sacrifice The Rook for the Knight perfect example you invest five you get three back but on the very next move you're going to be delivering the kiss of death knight E8 check you have other moves you can play like Knight H7 probably but this is this is it right here and that is uh that that is how we're going to be breaking through in this position but the best part is we don't even have to take the queen we have this and that was all from the big Center given to us in the fantasy and again we had a slight Advantage for most of the game and I showed you the difference between tactical play tactics and all the pieces interacting and what your opponent sees very important and long-term strategic thinking right this kind of plan to trade the bishop that's more long-term strategic chess and you're not always going to make the best plans all right I was showing you how like Knight G5 this is this is not a particularly good plan but I thought it was pretty applicable for this level and then here my opponent ran into a difficult spot where Rook takes F7 was winning but I thought you know what at like 1,200 in the middle of a game I don't know how findable that is if I'm being honest so I tried to be respectful you know I tried to be responsible and instead played Queen F2 and just sort of tried to build up the position very important that you know when to just start making that progress that step into your opponent's territory taking away space posing problems and it was a slow and methodical process but at the end of the day the dark squared weaknesses created when we traded off our opponent's Bishop led to these problems and this was a very instructive method of transferring in some attacking pieces now I obviously had better stuff the computer is saying Queen H4 and uh and then Rook F3 and and you know and that that is instructive that is instructive but I thought I thought it was a little bit more instructive to play Knight E4 Knight F6 and this is not the the sacrifice of The Rook is not the most is not the most challenging thing in the world you kind of have to understand the concept of a sacrifice and why we do things and uh and that type of thing but I I I thought I thought it was instructive and I thought I thought this was a pretty clear depiction of um of how to do it and and when to invest and how to get it back so that's the fantasy caroan uh one of the best ways to play against the caroan and my next opponent is not online um so I'm going to Ping them uh let's see and then we're going to see if we're going to get a game need you to refresh and my dog is under my T my chair again I will ask him Benji come here over here down please down I understand you want pets but big things are happening right now all right here we go game time against uh 1424 first game was a London versus a Dutch that game was a caroon fantasy variation my opponent plays E4 I got to go for it I just recently launched the Scandinavian defense course if you don't have it you really should check it out even the free sample I I've been telling you like this is one of my favorite openings to play right now the queen takes D5 Scandinavian defense and we're going to put the queen right on that square and then we're going to go to we're going to go to work all right my opponent plays this Gambit all right so whenever you're you got any opening that you have in your toolbox there's going to be people that play aggressive stuff against it and this is no different this is called The Lion Heart Gambit but I have a very simple and practical response in my course which is you're under attack like this we go back and we go back again that's it we go back to D6 if we're attacked we go back to d8 and from here our setup is very straightforward Knight F6 Pawn to A6 covering B5 and then we just develop we put our our Bishop out one of these you know we put either the bishop out there or we put the bishop out this way and we just develop our Knight Pawn to A6 and then we play and we're just the pawn up now White's idea of B4 is all right I got this open file you know I'm very scary and stuff but if black just plays smart Black's just up a pawn it's not really now the most challenging way for white to play is G3 to try to put the bishop on that diagonal and play Bishop F4 I I oop Play Bishop F4 I do have this covered in the Scandinavian Course and there you have to be a little precise but even if you're not precise like even if you just play solidly but a little bit passively you're um you're still going to get a very very you know okay and totally playable position so we we can't go here all right that's the whole point of White's setup so you can't make that mistake but you can just Castle you can play E6 Bishop E7 Castle the king sooner than later you're going to move this B Pawn two squares and you'll be fine all right the best way for white to play is to Castle fast and start trying to attack try try to just move forward just say like I'm down upon Pawn but you're a boso for playing the Scandinavian and yeah sometimes you know I'm glad my opponent kind of showed this because um sometimes you do have to know how to deal with the unpleasant uh lines that your opponent could throw your way uh in your favorite opening and right now right now my favorite opening is is probably the Scandinavian defense I am having so much fun playing it and I'm really really enjoying myself I like the positions but I don't get this a lot I I had a Grandmaster play this Gambit against me in title Tuesday Robert hungi who is from Argentina uh and the US I mean he lived many years I think in the US but uh and I and I got a great position I was just comfortably better but then I lost so that you know it you when the opening serves its purpose but then you drive the car off a cliff the opening serves its purpose you know the airbags in the car uh did their job but I unfortunately did something even more crazy so all right taking a sip of coffee next two games are against 17 and 2100 going to be very very big games I got to be really really locked in uh in a position like this I'm always looking at moves like Knight E4 and Knight E5 various Knight hops forward with black I'm considering already B5 Bishop B7 if I get to play those two moves I'm not even on the defensive anymore like right now I would argue I'm still a little passive I'm trying to play a lot of moves that set spikes they don't let my opponent in but I'm restricted I can't really move these pieces so easily okay does this have a threat no the first move I'm considering is H6 at which point I imagine my opponent will play Knight to E4 I don't like that that move activates my opponent's Queen this this is this is definitely this is definitely a good move uh all things considered it it is it is definitely a good move by my opponent now I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to play Knight C6 I mean I I could play H6 but there is no threat and I'm setting up pressure on this Pawn I can't actually take it right away tactics I told you tactics strategy right so I can't take that pawn right away because there's a discovered check at the end so now the question is do I take the Knight or do I move my queen out of the way I don't see a reason why I wouldn't take the Knight like if the Knight takes I just move my queen if the bishop takes I can't even take the Knight and I can relieve the pressure so both are probably okay but I'm down I'm I'm I'm up a pawn and so I kind of like the concept of simplification here a little bit I also am considering can I take the Knight remove the defender and take this Pawn like that looks that looks pretty good I got to tell you that that doesn't look half bad take the Knight remove the defender and then take this this now if the queen takes me then my opponent can take on B7 right they could take Bishop B7 but at that point I'm still I'm still up so why don't we can why don't I just go for that right like why can't I'm just going to take and and again this way I relieve the attack so the attack is relieved and now I just see a very clear-cut plan forward to trade now by the way I don't even have to trade the Queens I just mentally I'm thinking with no queens I'll never get mated that's just mentally my little hypothesis right I could play Knight takes Bishop takes Knight Knight takes here you know I'm under a bit of pressure right the Bishops are a little bit scary but scary in chess doesn't mean anything tangible it just means scary it doesn't mean Checkmate it just means oh there's pieces pointed at my king okay if my opponent got two moves in a row right now they would win okay they're kind of trying to get two moves in a row right now but they might have blundered so my opponent went here and the idea of this move is that's made and my Bishop's hanging that was the idea I can protect mate with my Pawn but then they would take my Bishop I can protect mate with this Pawn but then they would take my bishop and I can't take back because I would get mated now I think this move is actually still okay because let's not forget that pawn is under attack but I don't have to sit and wait and I think what I can do is I can play F5 and after I play F5 I stop mid and I'm attacking a bishop and I think my opponent missed this move so now mid is covered that piece has not been let's not forget I took a knight right now I'm up a knight so when you play a move like this you got to be really really careful that this defensive move doesn't just defend right because now my opponent if they move the bishop I'm taking this and I got that Bishop took two things so the best move for my opponent right now is to take this Knight hoping that I take back and then they take my Bishop but I'm going to take the bishop so now my Bishop took a knight and a bishop and this bishop's still hanging so it's chaos it's complete chaos all right uh but what's going to happen at the end is I'm going to be up a piece because I started the capture chain right so very simple we could take this a lot of beginners would just snap that but no we just go here and now that Bishop's hanging but I have two of them on the board so when my opponent goes here I'm just going to take back and my opponent can't take two Bishops at the same time right so they go there probably take with the queen or the pawn you know I'll take with the Queen but dust settles and I'm just up a bishop and that was because my opponent went for that Queen H5 idea they should have kept it a little bit simple anytime you don't you don't Auto take back and you're down a piece you've got to be so certain that when the dust settles you don't just emerge down material you can't just bum rush and go for an attack at the 1400 level maybe it would have worked but I was trying to show you how to trade off there take a moment pause and it was a Valiant attempt but they missed this F pawn move and that's a lesson that's a lesson for the future right now I'm going to play here and create a battery with my queen and Bishop uh the lesson for the future being be very careful of the F Pawn near the king when you attack like this so now my queen and Bishop are very strong and just like game number one I'm just going to try to simplify in chess you can trade pieces and win end games uh you can also go for mate uh and uh in this particular case I think just a direct assault on the white King is worth pursuing but of course if we trade the Queens uh it is also totally winnable that's a good move actually that's that's that's that's quite a good move uh my idea was to go Rook F6 and why white is not you know white is not without hope it's not totally without hope there's still a way for me to you know blunder something crazy and I I kind of respect my opponent's fighting Spirit by the way this was a free Pawn which for some reason I did not address whatsoever I guess I will address it on the very next move I just wasn't even paying attention I was just going straight for the king but Queen C2 you know in general if you can win a few more pawns it's it's probably worthwhile okay uh Rook let's just play Rook G6 now I have three things as you can see converging over there and you know Rook G3 I'll take I Ian I won't even hesitate of course I will trade some Rooks less pieces my opponent has less chance I have of doing something silly and losing and at that point once I pick up enough pawns at that point I can I can I can lose a little bit of material like I'm not I also do have Queen F3 which is kind of a funny move I can get two pieces but I would not leave your opponent with the only Queen on the board I wouldn't do that uh is this their way of resigning is this was that their way of resigning or was that a mouse lip I'm confused anyway check maybe my opponent wanted to play Queen E7 I'm not sure but King H1 and uh we will pick up the Rook this is a discovered attack and we can win in a variety of ways that's life that is life that is what happens check check me there we go okay uh instructive game uh I would say that um you know characterized by I playing I played the Scandinavian my opponent played this Gambit and I sort of knew the best way to defend myself which was uh which was to bring the queen back and this is all in the Scandinavian course this type of setup and you know black is fine like white definitely has some compensation in in the form of a little bit of activity but I thought I played this pretty intelligently Knight G5 was a logical move and then you know taking the Knight is not the best but I thought it was practical and I thought it was practical because I'm simply going to trade the queen next the computer thinks trading the queen is not the best move but the computer also says for white doing this is not best and then after take take take you know know take take Knight back to D4 we would have played this position and I would have been up a pawn and I would try to win you can't really ask for a whole lot more from your opening like a comfortable position up a pawn unfortunately this move runs into not even just F5 I also could have brought my Bishop back which is kind of instructive I didn't even consider this move uh and the point is that I'm just getting in the way of the mate and then when this happens now I have to play F5 but F5 is the best move it defends it attacks and just you got to be really careful I mean you got to be really careful if you're if you're trying to attack somebody you need to get into a situation they can't do what I did which is just trade all your pieces like if they're just going to trade all your material you're never really going to succeed in attacking somebody so you have to do it in a way where you preserve some of your attacking pieces and that's probably why you know this was better and the computer agrees and my plan was to go here and then maybe white can play Queen H5 and be aggressive but I would have still had to play F5 but this is a very different story cuz here's a nice way white can win in two moves Knight F6 check right and this is an attack where white preserved all those pieces and was able to uncork something like that so I would have had to defend myself really really uh nicely there um but that's life again it's an example of my opponent went for it and it just so happens that sometimes the mistake that you run into is is not just good for your opponent defensively it also you know it it it it's also an offensive type of move now uh next opponent of mine is rated 1,700 so I played E4 one game uh I what what what should I play uh in this one I think I'm going to play an English I'll play C4 this is uh already you know this is this is Advanced territory we have a reverse Sicilian so Kings like this uh and I'm going to play two knights and then I'm going to play Pawn to G3 I'm play like this target the pawn in the center it's very normal stuff in the English now I'm going to play this move Pawn to G3 and the best way for black to play here is to put uh another piece in the center Bishop B4 is a move I think technically according to Theory the best move is to jump the night here but again 1700 I'm just going to develop this is a good idea by my opponent just solid I'm going a castle and in the English you rely on queenside advancement so you rely on things like Rook B1 A3 B4 black relies on Dam on damaging your structure and delaying some of that Queen side play but I'm going to play D3 uh because obviously I don't want to lose this Pawn maybe then I will go here and then an argument of what to be done in the center of the board also my opponent hasn't committed their King so I don't know if they go long I'll be very happy okay that move doesn't do much it stops me from pinning which makes sense and and I I still know that this is an idea so what about something like Bishop D2 and then A3 cuz I don't want to I mean I know that move is possible right you you want to avoid a a situation in chess where this move is like always available and then you force your opponent to do it I would rather make an improving move now I made an improving move and I would like to play A3 right so I've sort of gotten all my pieces out and I'm ready to to justify the English which is helping out my light sored Bishop in the corner there with a queenside expansion it's just a very solid opening at some point my opponent could start to play moves like D5 okay they commit their King I think I'm going to continue with my plan and of course that was the reason I put the bishop there it was to not damage my pawns it was to take back with the bishop and I think this is a good position for white let me tell you why D5 is now a little bit less powerful because I have a direct line of sight on this Pawn okay uh another move that's not powerful is Knight to D4 because I control it very well so A5 right looking at B4 kind of always considering this move after Pawn takes Pawn takes and then I have B5 ideas that looks pretty comfortable I also have Queen B3 which attacks the pawn on B7 um I also can slow play but and then I I mean there is another question about this move E4 but let's just play B4 this looks very much like what I'm supposed to do right this is what I I I just said all of that everything that I just said expand on the queen side I now have the bishop pair right I have the two Bishops versus the one bishop and the real question is just will my opponent strike the center ever and then how will I deal with that if E4 taking might not be recommended cuz I weaken this Pawn also I would allow my opponent's Knight in I expect this at which point I will of course bring my queen over there which will pressure more on the diagonal but we are having a staring contest right now nobody has to take anybody this is my next move though kick the Knight out of the center apply more pressure take space away from black right so the idea there is to take back and the other idea is to team up the queen and the bishop to go there which is smart it's a smart idea all right let's play B5 shoving the Night backwards a little bit typical English Shenanigans here yes and now a very common way to deal with this is to play Rook E1 and the idea of Rook e one is that when the bishop goes there I slide back and I say no thank you I don't want a bishop trade but we just saw this in the fantasy caroon game right we saw me do something kind of similar but I I don't have to take anything I mean I can be taken right I can be taken I don't have to allow my opponent you know any any fun now here we also see the problem of the English I've played 14 moves the position is still pretty balanced you know I'm not steamrolling my opponent despite having a 700 Point advantage on them it shows you that this this opening is really made for the long term it's really made for the long-term type of grind long-term type of pressure um and you have to understand the ideas right the ideas are trading off your your your piece like this another idea could be my opponent starting an attack on me Gotham knows what he's talking about uh but I I I don't I'm not really in intimidated by this but I do think my opponent is trying to you know put a piece behind that attack now I do have H4 H4 is kind of an interesting poking back at the opponent and asking them what exactly it is they want I kind of like it but I I wonder if I have something even better like I I have to anticipate that this is on the way I was thinking to play Queen D2 Knight G6 maybe I can trade some Rooks and then just try to win the end game that is a possibility uh but I I probably should have a getaway ready let's poke I'm going to poke I'm going to say you really want to attack me you really want to play this game go G4 go G4 permanently blocking this idea so you cannot trade my Bishop right go G4 stopping our pawns making sure they get locked up and look at my Bishop now right I just have a clean Target and the second that black moves a pawn one of these pawns something is going to get weak okay my opponent luckily missed that move question is do I take I might get trapped in there which is a little bit scary what if I take the Rook look at this take the Rook take the pawn with a Tempo now I get out if I had done this in reverse and I took my opponent would have traded Rooks with me and tried to trap my Bishop it's probably still fine but the way I did it is now I attack the rook and I'm getting right back out now I'm a pawn up and my English pressure is paying off right I'm getting the the the Vintage English attack and black can't really do a whole lot on this file I got to be honest with you like black will probably play Rook A7 which makes a lot of sense uh but Rook A3 three doesn't do anything cuz I just play Queen C1 or Knight B1 but or Bishop B4 like you know so you kind of yeah I I wouldn't I get it my opponent's trying to attack me uh let's drop all the way home and there we go we grab the pawn this is this is the the perfect English right the English is really paying off here and what my opponent is going to try to do is mate me with the F Pawn that that is that is my opponent's game plan here they brought the Rook back or like that and they are going to try to Checkmate me now how am I going to try to play the best way to deal with a person that's trying to attack you on the side of the board is to strike back in the center and now I am able to play the move d4 I couldn't play that move let's say in this position maybe I could have like it could have gotten tactical but my Pawn had no defense and so this plan hiding behind my pawns defends my pawn and now you you can't for for my strong intermediate and early Advance folks don't follow sleep on the pawns don't forget about the pawns they can move and now that they're going to be mobile you're not going to attack anybody and I think I'm winning because I can trap the bishop look at this that Bishop stuck behind the pawn and the queen Bishop's going to slide forward and I'm going to play E4 and that's it and we're just up a piece and then from there of course we will convert this is how you play the English this was a really nice game actually uh this was like a a perfect demonstration of how resilient and positionally annoying the English is to deal with it is a very tough opening to play against and I would you know but again its true value is felt at like 1,700 1,600 and higher because at early level you don't appreciate the squeeze that you put on people you know I think my opponent should take and then probably grab the second Pawn but uh okay what's funny is I don't even have to capture yet but the idea is to open up right the idea is to uh open up the uh okay I'm not worried I mean oh that was the idea okay can play E4 to just stop then I'm blocking my Bishop but I think it's fine because again I'm just thinking what does my opponent want and I'm just trying to stop it right I didn't have to do that but I know my opponent would love to open up the f file and I'm just just not going to let it happen and so now we will just try to trade some pieces uh maybe Queen C2 put the Rook on the open file and go down in this way now of course I'm I'm ready for F5 I mean I'm I'm ready for this move that that is the one move that I have been prepared for for quite some time but I'm up a piece and even if it sits back here for now I can reroute it I'm ready for the position to open up I you you're just not you're not going to be able to you know what I mean you're you're you can't just flip on the switch and start attacking if you have less material right I've been I've been waiting for this move now the position opens up and I can put my knight there I can play Bishop here I can play Bishop here of course I I'm looking at different sacrifices and in chess you just don't want to get caught just like in fighting I I blundered actually I just straight up blundered this Pawn so there you go I I was trying to attack my opponent Counterattack my opponent and I blundered I mean I just straight up that I mean like this is just a silly mistake and and you know that was careless I should have probably played here first Ah that's not a good move though my opponent respected me a little bit too much Knight G G5 yeah maybe now I will defend my pawn and I'm I would love a queen trade by the way I would love a queen trade Queen trade would be great knight G5 would be nice and as I've been saying throughout today's video if you're going to attack somebody you need to have more attacking pieces than you know than uh than defending and if my opponent sacrifices I'm just trading the queen ASAP you're not going to beat me with a rook and a knight versus Rook Bishop Bishop Knight it's just not possible right so I I you know I'm I may be expecting this move there's a there's another way to do this there's a way to sack like this and put that night there but all that is is just it looks scary that's it uh Knight G5 you know again I'm I I really I really would like to be by the book and by the book would be to trade the queens and I think this is just by far the easiest it's a little bit boring but with no queens nobody's ever going to lose my opponent cannot go to the file because I will meet them right there they cannot go to B8 because I'll defend the pawn or I'll defend it with my my rook and it's just about negating some of this forward momentum so I'll put the bishop on that square I'll put the Rook on A1 uh that attacks my Pawn stiff neck Knight G5 defending my pawn and trying to get a little bit closer into the black position also this trade the Knight not necessary but stuff that I'm considering of course I am primarily focusing on getting the Knight into the game like that uh is there any forward jumps not really so I think we can play Knight E6 Rook C8 and I can probably just go for it right like I can just go win the pawn I don't actually have to wait and then I will push my B Pawn I didn't have Rook C1 cuz my Bishop was in the way but now yeah Knight D4 makes sense um we can take but I got to be honest with you don't get tunnel vision trading might just be by far the easiest solution here and I can play Rook D1 and take this Pawn or I can play Rook C1 and go after that one now the best thing for black is to play D3 like you should try to use what you have because you never know you know I might blunder trade the Rooks and allow the pawn through you you just don't know uh I won't because I'm you know I'm fully aware of how annoying this thing could be let's take a pause let's just stop the pawn in its tracks yeah and now let's get rid of the Knight and so black doesn't have enough but if if we allow them then they have enough that's that's the truth all right so now we have a big time advantage and we are going to just simply trade down into a winning end game we're going to take the knight uh probably I can even defend that pawn but let's just keep it simple and just Rook C3 and I don't you know you gota you got to really defend yourself here there's a trick by the way interesting trick there's a rook B7 and it looks like okay this was a mistake you you did not want my king over here previously if Rook B7 and I had gone D6 look if the Rook had gone there and I went D6 with an attack on The Rook black would have had a check but by checking my my king to H2 now my Pawn is queening so yeah unfortunately or fortunately depends we could just play D6 Rook E7 is even cleaner just grabs the pawn right away it doesn't allow black to get anything and this never got anywhere I'm very glad to say we completely neutralized that attack you know what's interesting about this game is that I feel like everything that I talked out into happening happened in in the sense that I'm not even sure a game review is all that valuable like Rook behind the pawn I'm going to push the pawn right and push the pawn we're going to defend the pawn with the bishop and now we'll just this is what we're going to we're going to walk the king over there that's what we're going to do to King King King King just don't lose your Rook uh I can take the pawn and yeah I mean I can just come back everything is guarding everything everything is defended yeah but now I put the Rook on a defended Square I make a queen and then I win the game actually very curious like I I I I felt like I played quite reasonably sometimes I I deliberately miss a chance and I um yeah but it was a it was a good game uh okay I got hit with an inaccuracy in the opening I got hit with multiple inaccuracies in the opening which I find quite funny uh yeah my opponent got a little bit little bit overzealous here with this move G5 but this is like this everything you saw in this game is the way the English works and this advancement on the queen side all of this and then neutral ing my opponent taking taking coming back and then playing D4 all of this was like exactly how you're supposed to play the English this type of position this kind of cascade like this waterfall of Pawns is the way the English is uh generally generally done in these sorts of uh English middle games and then at the right moment once you've pushed your opponent's pieces out of the center you you strike in in the um on the open board and for black there are some positions where you can strike in the center right away like E4 but if you're not careful you know white White's always got a way to zigzag out you know white can zigzag out in a multiple of ways early even backwards even backwards and be totally okay um oh and sitting and staring at the screen for an hour even backwards is okay uh but uh yeah the position is is quite fluid for white quite quite mobile with a lot of different ideas and it's one of the reasons I I I I really liked English and okay I mean the computer telling me you know Bishop D2 is an inaccuracy on low depth game review is kind of annoying but this is the way you play it right like this is the opponent tries to do this to you you get out of the way uh or you play Queen C2 you know you allow this but even if you trade everything and get something like this you still have a little bit more space it's just always a little bit more pleasant to play White just a little bit transfer your pieces there put some pressure take you know E4 shut down D5 this type of thing and overall I thought I thought I thought that was quite smooth now for the last game of the video I'm playing a uh playing a strong player I'm playing a 2100 uh don't know much about this individual that's how we scary uh and they're not even online go to play online and refresh please all right typical it happens there we go now what I don't like is that my opponent's got a troll Emoji which you know who knows they might all right game is aborted I win and that ends the return of how to win a chess that ends that all right tremendous that was a good game let's try that again E4 all right uh well I played I played one Scandinavian I feel a little bit silly playing another Scandinavian we can play a modern we can play a a French I I play a lot of carocon we can play E5 let's play a modern with G6 G6 modern lot of setups by white so we got to be ready okay this already gives me information because White's not playing the most aggressive way possible which is good white put a knight in in front of the F Pawn white could have played three pawns and that would have been a bit scary now I'm trying to go for B5 white is seemingly playing the classical setup just Knights and Bishops and stuff uh but now might make a move that commits something that doesn't actually commit a whole lot now for black there's a there's a handful of ways to play this I I could go for the B5 approach right away but my opponent never played uh cuz my because my opponent never played A4 I can play Knight to C6 targeting the pawn in the center I can just play Knight F6 and play it normally I can trade the bishop for the Knight another thing I could do with uh we don't do that this is kind of a very sneaky approach the idea was to pressure put some pressure on that pawn Knight C6 more pressure I expect D5 move makes some sense and I haven't touched my knight but another way to play this is to put the Knight on F6 then put the Knight on D7 and then play E5 another very common way to play This Modern develop the Knight what doesn't that just hang a pawn sambit or did my opponent just blunder a pawn I mean I will take a pawn blunder but uhoh might be nerves well hey if we could use the modern to win a pawn against the 2100 rated player I'll take it you know what I mean like I'll I I will that shows you the power of the Gotham G6 uh course you know and my doggy has approached to to check in yeah this is tough I guess my opponent didn't really ever get to settle down now okay being upon Pawn is being a being upon PA being down upon is not the worst thing in the world but it's uh it's definitely better to be up upon than down upon uh I could do a lot of things I mean I I can leave but let's just keep the Knight there and then we can play Knight F6 and Castle uh and I was going to say it's not the worst thing in the world to be down upon because my opponent can I don't know if you can hear that that that is now the dog very loudly kicking himself in the head and scratching himself just standard doggy activities Benji hey Benji I'm trying to finish up the how to win a chess video if you want attention I got to finish this game and then I'll give you attention go over there go go thank you now what I was going to say is something the worst thing to be down a pawn because the opponent could still go on some sort of big attack right like ultimately if you're hurt you're a you know fighter or something like that they always say the wounded animal is the most dangerous trying to figure out the best way to develop here uh E6 Knight E7 or Knight F6 blocking my Bishop I think I like E6 Knight E7 because I would like my knight to have more defense on it than not now for my opponent probably the best thing to do is just to go crazy just to go as aggressively as possible and that could be quite interesting anyway and I I I would say black does not have that big of an advantage here actually the pawn is nice but seeing this is quite spooky I have to say it's uh it's definitely there is some potency to that attack now if you're a positional player and instead you want to slow play sometimes s what you want and what the position demands do not match up at all okay that move makes some sense um I mean I I can take but the question is do I want to Dam double my pawns right I I might not have to double my pawns maybe I take with the bishop but probably this is fine this should be fine opponent's going to go Knight E2 I me if we play Knight A4 I just win the game just trapped the knight uh there's nothing in particular so I will continue with my plan we have opposite colored Bishops so if we get into an end game could be drawsh I need to make sure we don't just trade every single piece and yes that is how strong chess players think they do think like opposite colored Bishops you know like I got to be mindful of that this is still the best move uh and I still have to be careful I still have to respect the potential of an attack which my opponent is just completely refusing to do I mean they are not playing F4 and uh they really have to uh we can check the game review it will undoubtedly say that that is the best thing to do did I blunder I might have missed that move that's just a clean Fork do I have a way to maybe I didn't quite blunder maybe I did maybe I did maybe I did um I can play there's a lot of possibilities in General if the queen goes here I'm looking at ways to trap it but they don't exist because if I go Knight C6 Queen takes B7 my knight is under attack okay so since I don't have that start looking at well if I what if I defend the pawn right E5 Queen B7 I don't I get Rook B you know but then my opponent takes this so then I started thinking what if I defend the pawn on B7 well then Knight takes D4 and that's when I realized the queen defending the Knight on D4 is the real point if I can deflect the queen away from the defense of the Knight I'm going to win that is how I found this move now if the Knight takes the pawn I play A5 and the only way to defend the Knight is to walk into a pin and I will absolutely destroy that pin this move enables me to save this Pawn but take enough space away from White that they cannot take on D4 I had a feeling sometime I had a feeling that this was possible like I had a feeling that I would have had something like this but and now this is just winning my opponent blundered they probably have to sack the Knight somehow yeah they probably thought I was going to go Queen B6 but yeah A5 is that's tough and now like sometimes strong players have luck on their side in the sense that obscure moves like this Escape our mind but it's almost as if passively we knew there was something wrong with it and it just felt off something about this move felt off like it just felt off that you could just walk into the center and be defended by your queen I felt like there's got to be a way for me to exploit that and that's how I figured out this move because I realized when my opponent takes they're lagging like they they're behind in coordination and so now the queen can cannot actually successfully defend the Knight and we're going to win in 15 moves we just have a uh have a winning position because the The Queen's out of space the queen was on that space it'd be fine but now yeah now now black is completely winning uh the modern is very tricky and we're going to analyze I'm going to show you how probably like four moves in a row the best move for white was to play F4 just get aggressive except that you lost the pawn early but also you should have a weapon against the modern like you know 2100 having openings against every opening is not the best approach to chess but and of course you're not always going to be playing a YouTuber you're not always going to be having a nervous nervous energy or something but um you know it's still worth learning and opening against everything so Queen B6 or Rook C8 uh I don't see any reason not to play this move so I'm going to do it and now white is completely lost just go going to win the night and um yeah that's tough I mean I'm happy I'm happy you know 2100 to end the episode and and again I'm I'm I'm in a state where I'm trying to give everybody a shot I'm not trying to always play 100% the best moves it's a tough mindset to be in because you know chess is uh chess is killer be killed out here you know so but I think this was instructive I think this was kind of instructive how to play the modern and how to defend in the Scandinavian the other game that had lacked the first game how to play a Dutch against the London lot of common openings in these positions I think we faced uh that I think a lot of people face I'm going to take with the queen because then the bishop can't oh I guess that was stupid that was this was like an hour and a half of Chess talking they still couldn't be taken but I'll take with the queen and when they go here I'll just come back and I just have an extra night let me tell you I'm going to win this game up a night I probably would have won the game not up a night but up a night I'll definitely win let's push the p Pawn forward just take some space away uh restrict the white position and I'll probably look for a queen trade or a knight for Bishop trade pretty soon go here here put a rook on the open file just restricting my opponent really still on the ver you know still on the prowl looking at all of this but now it's obviously a lot less potent we have that that same Bishop from several games now I had this bishop in my previous English game I had I was on the other side uh in the fantasy earlier with a bishop here but my opponent can't get rid of that Bishop so attacking me is going to be very difficult and uh yeah they they messed up a little bit early but that's life that's what happens sometimes let's Bother us our opponent for a queen trade I expect this and then probably F4 by the way Queen H4 maybe just Queen F6 like just keep bothering my opponent for a queen trade keep bothering my opponent for a queen trade and now I'll play Knight C6 time also up two minutes taking that a little bit for granted but okay now I am setting up a fork which will force the bishop off the board can also Advance my Pawn I mean there's there's a lot of things you can do as long as you're not making a mistake for example I might not go eat that pawn because I would be pinning my knight to my Queen right like I I I see this but I would much prefer to just strip my opponent completely of pieces because with no pieces you're not going to create tactics you're not going to attack me and my life will be a little bit easier just a little bit not like not a whole lot but enough easier you know anyway I have a minute and a half and we will come to an end of how to win a chess hopefully you enjoyed uh again you're interested in Scandinavian or modern or Dutch or any of the Gotham courses they are available on Chesley free like free samples you don't I'm not saying if you want to buy anything and I will be trying to upload this series I think once a week I'm going to try to do once a week maybe once every two weeks bring it back maybe on Sundays how does that sound Sunday how to win at chess episodes that's what we'll do take the bishop Rook on the open file my baby dog just let out the deepest side he has such a difficult life of napping on the floor and getting fed good food and and getting pets he just hears me talking so he knows that when I'm talking I'm usually on meetings so would he's on you know he's used to getting pets anyway uh okay look we can continue to play this dance or we can just start capturing pawns although technically I made a mistake my opponent can play Rook C1 my opponent could have played Rook C1 then I would have had to give up the queen for two Rooks but this I'll just win a couple of Pawns and I'm up a bishop and a pawn and four minutes so it's a pretty bad combination for white uh let's make sure we don't lose any pieces that's safe now and at this point I could probably sacrifice my queen and win of course I'm not going to do that I'm going to continue to play principal chess offering the trade of Queens to my opponent and we take with the pawn create a pass Pawn and uh this is a uh this is a win for us now I do just want to quickly analyze I want to see if uh I was correct in assuming that the best way to create counterplay was to move F4 I think that is instructive I think it's also pretty instructive for folks watching to know yeah when yeah H3 just loses a pawn that was just a big mistake white should have played D5 and then I would have probably jumped into the center although going backwards is also okay I would have maybe played Knight E5 or Knight D4 and we would have played some chess but unfortunately my opponent made a mistake and then here even yeah like here you know yeah F4 is it's up there it's the best move even here F4 is still the best move and the reason is if I castle and F5 is played I actually have to be a little careful if I trade everything look at the evaluation it's equal so I can't do this I actually have to leave my opponent's Pawn there and just sort of like operate around it you know try to go there and yeah then I have an advantage but my opponent should have been a bit faster with their counterplay when my opponent wasn't fast with their counterplay they went after my Pawn but I you know I have multiple tricks and traps here to play on the odd coordination of the white pieces and yeah unfortunately my opponent just missed A5 and some mistakes in chess are just fatal and this was a fatal mistake so overall I think I played pretty well today it was uh definitely the coffee that helped how to win at chess is most certainly back we played a Leningrad Dutch against the London we played uh E4 fantasy car oan we played uh the third game a Scandinavian we had to defend against the black side of a Gambit fourth game was an English pure and simple and this was a modern defense Pier modern you know G6 type of stuff where uh opponent blundered early they blundered their Center Pawn which does happen sometimes and we held on and had a nice trick and went on to win that's all I have for you today hope you enjoyed maybe I'll do this once or every two weeks get out of here
