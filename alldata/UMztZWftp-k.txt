today we're going to be looking at a very important concept in python which is truthy and falsey and this has to do with what python considers to be true and what python considers to be false because sometimes you can pass in a variable instead of having an expression and you can say if variable something's going to happen such as if we go ahead and say variable a and we say if variable print variable as you can see we can use this as an expression and if we actually go ahead and run this we're going to print a because there is a string but if you were to change this to none none is considered false in python and also if you have an empty string it's also considered as false in python so nothing will be printed and just to prove that nothing will be printed we can go ahead and say executed because printing nothing of course will print nothing so if we rerun this you'll see that we will have nothing executed and this is using the concept of truthy and falsey because there's some things that python considers true and some things that python considers false an empty string is something that it considers false for example now there's actually a lot of different things that python considers as falsey so i'm going to go ahead and paste in what i had from earlier so we can go through this one by one it's just a conceptual video so it doesn't really matter but it's just going to demonstrate that some things in python are considered false and these are the most popular examples an empty list is considered as false so if you do a check on that you're going to get false as a return because the list is empty the same thing goes for a tuple a set an empty string an empty range and also numbers that evaluate to zero are considered false not to mention that zero is actually a constant in python that is used for the boolean so false and zero are essentially the same thing and the same thing goes for true and one and we can actually demonstrate this by typing in print false is equal to zero and if we run this script we're going to get true as a return and we can do the same thing for true so we type in true is equal to one we'll get a return of true now let's go back to what we had earlier so what i had earlier was a check so if there is something in the empty tuple it's going to print true or else it's going to print false and just by running this script you'll see it's going to print false because the tuple is empty but as soon as we insert an element it's going to change to true immediately and this is valid for everything here such as if zero int is zero it's going to print false otherwise if it has a number it's going to print true so since zeroind is zero it's considered false and it's going to print false so the concept itself is quite simple if it is empty or if it is a value that is considered empty like zero it's going to evaluate two false so anything that's empty will evaluate to false and that also goes for values that are called none such as this over here if we go ahead and check if none is none it's going to evaluate to false because none contains nothing which means it's considered false and again this is a very important concept because it can save you a lot of trouble with creating checks such as if empty list actually contains something you can choose to do something with the empty list you can say this list contains and then you can pass in the empty list else you can say the list is empty and if we run this we're going to get that the list is empty because there's nothing inside it but as soon as we go ahead and say something like mario and luigi is inside the list it's going to print this list contains mario and luigi but that's actually all i wanted to cover in today's lesson so as always guys thanks for watching and i'll see you in the next lesson
