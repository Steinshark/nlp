and there are hundreds of thousands of crosses on this place and it was a stunning experience to be there it was one of these places as soon as you walk in you feel like you must be quiet just immediately you must be quiet and as we were walking you're going to hear this you're going to hear hear this on the documentary in a couple of episodes um so father ginterest who is one of the priests the priest really who showed us around almost the whole country he said as we were walking around he says you know when people place their crosses here some are happy because they're celebrating something you know sometimes they put one because a child was born or baptized or something like that sometimes they're sad they're remembering someone who's departed or they're praying for something that they're really worrying about he says walking around here and seeing all the names and all of these languages on these hundreds of thousands of crosses he says this is almost like hearing what God hears and as you look around you see all these prayers that are ascending and you actually can read them this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so hello everyone I am very happy to be here with Father Andrew damic and Richard Roland and I father I always pronounce your name wrong which I'm sorry and I just realized it did it again and uh but you know I love you uh and for people that watch the channel you are used to seeing them here uh I feel like we are in some ways uh partners in crime although we're not committing a crime we're helping to restore a certain way of seeing and a certain way of participating in reality and so Father Andrew and Richard went together on a trip to Lithuania to document you know the the relationship between Orthodoxy and the Deep stories that exist in Lithuania so I am excited I haven't yet listened to the to the the podcast I have to confess but I'm excited too it's called The Wolf on the cross an Orthodox Christian pilgrimage in Lithuanian the first episode is already out the wolf Lithuania before the cross and so Father Andrew and Richard I mean you start with Father Andrew what possessed you to make us to make something like this uh there are so many reasons that I went to Lithuania um but for me probably the first one is that my great-grandparents were from there and so um Lithuanian language and culture were not in any way passed down within my family it was erased essentially after one in one generation and so for me it was a kind of a question mark in my own family's history and um over the last 10 15 years or so I've been sort of trying to fill in what that question mark means for me um and you know one of the things that I discovered along the way is well there's actually a seven or eight hundred year history of Orthodox Christianity in Lithuania and so that really sort of doubled or tripled my desire to go there and to connect with not just my family's history but also the story of that place and the story of my brothers and sisters in Christ uh in that place and we found it's really fascinating actually um yeah so it started with my great-grandparents but then so many so many reasons yeah so were your ancestors Orthodox or do you know um so my great-grandfather was Catholic and my great-grandmother was Lutheran which is a relatively a rare thing in Lithuania most most people are Catholics but my great-grandmother was from a I think I'm not certain actually she was from a culture that was essentially a German culture in Lithuania that existed for a long time and it became lithuanianized yeah um so her last name was was Germanic but probably was altered in a Lithuanian way and she always said to Lithuanian was her first language and so Richard why so what would why did you go what made you want to go on this trip as well um well actually it sort of started as a joke um father Father Andrew was like uh you know I'm thinking about going to Lithuania next year and almost as a joke I was like well let me know I'll go with you and uh you know then you know a year later he's like so I'm going to lithium you know how serious were you you know you know and so uh so I went along to help make the documentary Carrie father Andrew's bags that kind of thing but uh but uh actually really I think there were a couple of things one is um I mean heck Europe is where the history is from you know and so I've been doing this Universal history thing with you Jonathan for well over a year now I think actually I think it's maybe maybe like two years like I don't however long since our first video I don't even know but uh we've been doing this thing for a while and um and so this was just an opportunity to kind of go over there and I've always been interested in the Baltic states in particular and in that culture um for a couple of reasons one is because it is the it's the geographical meeting of east and west uh which is the sort of uh the spiritual and cultural place that I find myself in my life right right at this kind of place where uh East and West come together obviously being a western person but being a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church um and trying to navigate those things and figure some of those things out Lithuania is the actual embodiment of all of that um and and also it's I don't know there's a really interesting thing kind of going on in in uh in Lithuania that is present I would say in Celtic culture specifically like a Celtic Christian culture as well which is the way in which uh they were able to kind of integrate their uh their kind of mythical Pagan past um and even you know like certain artistic motifs um you know there's the you know the Celtic cross you know you can find Celtic crosses in Ireland from before the time of Christianity um they were the Celts were already making crosses Christianity just came along and explained why you know and uh the same kind of things going on in Lithuania so you have you know the belt Baltic Sun Cross which is like this you know ancient kind of pagan symbol and when Christianity came along uh we said hey no problem actually this is uh is you know crosses or a specialty of ours let's put Jesus on it and uh now that's probably one of the most recognizably specifically Lithuanian things and then um you know finally uh finally it was just an opportunity to kind of to the uh you know being in the Orthodox Church in America my particular parish and my particular you know the tradition that I'm in within the Orthodox Church is you know from a very uh what used to be called ruthenian background right um but ruthenia is this land that uh once encompassed much of what uh today is modern day Ukraine and and Belarus and and um up into Lithuania proper and uh so in that sense it was kind of a way to go to the lands that you know my uh my spiritual ancestors if not my um you know my my physical ones as far as I know I have no Lithuanian ancestors although it's quite probable some of my ancestors may have invaded Lithuania at some point but I tried or tried right yeah yeah um but uh but it uh but it was a place an opportunity to kind of go to the place where this uh where my spiritual ancestors are from and there's a a particular connection to an icon of the mother of God there that's related to all that which maybe we'll talk about in a minute so wow so so you're made how many of us Nine episodes is that is that my understanding that's that's the current plan is for Nine episodes and nine like two hour episodes basically so you you discovered a lot of things there so what what what was like what what's the driving fourth like what is the thing that really made you curious and excited I think um there's a lot of pieces of Lithuanian history including Lithuanian Orthodox history that are he's really to the history of um of Europe and of the Orthodox Church right so I'll just give a couple of brief examples um one major element of Orthodox Christian history that shaped uh even a lot of American Orthodox history is what's often referred to as the union and that was that was the term at the time you know so a union between some Orthodox dioceses and the Roman Catholic Church and um this became a turning point in Orthodox history especially European Orthodox history Well that took place in what locally they called The Commonwealth of two Nations but in English sources it's usually called the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and the vast majority of that was in lands that either at the time did or shortly before belongs to the Grand duchy of Lithuania and so there were lithuanians some of whom were Lithuanian speaking and some of whom were ruthenian speaking but identified culturally as Lithuanian or maybe we're polish speaking but identified as Lithuanian who were deeply involved in the Union uh and many who were deeply involved in resisting the Union uh there are Saints Orthodox Saints from that period who were involved in resisting the unions for instance saint athanasius of breast um you know the so this is the Union is called the union of breast and breast is a place that was part of the grand duchy of Lithuania at the time so that's that's one element and you know connected to that and this is something that I think probably a lot of American Orthodox Christians are not aware of um you know we have this common greeting especially in Orthodox churches that are uh Slavic background where people say glory to Jesus Christ Glory forever right and I can't remember how to say the other one in uh yeah um so that greeting actually is originally as Lithuanian so they would say glory to Jesus Christ and then they would respond with amen which means forever amen and this is the way that all lithuanians greeted each other up to World War II you mean they greet each other just like yeah on the street in the street basically wow yeah this was not a church thing yeah this was just a Lithuania thing and so uh when the union happened that greeting of course which was old even by that point so you know this greeting is centuries upon centuries old um it gets into the Union because these people just keep living the way they live and greeting each other the way they always did and then you know when many people of uh also this group is called Greek Catholics even though they're not ethnically Greek or linguistic or Greek when many Greek Catholics immigrate to the United States they bring that greeting along with them and of course many of those uh converted to Orthodoxy in the early 20th century late 19th early 20th century at the same time there were groups back in Europe who did the same thing formerly Greek Catholic churches that became Orthodox again um and the greetings stuck uh it's it's not actually a Russian Orthodox greeting yeah it is a greeting that comes from Lithuania but is part of the grand duchy part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and um so if you say that to someone in Russia they may not know how to respond to you because they've never heard that before right um so it becomes part of Orthodox Christian culture here in America But ultimately has its um Origins there there was a moment that we uh a a Sunday evening where we went to a home in a village there and uh uh the the parents of the the wife of one of the priests who is hosting us and he said uh now when you meet her parents if you really want to greet them in a in a beautiful way that they will recognize as very respectful and very Christian you should say this and I said well what does that mean and he tells me I was like wait a minute I know this greeting you know he says he says yeah uh all lithuanians said this up until basically Nazis and Soviets invaded and that's amazing push that out and then now you get good morning good day yeah yeah it's funny because I it's funny because that we don't have that greeting in in our Parish because it's a french-speaking parish it has a different maybe a different line and I remember the first time I I mean a few the few first times I wasn't used to it right standing in front of a of a priest and he says Glory Jesus Christ and I just look at him and and it's like I'm this idiot that doesn't know how to respond to the greeting but I learned to uh in time so so Richard I I wanted to ask you in terms of our Universal history so yeah I'm sure you discovered or found ways that the the Lithuanian culture connects and so we want to hear about that yes and so uh Father Andrew has graciously assigned me a lot of the more uh uh medieval history portions of the of the documentary as well as uh writing a lot of the Legends um one of the interesting things that I think people will enjoy about this documentary uh at least symbolic World folks is the way in which the um will have legends about like the early Lithuanian Grand Dukes for instance and then also uh the the the the the um hegeography of the early Lithuanian Martyrs um so that you get this in episode one but those events uh both happen within a generation of each other and so when I uh when I kind of wrote those those Legends wrote that hagiography and the way that we kind of put it together you get one at the beginning of the episode one towards the end of the episode but they're done by the same voice actor and they're written in the same style and so the point is actually to kind of show the continuity of of time and of history and of the world from the you know the legend of the Iron Wolf which is this let uh uh Pagan Lithuanian legend about the founding of the city of illness um and then a generation later The Passion of The Three Holy Martyrs of illness and that those two things kind of flows together naturally in a way that shows how so shows how things like the Pagan histories of our past as well as uh the stories of the christianization and specifically the way that that's embodied in the lives of the Saints and also in the stories that surround these these many wonderworking icons of the mother of God that you'll find in Lithuania the way that these things just form a kind of a continuous stream so that's one thing that I'm really excited about in the documentary um another thing that's really interesting is just the way in which uh uh the grand duchy of Lithuania and then the United polish Lithuanian Commonwealth turns out to have been very important in a lot of European history in ways that uh the the version of history that many of us grew up with which was you know a little light on the Middle Ages to begin with um and then if you did get anything it would be mainly from like a French and French and English that's an English perspective that's right yeah specifically about how the English are better than French or in my case the opposite in your case the opposite um actually yeah I mean this is not related to anything at all but one day we will do Universal history video about Joan of Arc um uh which I'm pretty uh who I'm very interested in but uh of course growing up I was told she was the villain really like can you believe wow can you believe that yeah well I didn't I didn't think that's even possible how can you think that first of all obviously people don't hear from Saints and Angels yeah of course yeah that's right but there's that but also she was French so yeah so that's that's better than that it's a double whammy she was a girl a lot of whammys there yeah anyway but uh that aside um one of the one of the uh I'll just give another example that's like a really weird thing so if you grew up in any kind of like a h Evangelical um uh fundamentalist sort of reformed kind of that uh stream that trajectory uh you probably I mean like for instance the churches I grew up in had a Reformation Day celebration every year uh we wouldn't celebrate All Saints Day you know don't be crazy but instead we would celebrate Reformation day um uh as sort of like a a replacement holiday for Halloween actually celebrate on the same day oh really yeah we'd have a big party people would dress up uh people would dress up as like famous reformers and um um we actually had a girl one year that came in a pickle barrel uh uh like had a which is a specific reference to the the stuff that happened in the life of Martin Luther and um uh he he married this at this uh this ex-nun uh who's and by smuggling her out of a Convent in a pickle Barrel so yeah yeah anyway wacky times wacky times truly wacky stuff like if you think about uh symbolism of everything going on there but uh one of the things that we you know they would do is they talk about all the like the early sort of people they consider to be proto-reformers uh among whom was a an important Hungarian uh religious leader named Jan Huss yeah John John Hudson in English and um uh well it turns out uh by the way Yahoo is not a not a Protestant um the big thing that he was kind of fighting for was uh for um uh we'll probably talk about him in Universal history at some point too because he's really interesting but the bit one of the big things that he was fighting for was for the uh uh the reception of the Eucharist in both kinds um in fact the hussite fashion uh fact that the hussite faction who was a big you know real really a stickler for this we were called the utra quit utrequests you know that are from the Latin like meaning both kinds right yeah so uh at this point in Western Europe there was a common practice to only commune people in the body and not in the blood and only once a year and this is actually the main beef that the hussites had so you know it's there they weren't quite Baptist you could say um but uh so anyway but the hussites were not just a religious movement they were a major political movement um and what most people do not know I actually know this until very recently as I was researching stuff for the second episode is that um they wanted their own kingdom and they wanted their own King and so they actually invited the grand Grand Duke vitotas who was the you know the he's called the great he's one of the main people who really tried you know centuries before the before the union he really tried to uh see if he could unite eastern and western Christianity um he's a very interesting figure but they actually invited him to the hussites actually invited him to be their King you know because they wanted to have a Christian Catholic King over them but but not the king of Hungary who they weren't getting along with at the time so anyway all of this stuff is just hugely interesting um and a lot of the a lot of the major uh political figures uh that show up especially in the history of the 14th and 15th century in the grand duchy of Lithuania and Poland eventually Kingdom of Poland eventually become you know uh married into or involved in all of the most important dynastic struggles that happen in the late Middle Ages so um you know Lithuania is has although we don't know much about it it has a strong like it just has a strong presence or kind of Invisible Presence to us and the history of Europe yeah and I think the reason why there's probably several reasons but I think one of the big reasons why that's the case is because at the end of the 18th century the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth gets divided up between three different Empires and Poland and Lithuania as separate countries cease to exist right so you get the Russian Empire takes a chunk and gets Lithuania basically yeah um the prussians and then the austro-hungarian Empire they each get their own chunks and so like one of the things that that we we get as a result if we especially as Orthodox Christians living in North America is the conversation about Orthodox Christians who lived in those lands is largely from the point of view of Russia who kind of subsumed that that region at the end of the 18th century and had been kind of in competition with it for a while up to that um and so as a result the the point of view of people who lived in that area is is largely largely gone and sometimes is kind of denigrated as being like a peasant culture or whatever like another example is for instance is the practice of holy supper which is very common amongst many Orthodox Christians that they do on Christmas Eve holy supper was uh is a practice of the former polish Lithuanian Commonwealth celebrated by Catholics by Orthodox by Protestants and still to this day in if you were to sort of draw a map of eastern Europe and put dots where everybody's celebrating holy supper you would essentially see a map of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth over Christmas with uh somebody who is uh polish Catholic by um just you know culturally he's not practicing or anything but he says oh yes well we pulls we celebrate Christmas actually on Christmas Eve and he what he was talking about was holy supper like that's the that's the Christmas celebration you know we don't actually do anything on Christmas day it's like well it's not exactly correct but but it's just like that that memory of the Holy supper was you know like still very very uh potent for him yeah that's interesting I didn't I like it's funny because my wife is from Slovakia and she says that Christmas is the 24th and I'm like Chris is not the 24th this is the 25th it's like well in my country we celebrated on the 24th and like it there I'm saying it's Christmas Eve you're celebrating Christmas we have this fight like every 20 something you know 24 years you've had this fight yeah actually is probably doing something at home with her family having to do with a particular meal the night before and it was like that's because that area was part of this Commonwealth that's super interesting Slovakia so so it's almost like Lithuania is a kind of Easter egg especially for orthodox Christians kind of hidden in everything yeah you know so what is the state of the what is the state let's say of of Orthodoxy today in Lithuania what is it what did you find there so um there is a Russian diocese Russian Orthodox Diocese of Lithuania right now and this diocese arises really in the 19th century with a whole bunch of Greek Catholics becoming Orthodox um which from one point of view was a sort of a mass conversion movement from another point of view involved a lot of government pressure um both are probably true at the same time so that's the origin of the modern diocese there are about 50 or 60 parishes in the country somewhere around a hundred thousand or so people identify themselves as being Orthodox Christians but only about two or three thousand are actually in church on a regular basis okay um so uh but there are a number of centuries-old churches there and some incredible shrines um for instance the the reliquary of the three Martyrs of Vilnius in the Holy Spirit Monastery uh their relics have been incorrupt for 675 years and we actually came home with relics of these three Martyrs so if you're anyone's in eastern Pennsylvania come to Emmaus and you can venerate probably the only relics of these Saints on the continent very likely um and so what about what about the are there traces of the Greek Catholic or the the the Orthodox let's say a smell of Orthodoxy in Lithuanian Catholicism still or has it been completely subsumed by as a matter of fact yes uh probably the most obvious way is that they have there are a number of the Wonder working icons Lithuania which are in Catholic hands right when you look at it it's an Orthodox icon and it's often mounted up behind a Catholic Altar um and they're they're venerated by both Orthodox and Catholics and one of them which of course is the one that I know Richard is itching could talk about our lady of the Gate of the Dawn actually has a beast day on the Orthodox calendar and that's the day after Christmas so I have prepared some visual aids Father Andrew one moment so our lady of the Gate of the Dawn while Richard is fetching the whatever he's getting I'm sure he has a copy of it yeah I'm sure it is um is sort of the national icon of Lithuania and uh it is in a gate um so you can walk through the gate and then up above the gate there's a chapel and that's and that Chapel hosts the icon and it is a stunning icon it is an icon of the mother of God essentially as she's described or as the church is described because we know these are basically the same thing yeah in Revelation chapter 12. a woman clothed in the sun with the moon beneath her feet oh yeah oh I know that icon of course round with 12 stars but this is this isn't Lithuania this is it yes yes yes yes yes yes wow so this particular icon which uh First shows up in vilness in maybe the 13th or 14th century um very old probably uh you know from somewhere in the East uh but nobody really knows for sure right um um it's put over the dawn gate of the city of illness to protect it from Invaders and the dawn gate is one of the few of the original medieval uh Gates I think the only one yeah I was illness which still stands to this day um and so there's a beautiful Chapel up on top of the gate now where you can go and see the icon and venerate it uh the actual thing is huge oh how besides it's the size of like a wall I mean really massive um and of course and it has this beautiful or I mean it has this this like this sort of like the silver Risa over it right but it's um but yeah it's the original icon is massive I mean um I've got a picture of myself standing next to it it's probably five or five feet across maybe maybe six feet tall yes about right yeah and so is it is it is the reason it's like the image you showed us is that when you see or is there another reason on top of it so uh this this is this is like a kind of uh uh you know just like a a printing with like kind of a like gold foil or or whatever over it yeah and it's um so the the Riza covers actually pretty much everything but the face I think oh not even the hands it covers it doesn't cover doesn't cover the hands yeah it doesn't cover the hands but if you look at the uh original version of the icon which is under the Riza which I mean you can find pictures of this online I'm about to show you one but um you'll you'll notice if you're in Eastern Orthodox Christian especially in the kind of the Slavic tradition in North America you'll notice that it Bears a deep similarity to an icon which Saint seraphim of sarov uh had in his cell so this is a copy of that icon and uh you can see it's basically the same image it shows the mother of God there's no moon here but it shows the mother of god with their hands folded over her chest yeah um insane seraphim's icon there is wording as there is in this one in Halo around the Mother of God's had that in slavonic is the refrain from the acaf him Rejoice oh and what it bride so you know the the icon became very popular especially throughout the whole Grand duchy of Lithuania the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth and so many copies were made um and it's generally believed that when Saint seraphim I think visited Kiev at one point that he was given a copy while he was there and so this is another like I said a kind of another Lithuanian Easter egg that exists for orthodox Christians and uh you know Saint seraphim in many icons is actually depicted praying in front of an icon while he's kneeling on the Rock there's an icon sometimes in a Cell sometimes uh nailed to a tree and it's if you look closely it is our lady of the Gate of the dawn like there's just no question this is that icon so the the the the icon itself is quite unusual in terms of Eastern icons most eastern icons of the mother of God show her holding the child yeah um and of course the the kind of lore that's grown up around this icon in this uh Slavic tradition is that it depicts the mother of God at the moment of the Annunciation with her sort of her hands fold on her chest in prayer her head bowed she's giving her a scent yeah that makes sense I mean it does look like the pose that she takes in the Annunciation icon right yes and so um uh but the kind of the story about how Saint Sarah from got that particular icon is that uh when he was uh when he was a young man before he was seraphim or a saint he uh he went to the uh the Kia of labra uh the great lava at Kiev to get a blessing to become a monk and he goes there uh and the Elder there do you remember her her name Father Andrew no I don't oh I'm sure he'll tell the story in the documentary I I will tell the story in the documentary and people can we'll get them for the full version we'll watch the documentary I'm spacing out right now but uh the whole the Elder there at the at the Key of lava at the time uh was one of these Saints who is a a woman who disguised herself as a man and became a monk and is living you know in the cell there at the lava so at the time it was you know he and people didn't find out until after after her death yeah you know and uh but so Saint Sarah from goes to this this woman she was from a uh she's from a kind of a noble family with connections to uh Belarus uh which is uh where this particular icon Our Lady of the Gate of the Dawn is um is very popular and very revered and so um it seems um and this has been the theory of a couple of historians of iconography that I've talked to about this the theory is that uh that uh Steven probably was given the this Icon by this this holy Elder when he was at the Key of lava and got a blessing to go to sarav and become a monk um and probably brought it with him from there and so um and so it's got this kind of deep connection of course seeing seraphim is the uh is the the patron of my Parish but also my own personal patron saint and so this particular icon has been you know as you can see many years ago I actually even before I was Orthodox I commissioned this copy of it from an iconographer in St Petersburg and it's been you know kind of um you know definitely my favorite icon of the mother of God and really personally significant to uh to my life and my prayer life and uh so so you know for me going to see the the icon of Our Lady of the gay of the Dawn this was a it was a big deal yeah and it's it's extremely beloved throughout Lithuania every single Catholic Church you go to and every single Orthodox Church you go to has a copy somewhere we were told even we were told even although there's there's only maybe you know a very small handful of Protestant churches in Lithuania but we were told that you know even even in some of those you can see um I guess the only two Protestant churches we went into were they didn't have one up but uh we were told that even especially like Lutheran parishes often yeah we'll have one and if you go to Lithuanian cemeteries which are a fascinating place to begin with uh you will see this icon on many tombstones it's I mean she's just everywhere in Lithuania everywhere well so if if we wanted to actually talk about two things real quick that I think uh if you want to say like are important to me to kind of the symbolism of Lithuania and that people will be hearing about more in the documentary um one thing would be the cemeteries and the other thing that I would really like to talk about is the is the sort of weird uh uh in many ways kind of abortive attempt to reconstruct Baltic paganism in Lithuania no that's happening now let's say there's been that's right yeah there's a neopagan movement there called room of uh um which is um it's it's and what they do is they take so so just as with almost any Pagan is a European paganism there are no sources there are no first-hand sources from actual Baltic pagans uh instead what you get is stuff that's survived in folklore a lot of weird syncretistic stuff yeah a bunch of mushrooms and Jung yeah right exactly and in their case often they would mix in stuff from uh Hinduism really because because yes because so so uh you know both Indian culture and Lithuanian culture are Indo-European cultures oh yeah so that's stretching and have a well they have there's a linguistic connection between the two so Lithuanian is actually one of the most archaic Indo-European languages and so as a result many people have seen lots and lots of very obvious cognates with Sanskrit you're right um and so as a result then there's this kind of feeling like well the ancient Indians the ancient lithuanians were kind of maybe sort of doing the same thing religiously which is just hilarious yeah it is many thousands of years are we talking about here a lot yeah a lot of thousands of years wow that's that's wild but I mean most of the way that Lithuanian paganism has kind of survived in Lithuania is not through this neo-pagan movement which is only just a few thousand people at best okay um but rather it's it's it's the the survival of Legends that have become if not explicitly christianized they have become Christian friendly I mean basically basically uh mythology turning into fairy tales right exactly like a a great example and you'll hear this in the first episode is the The Legend of the Iron Wolf which is a pagan story happening with pagans and includes a pagan priest interpreting a pagan uh you know uh Duke's dream right and yet in very Christian Lithuania the Iron Wolf is everywhere in Vilnius it's one of the symbols of the Armed Forces but there's no sense of like secretism to it at all uh the the sort of the fangs of of paganism have been completely removed yeah but I mean it's like that's what Richard and I have been exploring for the past several months that you see the same you know in in Byzantine culture they had kept the the Greek uh the Greek plays they they had kept you know Homer they they would read these it was part of their kind of common imagery comment culture but but there was a hierarchy and that's I think that's that's the way to understand it that there's there's a proper hierarchy these stories can often survive as kind of you know as Folk and and common things that we hold in common yeah I know Richard you're going to mention cemeteries this is something that I think is really worth talking about yeah yeah so I'll come to that in a second I wanna I do want to share like one little detail I'm gonna actually share one of the things that Father Andrew wasn't there for oh um it's true yeah uh so we went to we went out to uh uh during the trip we went out to the city of Carlos which is up near the uh the Baltic are you thinking of clip I don't know why I said conus is in the middle yeah I've been I've been just like looking at these names while I write this episode until my my eyes get crossed yes thank you all these names that start with k it's true there's a bunch so we won't have to claipita uh which is a city there by the Baltic and then one and then uh took a ferry across to this long spit of land it's actually made up of a number of Dunes um uh what are called parabolic Dunes they're basically giant sand dunes that get up and walk every once in a while and uh in fact the ones on uh on this uh this this land formation called the cronians pit uh they're actually um uh some of them are named after like The Villages that they have swallowed you know over the centuries which is pretty awesome and a really beautiful place I mean truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever been in my life um one of the interesting things about it was the uh uh you know we went to a place there uh called the hill of witches um so the hill of witches was one of these things that was kind of bought and paid for by the Soviets as like a way of trying to undermine Catholicism Lithuania more or less right right uh so basically it's this hill and these Trails like these hiking trails and you go up and uh the word that's being translated as which in English really means like it can mean like fairy but also like demon or imp or something like this but it's basically mythological folklore figures like yeah a character from folklore yeah and um and uh and and so they there are these sort of like uh carvings and statues of all these different figures done in kind of a traditional Lithuanian mode um and so these aren't I mean they're not objects of worship there aren't you know nobody comes up there and offers sacrifices or there's no altars up there yeah yeah but it was it definitely uh uh it definitely felt like this very sort of weird uh this weird kind of wild liminal sort of a space um and so we had a great time hiking and everything and then uh Father Andrew I think went back to the hotel and um or did you go back to the hotel or just go somewhere to rest so we went to that Hill uh together it was the day before that you went somewhere else on the spit if I recall or maybe the day after but but in any case in any case um I think it was the day after because we went uh the next morning we got up we went swimming in the in the in the sea and then um and then we took this this no maybe it was after anyway I it's okay I was very jet lagged at that point we were very liminal space you came back right to remember things as they happen so it was really interesting because we it was the evening it was the evening and uh we were making our way on this long hike up to the top of the Dooms so you can hike up to the top of the dunes and look over them over the border into kaliningrad which is technically part of Russia the kalinograd oblast um and um it's funny because I was at the I was in an airport the other you know a couple months ago but I was telling somebody about the coronian spit just like a random person in the airport uh because this is what it's like to travel with me and um and uh this this girl turns around and her eyes get real big and she says I'm from kalitting grad he's like nobody knows about this anyway it was it was a it was kind of a neat meeting but um anyway so we're hiking up these dunes and um I mean really beautiful kind of a silent uh Forest so it's all on Sand and you know how like after a snowfall everything is kind of hushed because the snow is kind of sucking up all the sound exactly like that but no snow yeah right so there's just hush all you can really hear is the crunch of the sand under your feet you're in this Pine Forest I told somebody you know if a uh if a white stag ran across the path right now I would not be surprised yeah uh so we make it up to the top of the the dunes um actually while we're hiking up there's like somebody like some some neo-pagan group somewhere in the woods is like they're they're doing something right and so they're they're beating drums and like the drums are like the only thing you can hear in the forest and you know it's way off in the distance it was very eerie and we made it up to the top of the dunes and they have this they built this massive Sundial at the top of the largest Dune there um and the Sundial is um it's weird because it uses a bunch of Norse runes which are maybe not quite you know which are different yeah maybe for Lithuania but all paganism is runes all right I know look there's Norse people right across the Baltic Sea well I know there certainly were you know Norse people in Lithuania at various points but but I mean this wasn't being done to make historical reference they were trying to do this to make it a little like seem like sort of like vaguely neopic and uh massive Sundial up at the top of the dunes um so it was it was a very interesting place and I'm I'm you know as we're getting getting towards that part of the documentary I'm still kind of like mulling over the experience there because uh you know uh definitely in in what is overwhelming the you know a Christian place right uh there is uh uh there are these like little bits of uh I don't know how to say like fairies hanging out in the corners right in a usually in a I think at a pretty harmless way but um you know just connecting this to some of the other Universal history uh discussions that we've had and I know there are other places in the world that are like this as well but it was really strange and at times very intense to kind of come into contact with this so yeah the other thing that we'll mention real quick were the uh the graveyards which were absolutely incredible um here in the US I don't know how things are in Canada land but here in the US uh graveyards are um just sort of like mass-produced rows on rows of headstones they're all the same there's nothing really particularly beautiful or sacred about them it's more like how can we if pack as many people into these spaces as efficiently as possible yeah and I think the further you get away from like the East Coast the more that seems to be the case yeah I think you're right I think you're right we have some good old cemeteries here in Emmaus Pennsylvania but still there they do not compare to Lithuanian cemeteries if you go out into the countryside uh even here in Texas going to East Texas which is where I'm from there are some some like nice old you know Church graveyards um but generally speaking there are a bunch of generic rest land flower land you know or accepting land right yeah and just like seas and seas of of uh indistinguishable headstones yeah when we were in Lithuania we visit we ended up peering over the wall of a couple of cemeteries but there's one in particular that we went to and we scoured it and that's because we went to the hometown of my great grandfather and which is called kudirko's namistis which is way on the western edge of Lithuania right next to the the Russian part the kalini oblast which traditionally by the way that land that that oblast that is belongs to Russia now it's disconnected from the main body of Russia traditionally that's called Lithuania minor so it belonged to Lithuania back in the day at various points in history um so kudukus Nemesis is right up against that border and there's a little river that separates the two and um we started walking through that Cemetery which thank God is not a huge Cemetery um and we were looking for my ancestors because I knew that a bunch had been buried there I Found Records indicating that but I I didn't know exactly where and after some time you know thank goodness we had someone along with us who read Lithuanian who was able to say this one says so my family's name you know this is funny you you begin by mispronouncing my name if I if my great-grandfather left it alone you might find it easier to say is our traditional name and so um the the priest who is guiding us that day father of Vladimir he's pointed at one particular one he says this says of the Jamaica family on it here in Lithuanian he said this is it and it is literally the place that my ancestors are were buried for Generations no one in my family uh the American branch of my family had been back in almost a hundred years yeah so are these the were they Stone monuments or were they these wooden crosses that we see like this image we have in Lithuania like these wooden wooden crosses and stuff we should talk about the Wooden Crosses in a second we will come to that in a second yeah yeah but no these are these are stone for the most part there were I guess a few wooden grave markers like really old traditional ones um and in fact uh one of the places we went to when we were on the cronian spit was to the we went to the the house of of Thomas mon a famous German novelist actually one of my favorite writers uh he wrote a really interesting novel on the life of Joseph um called the Young Joseph where Joseph and his brothers um super interesting I worth reading but uh but he wrote that a novel while he was living on this this house this really beautiful old kind of traditional uh German house that there were a lot of Germans who kind of settled in that particular part of Lithuania along the Baltic and so we went to his house and then after we went to his house there was a nearby Lutheran Church and so we went we looked at that and then um this is part Father Andrew wasn't there for I think and then we went to uh this old Lithuanian graveyard um Lutheran Lithuanian graveyard in this case but really uh really old-fashioned in that all of that the markers were these wooden crosses but there would be different kinds of crosses uh depending on um depending on you know who the person was and how old they were so that if you if you sort of knew like how to read the crosses you could say well this kind of cross for somebody who died when they were young just kind of cross for a mother Etc um and actually we found uh we found the grave Graves of two Orthodox Christians um in that graveyard while we were kind of looking around so they died there and we're buried there some time ago but um but most of the grave markers were uh were Stone in most of the cemeteries uh almost all of them I would say almost all but I'd say a good third if not half um had had this icon wow on it yeah wow yeah yeah and and one thing that really makes a Lithuanian grave different from most of the ones you see in North America and you see some in North America like this but almost all of them in Lithuania are like this is that the grave plot is outlined usually in stones or sometimes uh cement you know um to to Mark the border of it and then inside that border there is basically a small garden planted with lots of flowers and so forth and so uh when you walk through it instead of the graveyard being essentially taken care of by some company that owns the place and mows the lawn every single grave is immaculately cared for by family members and lithuanians will visit the graves of their family at least twice every year no matter where they live in the country now fortunately you can get from one corner of the country to the farthest Way Corner in about three and a half hours yeah so it's not hard you know to to do it but but they will go twice a year so they will go on the anniversary of that person's death and make sure that the grave is very well taken care of and they also go around November 1st and 2nd which is uh sort of a two-day holiday that they called velenis which is connected of course to the Catholic All Saints and All Souls day and if you go especially on those days you will see that there are candles on every single grave and so it's almost like there's a second City you know there's the one city where the living are and then there's this other city where the dead are wow um and it is a very very serious time for lithuanians um for veleness and uh they they're it's it's considered to be a a stain on your family if the graves of your family are neglected like it's a big shame you don't let that happen so Father Andrew what what do you hope to accomplish like with this documentary what is it that you were what is it that you want to bring to the world I guess um number one a bunch of stories that people have never heard that I think are going to be not just fascinating and entertaining in some cases but I hope edifying um one of the ways that I know how stuff that I make is is being received by the is by the email that we get and I tell people that uh with almond Soul which is the podcast that Richard and I do together we get the longest emails so Tolkien Fanatics you know sending us long multi-paragraph emails you know um and then and then with Lord of spirits which I do with Father Stephen DeYoung we get the weirdest emails uh deeply deeply weird many of them not all of them but but deeply but uh with the wolf on the cross we get the most heartfelt emails and it's been really interesting to me to see that because I thought okay well I care deeply about these stories will anyone else you know and uh I've heard actually from a bunch of Lithuanian Americans including some Orthodox clergy saying that they were in tears listening to what we were talking about but even people with no Lithuanian Heritage at all saying I've never heard this before and why did no one ever tell me and especially they were struck by the story of the Three Martyrs of illness which is just such a powerful powerful story and if you listen to that first episode number one Richard's writing is Top Notch so good job Richard in writing that story and then we also hired uh a voice actor named Brandon Talley and his performance is top notch and um one of the things you'll also hear this uh this documentary is very different from every other ancient Faith Radio podcast particularly not just in terms of the content but also the production value so not only you're going to hear you know the two of us uh telling stories and doing narration uh but you're also going to hear lots of of interviews that we recorded on site while we were in Lithuania you're going to hear voice actors you're going to hear ambient music that's as appropriate to whatever the story that's being told so for instance during the the the hagiography of the Three Holy Martyrs you're gonna hear this very epic adventurous sounding music because it's an epic tale but also even there's sound effects right so like we tell stories about battles and you hear battle sounds you know in connect with this and and honestly there is as far as I'm as far as I know there is no other Orthodox Christian Media in English podcasts like this with this kind of production work and so my hope is that people will feel that they are there with us that they are taking the the trip with us that they're on the pilgrimage with us like like another great example we talked about crosses um there's a very famous place there called the hill of crosses where people go on pilgrimage and they bring across all along their pilgrimage and then when they get there they place it and they will write the names of people on that cross that they want to pray for um and there are hundreds of thousands of crosses on this place and it was a stunning experience to be there was one of these places as soon as you walk in you feel like you must be quiet just immediately you must be quiet and as we were walking you're going to hear this you're going to hear hear this on the documentary in a couple of episodes um so father ginthrus who is one of the priests the priest really who showed us around almost the whole country he said as we were walking around he says you know when people place their crosses here some are happy because they're celebrating something you know sometimes they put one because a child was born or baptized or something like that sometimes they're sad they're remembering someone who's departed or they're praying for something that they're really worrying about he says walking around here and seeing all the names and all of these languages on these hundreds of thousands of crosses he says this is almost like hearing what God hears and as you look around you see all these prayers that are ascending and you actually can read them I should I should just note that it typically the way it works is somebody goes on a pilgrimage to the hill of crosses as we did you have a cross you write the names of the people that you want to pray for and then you carry it with you on your pilgrimage so you get to the hill of crosses where you plant it and then you and then you leave it there so there were I mean hundreds of thousands I think is too conservative and estimate especially since a lot of times you'd have a big cross and and there would be hundreds of rosaries just hung on it left there but yeah right so I mean you know if you wanted to count really all the crosses there including the small ones it'd have to be a million it's impossible yeah and and you know one of the things about this place so it's it's been hosting crosses probably for centuries now uh during the Soviet period the Soviets would go in and burn them down and and bulldoze them down um and yet in the middle of the night people would go out there and put their cross back and so it had the effect of this Forest getting burned down and then just springing up again regrowing overnight yeah and so it became a symbol of resistance to an atheist domination of the country of an occupation of of you know Soviet uh demonic evil and so one of the things that I want people to walk away from not just from this story of the hill of crosses you're going to hear it over and over again over and over again uh is this sense of Keeping the Faith and loving Christ in the midst of very difficult circumstances um you know Orthodox Christianity has been a minority in that country and throughout its entire history throughout the whole history Orthodoxy has been the minority it was never the state religion even when Grand Dukes were Orthodox which there's one that we know was there's one that was Catholic and then Orthodox and then Catholic again uh probably um and um but then even you know frankly you know our our Catholic friends suffered a lot hot under uh under Russian imperial Rule and under certainly absolutely under nazian Soviet rule in the late 20th century and and it is an extremely inspiring story uh to to hear about how these people kept their faith in the midst of this and um I mean it was amazing like we were walking around and people say oh yeah there was a Lenin statue over here we tore that one down you know um and so you know it's hard to think about that you know to to to to conceive of what it must be like yeah you have lived under that domination and then to come out and have this sense of solidarity and love like the Lithuania gained its independence from the Soviet Union through singing actually uh a singing Revolution which you're gonna hear that story towards the end so you know we don't want to spoil it so everybody go and check out the series The Wolf and the cross I am going to listen to the first episode you know by tomorrow morning and now you've got me all excited about it so thanks for your love and uh dedication to this project but also just to helping people ReDiscover the ancient stories how they connect together with our faith and so Father Andrew and Richard thanks for your time thank you very much for having us Jonathan
