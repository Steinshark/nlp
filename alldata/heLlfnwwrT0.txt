foreign welcome back to talk Tech with Tiff in this episode I sat down with Mike who is the founder of human scaffold we talked about all the difficult things when it comes to asking your boss for help or maybe there's some team member that you don't get along with he gave his advice and insight into how to make that more feasible also too I link down below my newsletter which is completely free so you can go sign up today all right let's dive into it welcome to my new series called talk Tech with tip where I am sitting down with industry professionals to hear about their career Journeys and current roles I created this series to hear from people who are established in the tech industry so that we can all learn what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs and the type of opportunities that are out there okay let's get started hi Mike how are you today I'm good Tiff how are you I'm good I am so excited I'm excited to be here me too I was just going to say that I'm excited because I feel like we've been speaking about getting you on the podcast for a while now and today the Stars aligned so I'm happy yeah it couldn't be a better day nice outside yeah I agree and also too you know we're gonna in a sec here dive into more about yourself and human scaffold but I think part of me is really excited to have you on because myself and uh Paul actually went through one of your how would you call it workshops or uh yeah we do those behavioral assessments yeah yeah so we got to go through that and make your relationship stronger it may it made us Bond deeper I feel no but it's really it does tell us that's why he's like that exactly yeah it does it tells you a lot about yourself and then also to your partner or you know most I I know typically it's with colleagues and it's just so important so I'm really excited to to dive into it today yeah excellent but before we do so tell me a little bit about yourself you have a really interesting career background and what led you to really starting human scaffold yeah we'll start it all back in the 90s yeah way back when way back when um yeah I started in Pharma in sales I was one of those guys that carried a bank around and you know you were waiting for an hour to see your doctor and then I would walk in and see the doctor and then you would give me dirty looks on the way out right um so I did that for a number of years and that's where I met Paul actually um we were roommates another podcast maybe that's for the Paul and Tiff um podcast that could be a whole episode yeah golly even more maybe and then um I decided um at that point I was interested in training but I didn't know if I wanted to go that path from a corporate standpoint actually all the people that moved to that office got divorced they were just kind of like dry or you said the worst um they got divorced oh divorce I thought you said the worst I was like they got divorced which was the worst that is the worst yeah so um so I thought my wife was a teacher and I thought well maybe I would be interested in becoming a high school teacher so I went back to school became a high school teacher went to Teachers College and I did that for 10 years and during that time it was pretty cool I'm a science I have a science background so I did that um but then I got into all kinds of other things Co-op and math and geography and drama which we can get to later yeah I learned a lot from that experience yeah and then a friend called me out of the blue and uh said would you ever think of coming back to Pharma and I did and so I came back to Pharma I went back to Pharma and at that time I got into management I wanted to try a different thing so as a product manager got into marketing and sales manager and then I had this really good idea just before the pandemic hey I'll start my own business yeah um and it was really good for two months in January yeah and then March it hit and so that of course kind of you know sent me on another trajectory where I did a lot more research and ended up to where I am now with human scaffold wow what was what was the uh business model before you said two months and then covet kind of hit what was the biz what was it initially the business model was like in-person workshops okay yeah like getting in and um at first I wasn't sure you know whether I was going to do a lot more team building because what got me into it was um my whole life I've just managed to get along with people and then yet there was others that didn't get along with other people yet they would connect with me and I would connect with the other person but how come they didn't connect together so I always was interested in that and so as time went on I wanted to I knew I wanted to start my own business one day and I wasn't sure what that would be so then I thought well it'll be kind of cool to start a business and um try to make that happen in the workplace and help people to be um get along better because I really believe that if that happens then you could be more productive more efficient serve your clients or your customers or your patients or whomever it is better right so um so it really allowed me to research more and then do virtual work which I probably would have not thought was ideal for team building but it turns out it is so it's now it was I guess no pain no gain right yeah exactly exactly and then now even though you know everything's quote unquote back to normal it still feels like a lot of companies are virtual or have really embraced that so are most of your workshops and coaching sessions are they virtual still yeah I'd say half and half but in the past year what's happened is um when people will connect with me they'll say hey let's I really want to do something in person would you be willing to travel or would you come to to us or what does that look like so um I find now that I use a bit of a hybrid um so I'll use videos ahead of time to try and introduce a concept so that when we do get together it's all interactive I create scenarios and this kind of stuff I know I wanted to make an appearance uh well that's great so it's kind of a hybrid right now yes yeah and I think it'll be like that moving forward because I really believe that in the in a workshop the more that we can actually be working together working in groups like this morning I spent the entire morning working on a retreat a week-long retreat yeah so it's pretty cool because the the person that I'm working with is really open-minded and wants to create like a psychological safety with their group and really make them feel comfortable to come together so um yeah it's really fun I guess that's my ideal client someone that wants to push push the needle forward rather than just you know I guess my non-ideal client would be someone who's like yeah I'm not going to participate in the workshop just fix the team and I'll be back in an hour want a coffee yeah yeah just fix this here yeah fix that and I don't want to yeah if these people don't like me and I don't like them but yeah darn it we're gonna do a good job they're the ones who need fixing actually yes exactly all right well we're kind of we're speaking about what what human scaffold does at a high level but for those who are not as familiar with human scaffold give us a little bit of uh background on on what it is um the name um scaffold when I was in Teachers College I had this big moment where I um I I learned about this uh psychologist a Russian psychologist named Lev vygotsky who came up with this idea of the zone of proximal development I promise I won't go that much deep into there than this but um it kind of sets up to what I I like to accomplish um it's that idea that you have someone who who knows something and then someone who that same person may not know something else right so the zone of proximal development is that point where um the individual is learning and pushing themselves to understand more right and so the teacher then plays the role of being a facilitator in trying to push them up towards it and being like almost like a scaffold to help push them up the the ladder of knowledge so to speak so I thought yeah that'd be kind of cool because that's my philosophy of of how I think is a great way to learn you create your own learning and you have the person be there the teacher to help them along so that's why I created the the company and how we do it right so they then you know when I first got in I wanted to I was so interested to help as many companies and learn about as many companies as I could I work with University libraries and sales teams and in Pharma where my background is education um but then I found the power of the niche so I've kind of niched into medical a little bit but I still have these other uh these other areas that I like to because in just on an aside as an entrepreneur and I'm not sure whether you found the same but like um I kind of thought the niche was oh well you're just simplifying yeah the niche is actually what I've learned is that um by me simplifying and what I do it helps the other people to understand so that's how the referrals can actually help better so if I say my name is Mike and I'm from Human scaffold and I want to help support Physicians and their teams to better support patients you're like hmm interesting hey oh tell me more about that rather than I just want to help everyone get along a hundred percent and it's so I don't know for you but for me when I I had those thoughts a lot when I was first starting Tiffin Tech as well like am I narrowing to am I getting too focused on a niche with tech like it's going to reach no one except a very specific group of people who are interested in Tech and then what I found and I you know especially over the years is by trying to reach everyone you're reaching no one you know it's yes it's like what's that saying where it's if you're pleasing everyone you're pleasing no one is that the same kind of thing and it's it's true it's I think it's a scary thing to do is to Niche down at first or nerve-wracking thing to do almost because you're like you know even for human scaffold medical what do you mean you what else are you missing out on yeah exactly you always say the grass is greener but in reality it's a really people you know when they're in the medical field and they're thinking of team building and they're thinking of you know bringing up everyone else they're going to think Mike yes yeah exactly I have specific questions for you that I'm going to reference because you know I usually try and keep these as organic as possible and whatnot but a lot of the questions I wanted to ask you today I want to make sure I I ask them specifically because they're questions that I get asked a lot around uh how to speak to your boss or how to speak to your other teammates or conflict so I don't want to miss one and then I'm like I get asked this all the time I should I missed this question so the first one I wanted to ask you is around what are some strategies that can help someone handle conflicts or disagreements with other colleagues okay so we're going to back up okay and maybe for the other questions this would be helpful as well right so um one thing I've learned is um you know here's the complicating Factor right um we all behave differently we're all unique in our own way right so how can you find a way to define that so that when you see a behavior in someone um you might be able to find a way forward to make it work so for instance um so I came up with this acronym and it's called The Seven Seas the Seven Seas yes but actually the letter c but it could also you know go the other way exactly we're sailing the Seven Seas of communication um so if we were to take four different pillars or areas so one is so imagine you have conflict with someone let's consider the seven C's right um so number one are they by Nature a confrontational person meaning that they have no problem speaking their mind and providing your opinions being maybe they're even a little competitive right or are they are they the opposite are they more cautious right wanna please everyone like you said before right like um so confrontational cautious okay one okay so in this case you know what we'll go back to the example after um I'll just get through the definitions the second one because there's four different ones uh the second one is I just have one C and that's communicative communicative communicative you have to do that yeah because it's a question mark right yeah quite communicative so either this is where we're getting into the extroversion introversion right are they more communicative person or are they someone that's a bit more introverted yeah so there's a question so you can start see where we're going now right so let's go to the next set of C's pair of C's um is the individual more calm as they approach things or do they like change and when you think about change then are they Dynamic are they multitaskers do they not let the grass grow beneath their feet or a bit more empathetic listener let's not be too you know not too hasty or things and then the last set of C's is are they more compliant rule follower detail-oriented even maybe a perfectionist or um creative creative from the standpoint of being willing to um work outside the box Wade through ambiguity yeah you know so um let's want to apply it to a uh a scenario yeah let's do it on the Fly okay um so imagine you have a boss that's pretty demanding okay um has no problem speaking your mind um and that always wants to push for Change and doesn't necessarily want to go the the way that things have been done okay let's think outside the box creative yes very good so I look to the production team that's okay okay we got an audience at least they're still with us um and what if you had the opposite so now you have uh someone that reports to that person who's more cautious a bit more introverted calm and follows the rules okay right so you have a conflict with your boss and we could do it one of two ways if the conflict is the boss is saying how come you know you know how come you're always just going so slow and you know you know you're not willing to think of new things and you don't like change and that type of thing or it could be the other way what if the the report is I'm afraid I don't want to upset them I don't want to say anything and um you know that's not the way things should be done I don't know what some other person the business unit director told me this and the manager told me this Calgon take me away you know so um so then what my advice would be to that person the report would be think about your manager and how they want to hear feedback direct yes I would think they would want to have it direct yes and they're not as introverted introverted people like to analyze things people that are more extroverted are less interested in analyzing yes on the whole right we're making huge sweeping generalizations here but the whole point of the Seven Seas is this is a way forward and then see how it goes yes it's kind of like a a road map almost would you say or yeah for sure yeah so it's a road map it sets the stage forward and so for instance the human scaffold I would have a video that would explain that and then in the workshop we would actually break it right down and meet with the manager whomever is running wants to have this Workshop tell me more about your work and your like what scenarios can we make that are relevant to you and then we put it to play and then we we have the scenario we break into group uh you know have breakouts and discuss it come up with tips we write them down I follow up with them about that and then we do like a reflection right yes so it's uh if if I I consciously set ahead at the beginning as like I'm not a PHD psychologist and I'm not going to pretend to be but um if you want someone to tell you what to do I'm not your guy but if you want to have someone help work through because I believe that everyone has the answers within the team or themselves then let's do that right I love that because then it's more of an improv ah which comes back to the drama the drama yes because it's that whole idea of the yes end of of improv and drama let's let's take the idea that you're presenting and then let's add to it to make it better and communicate back and forth because because I'm not a drama student so for the yes end it's how did that work in drama it was yeah so it's like uh based on improv so if someone's going to come up and say oh my goodness the sky looks green today yeah you wouldn't say no it doesn't yeah it's blue no you would say yeah it is blue it is green and you know what else I just saw an elephant fly by oh yeah yeah I did too yeah did you did they have feathers yes they did like you're you're you're you're promoting the idea and you know and building to it right so I can tell a quick story when I was a sales manager I used to apply this all the time and um um I you know for instance I fly into Montreal the rep would pick me up at the airport and they'd just like be bursting oh got this great idea and it's going to be this and uh you know and as they're telling me I'm like there's no way this is gonna work right for a number of reasons but I would say you know what I want to say no but I'm not going to yeah let's talk it out okay and I'm gonna pretend with you and we're just gonna go on this journey and down the road and let's see what that looks like and then they would say yeah no it's not going to work that's brilliant so you're almost leading them to because a lot of times people have these grandiose ideas or these great ideas that they're very excited about and rather than just shutting it down more so like yes and and then you start asking questions to make them almost uncover that oh wait maybe this isn't such a good idea after all yeah I think that's how people change yeah you know that's you have to go through and it's it's hard as a as a teacher or a manager or whatever to see someone be at a point where they're super excited about something but you think well well like you kind of need they need to live that yeah I don't want to take that away right so a good way to coach them through it so if you want to get the feedback or talk about feedback with someone along with the conflict do it through questions um why why tell someone what to do when you can try and guide them through it by asking questions and get them to that point right wow that's a great tip for someone like myself uh who who is more so introverted and I you know wants to to grow in leadership but doesn't like to necessarily just tell people what to do so more so like structuring it in a way where it's asking questions kind of makes it feel more collaborative you can use this at home Jeff yeah you can say to Paul just say you know how do you feel about having dust on the on the on the the shelving I like this yeah yeah I like this yeah you can really ask them how does it make you feel how do you think you'd like that oh yeah we got to get on this we got to figure something revolutionary yeah yeah literally wow yeah I bet for so much of the workshops that you that you coach people or or uh what word do you like to do you like the word that you coach people on or work with people on or what's the best way to kind of yeah you know what I don't really think about it some I have a couple clients like regular clients and they they call me their coach yes and it kind of makes you cringe a little bit because I kind of think of um like Mike Ditka football kind of Coach you know when I think of Coach no but I guess it's like that idea where you're like I've dedicated myself now to doing research and understanding all these different things so the the value that I'm bringing are sharing what I've learned and it's it's like anything like there's so few original things left to to um discover and yeah you know like so um so in that case it's almost like well here I have have you thought about this have you thought about that no I don't know anything about that you know it's I read this book called uh Thinking Fast and Slow have you heard of um the acronym um w s i a like I can't even spell it I'll just say it uh what you see is all there is what you is all there is yeah so you can help me so it's like it's almost like um you don't know what you don't know so if an in if if someone is is is explaining their understanding of something yes and then you know outside of that understanding then you can say well of course that's that's all you know so how do you introduce someone to a new idea and that's hard because that's change right and so that's scaffolding that's where you're going from that zone of proximal development introducing a new idea and helping them through it wow I love that um and I love too that you're very upfront with I just think it's really uh refreshing that you know there is not a lot of new ideas and it's more so it's rather than trying to recreate the wheel and you know be this Guru or whatever you want to call it it's more so becoming an expert through learnings and really soaking up all this knowledge and then being able to to communicate and convey that in different ways to different teams really yeah because it's it's almost I don't know Tiff on your end what what that the equivalent would be but imagine someone who's just immersing themselves and all they want to do is learn about communication then you go to that person and you ask them things and yeah like what would be the equivalent of that in your area of tech I mean I think it would be anyone who who focuses on specializing in a specific technology so becomes obsessed with whether it be a programming language or a tech is a specific Tech is a like AI or machine learning different things like that I'm definitely more of a generalist I like learning a little bit about a lot I think it's because it also too is how it's what's needed for Tiffin Tech but um yeah I would say that's probably but if there was one thing that you wanted to well and this is maybe why you're having this podcast you talk to people that have a specialization or an interest in that area and then um yeah I think I'm like you I'm a generalist in this area I like to learn so much about all these different things and um um yeah it's a lot of fun it is a lot of fun I I completely agree when uh one question I have for you is and maybe it relates back to the Seven Seas is a lot of times I get asked around I get questions around people who have difficult bosses or leadership and they don't know how to speak to them uh or you know let's give an ex let's give it a let's do a go through a specific example let's go through um you know the most awkward question of all time which is asking for a raise or a promotion for example so how would you apply the seven C's or maybe it's a different method that you'd apply to speaking to your boss that you maybe don't have the best rapport with and asking for a promotion like how would how what advice would you give to someone that position so we'll leave the Seven Seas just for a second because I think one area and I mentioned psychological safety before and I have to say a story that um when I was in drama and I was teaching drama I really realized the importance of having safety right for someone to get up and imagine you're in grade nine you don't know anyone you're gonna get up and you're going to deliver a monologue or you're going to do something even more embarrassing um you need everyone in the room to be on your side and not snickering or making fun of you or whatever right so when um what does it take to get there right someone's gonna say something or I hear something under their breath I can't let it go yeah I'll see in the hall have the conversation and say you can't do that and if you do then you can't come back yeah and so then you create that safety right because then that allows people to be vulnerable and when people can be vulnerable then that's when you start forming trust and then in order to have all those things together that's what allows open communication so bringing it back sorry the arms are starting to wave too I'm getting excited yes I like it it's starting dog mode open communication yeah um so then do you have that open communication with your boss yeah if you don't yeah then um see this is tough right because if you just come out and start randomly saying you know promotion I want a promotion I want this and you're like are they it hasn't been formed right and a lot of times if the boss is created or allowed an environment to to not flourish for open communication then what do you do right um so I'm going to take this in two ways one okay so how could they have fixed that okay from day one when you're hired um people talk about core values and the values of the company and I think a lot of people just want to throw in all the words that sound really good that make it sound like it's going to be amazing place like all this such integrity and everyone's honest and you know well yeah of course but what's it actually what does that mean in the behaviors of people right so that should all tie to the job description and it should be laid out right from the very beginning yes this is exactly what it's expected of you and here are the values that we embody in your job and so you can go back to the person at 2.99 months before you know you're about to make the commitment to the individual and say Here's all the things we've looked for for you and we've reviewed this with you and you've been accountable to it therefore we're going to keep moving forward with you and so if that manager would have done that with that individual that the person scared about asking for a raise then probably they haven't done a really good job of setting up that background of safety vulnerability trust and maybe they haven't really tied back the core values besides having them in the waiting room and never referring to them again right now let's look at it from the perspective of the um the person who's nervous right I'd go to the Seven Seas yeah then go to the 17th is this a person let's now let's make it hard right uh what if the boss is not a more competitive um direct communicator and they're more cautious and they're more introverted and they're a little bit more calm and are compliant ah so what do they want they want information right they're cautious in their decision making they want to hear more information they're analytical because they're introverts so they want to you want if you're going to provide them a rationale it better be well founded for it and then if they're compliant the type like that high C I see um then um you know it has to follow the rules right it has to be within the the you know the uh what do they call that band Pay Band I guess yeah the yeah bands yeah the bands like where you're at so if you're gonna ask for a huge raise that you know isn't going to be possible yeah for a person who's a rule follower and they want information it's going to be hard for to ask that person if it's the rule breaker who likes change yes they'd be like yeah I don't see why not right yeah that person's probably going to be an easy one to have this conversation with because they're direct and because they don't necessarily play by the traditional rules so they'd be willing to go to bat for you right especially if you've done what has been expected of you so for that person I would absolutely recommend being prepared yes having lots of rationale and giving that person who wants the information the information for them because they probably are a lot more reticent to do it themselves 100 it's so funny when you're that example made me think of my old my old boss and I worked at IBM and I was kind of pushing for that was he old yeah he your former boss former boss yeah old boss he was no I mean what is what is it I've been working here for 70 years yeah no but my former boss he uh was much he was he was exactly like oh this fly he was exactly he wants to be part of it he really does I know uh he was exactly what you just described very introverted very analytical uh and to the point where uh how did he say he was like he wanted me to lay everything out for him and document everything in a way that it would be presented to a jury yeah so literally like show my case basically and and absolutely document everything and and then I would say my current boss you know because I went from a large company to now a more startup is much more of the mindset of uh like go go go and actions speak louder than words almost if that makes sense so I would say it would be more so uh you don't need to write you know a 50 or have a 50 page PowerPoint but more so what have your action what have you actually done to you know in a sentence or two kind of thing imagine them reversed so imagine the the former boss who worked at a you worked at a huge corporation right coming into the more startup entrepreneurial environment yeah um it would be a huge adjustment for it right because um they want to play Within the Box in those rules and they did a good job by hiring that person in that place because that's what it was the right person for the right job right whereas that more entrepreneurial you know let's uh I'm comfortable with ambiguity and not really sure well of course because look at the point of you know you have to take chances in that situation or to grow the business right um so yeah so it's good on you also for being able to manage through both yeah yeah I mean some part points of the 50 page PowerPoint was maybe a little painful but you know we got there but again like that person probably doesn't feel comfortable Taking Chances right exactly risks so they want to have it all lined up so that they can say ah here you go it's all lined up yes they go to their boss and they they don't feel like they are um putting their ass on the line exactly that bad we're gonna get yeah that's okay we're good we're good but dude that is um that's exactly it it's and once I realized that and learned that to what exactly you said is they have a boss too or they have you know the board they have to report to as well for startup kind of thing and everyone has to report to someone and although it sometimes can be like oh why can't you just do this or why can't you just when you start thinking about their shoes and putting yourself in their position and what they have to report to it really makes you more empathetic and understanding as to what they're dealing with and and realize that a lot of times it's not about you meaning there's so much else going on too which makes it easier I find 100 and so in those that like that environment where you have to provide all this information up front like you're then modeling encouraging that behavior in your employees and that's why kind of things get slow and it's almost like quicksand yeah right yeah so when you finally do find someone who is more competitive and uh communicative yes yeah [Music] um more extroverted and likes change and wants to think outside the box it can work for sure yeah um but what is it going to be like for that manager managing this this person if you're more traditional conservative and then you have someone who's going to push push push you have to have someone like that in your team yeah but a lot of times people don't yeah and so this is where we then build in like again we can this is another whole podcast about creating a team building a team right all the different pieces of it and having a manager who's able and willing to hear from everyone and create the safety and create the trust and have the open communication right so yeah Shangri-La yeah yeah we what does that mean oh just like living the dream oh I haven't heard that one you've heard that no oh okay it makes me think of a Shangri-La Hotel which is living the dream if you stay there so yeah and I think that's right it's come from one of the other yeah I like that Shangri-La yeah that's perfect um I wasn't going to ask you on that note oh I was gonna ask you okay so I didn't have the am I I'm kind of going sideways here sure but throughout working with many different teams both small large uh is there a common question or common challenge that teams face regardless of size or where they're at or something that you seem to be pretty see that's pretty common it really is you know I hate to be a cop out on the answer but it really just depends on the demand of the business right um you know if it's more sales fast-paced then you're gonna get more of the competitive extrovert change creative type of people right and in sales like I've seen these models where um have you ever had this where um um like these um can I I'm I'm so I don't know a lot about this stuff but like a canva or a calendly or those kind of upstart yes um companies that are really doing cool stuff when they go and they introduce someone will come to you and they'll they'll reach out to you by email you respond you call them and then they say perfect we're going to book an appointment okay awesome can't wait to meet you and then someone else is there you're like oh okay and then they kind of walk you through the whole plan and everything okay I think I'm gonna sign up awesome if you have any problems let us know yeah you have a problem you let them know it's not them it's someone else right so who's the person that came to you right off the bat that's the hunter that's the high that that uh more competitive extrovert who's coming in bringing in the business and then they hand it off to the next person who's more of an extrovert but ah is also really good with the compliance right and following the rules knowing what needs to be happening and then the next person is more of um I think they call it the farmer or something like that like that is going to be managing the relationship right so they've really nailed it when those things happen and when I've been through it I even comment to them I'm like this is awesome yeah the company congratulate your manager you've really nailed it because you have all the right people in the right position and this is why the team is working out so well the different personalities that are needed for each role yes yeah so anyway going back to your question um it really depends on the needs I think so if you have those right people in the right spots then the problems are going to be different if you have a whole bunch of high pressure sales people that are Hunters all together in a room they're all going to be really focused on sharing their opinion with each other and being very um not competitive but you know very confrontational with one another yeah if this scenario is right and the core values are set and everyone knows the role and everyone sets the expectations of respectful Candor at the front no problem it's gonna work when those things are eroded or aren't happening at the beginning then this is when the problem starts expectations has so much to do with it if you get a bunch of people that are um Tech type people that just kind of work at their station and don't really interact with other people then they're probably more cautious and probably more introverted and calm and like to follow the rules so there's probably going to be maybe some more passive aggressive behaviors if they have a problem with someone else they'll probably tell everyone else except for that person like that kind of thing yes that makes sense so there are problems but they're different different problems for different kind of yeah because it goes back to Seven Seas really the seven C's yeah yeah you you float in the Seven Seas yeah and when the waters are calm there's no problem I know yeah exactly when it gets choppy you got a bit of an issue you got a bit of an issue I love that I'm always gonna remember the Seven Seas now because it's so good yeah it's so memorable and you can visualize like I'm visualizing a lot of water and the whole thing so it's just repetition right yeah um and let me say one thing importantly with behavior that's one slice of the puzzle that's also an individual's genetic makeup and uh their maturity and you know what their family life what where they were born in the flow of different if you're the youngest of eight brothers and sisters that has an effect on how like there's so many other parts so we're just talking pure behaviors but it's a start and it's a it's a concept that you can use and build off of 100 and at the very least like you're at the very minimum uh it's a good way to to boost your confidence in understanding that okay I know based on going through this checklist I know to some degree how my boss likes to communicate or how I can you know really convey what I'm trying to get across which even just going through that sometimes what you need is the confidence to to start communicating more and and that helps with that too for sure quick story was that Tim Hortons yesterday um I walked right in I guess my neighborhood Tim Hortons I walked in got my coffee boom I was out in two seconds and as I was waiting well 1.5 seconds before I got my coffee um I saw someone who's waiting in the pickup line okay and they were looking around and like oh okay and then they went back and they went all the way to the back of the line so they had a big thing they had a big long wait ahead of them right because they didn't know the framework yes of how it works in the Tim Hortons now they know right so now and it's going to be that much more efficient and then they just go through it unconsciously the next time they'll always now they'll always know but it sometimes takes a little bit of uh Growing Pains to get there yeah so why not do that with communication it's so true yeah Mike I always end these conversations with the same question which is what is some advice you would give to your younger self oh boy how young how young do we want to go back baby whisper in the crib do you know is there someone younger younger meeting maybe in in high school or starting their career and you know what's some advice I that you wish someone would have told you or you learned too late not too late but you wish you would have learned earlier it's a hard question you know so when I was young maybe before 10 before the age of 10 I was really really shy yeah and I didn't like people I didn't like people coming over I didn't want to talk to other people outside my family I was very very introverted right so I think I would probably tell me at that age just keep doing what you're doing because I love that you could very easily go and say well you shouldn't do that be more extroverted or whatever but um you know I think it's it's like I have no regrets in the path that I've taken so I wouldn't want to un experience something by giving myself that um that um advice I think that was a really crappy answer no I think it's I think you were looking for something really profound no I think that is really profound actually because it's one it goes back to everything because there's you know through life you go through so many ups and downs and you feel like oh I should have done this or why didn't I do that if I would have known but at the end of the day it makes you who you are which and I think it's going to go full circle I was talking to my mom the other day and she said like oh if I I don't ever want to go to a long-term home I you know I said I totally wouldn't I'm gonna hate people I'm going full circle man yeah that's why I'm getting all this communication stuff out of the way now get out of the way now I'm done with yeah I'm kidding but yeah no that's kind of not yeah yeah well on that note I mean it's a great way to to end the podcast on on Long-Term Care Homes yes exactly where we're going uh no Mike it was great to
