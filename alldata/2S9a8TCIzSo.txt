hey everyone welcome back to talk tech with 
tiff today i sat down with melissa who is the   co-founder of the app pockpock we got into what it

really entails to find users and how to go about   that some of the challenges it brings and so much 
more this was a very valuable conversation and i   hope you enjoyed it as much as i do also i have 
linked down below my newsletter which contains   unique discount codes career tips coding tips and 
so much more so make sure to go sign up for it   okay let's get started welcome to my new series 
called talk tech with tiff where i am sitting down   with industry professionals to hear about their 
career journeys and current roles i created this   series to hear from people who are established 
in the tech industry so that we can all learn   what these individuals do in their day-to-day jobs 
and the type of opportunities that are out there   okay let's get started hi melissa how are you 
i'm good how are you i'm doing good i can't   complain it's a gorgeous saturday so it's always 
nice it is it's beautiful day well i was really   excited to sit down and speak with you especially 
about your company poc poc but before we get into   it tell me a little bit about yourself and your 
background sure yeah thank you for having me again   so my background's kind of crazy i love that i 
i fell into tech in in a very serendipitous way   and my career started in germany actually where i 
used to live and i was working at a small fashion   startup there when i met a woman at a bus stop and 
then ended up working at the walt disney company   so yeah i spent a good chunk of my career 
at disney as a product designer for baby and   toddler products um not in the tech space but in 
the physical product space and then i moved back   to toronto and got into tech i started working at 
a startup here in marketing and then ended up um   starting pockpock after that so it's been kind of 
a whirlwind i've had many different types of jobs   i think that's always the best though because 
through each one you gain so much experience   absolutely going back to i love how you two just 
like it was so casual like and then i just started   a company and you know pogba and it's doing 
great and but what was it kind of taking a step   well actually before i ask you that let's talk 
a little bit about for those who aren't familiar   with pockpock what it is sure yes that's probably 
pretty important so um is an edtech startup based   here in toronto and we're really on a mission 
to help raise the next generation of kids to be   creative out of the box thinkers through 
digital play so our first product is called   pockpock playroom it's a preschool app for kids 
two to six years old and it's essentially just   a digital playroom filled with open-ended toys 
that spark imagination and creativity and learning   through open-ended play wow that's amazing how 
did how did this i mean how did this concept   uh or idea initially come to you so i i can't take 
full credit to be honest so my co-founder esther   and her husband matthias they had just given birth 
to their second son and already had a two-year-old   at home and they were starting to look around for 
technological options for their two-year-old to   play with that would be not only entertaining 
and stimulating but also really educational and   self-guided because they they thought you know if 
we're going to give our child screen time we want   it to be a moment that we can take for ourselves 
as parents and not have to sit there and be part   of it and when they started looking around the app 
store they found nothing other than very highly   overstimulating and addictive video games that 
weren't really designed properly for young kids or   more pedagogical style apps that are really 
focused on having kids memorize and regurgitate   information like the abcs the 123s and all 
those things that are very valuable but   there was this huge missing piece in the middle 
which is what about creative learning what about   imagination and empowering kids to think 
outside of the box and problem solve and   develop social emotional skills and kind of 
all that awesome stuff that happens like on the   floor of a messy playroom in your house why didn't 
that exist in a digital space and so they started   creating something on their own on the weekends 
which was going to be a digital storybook with   no language so um just like some images that you 
could tap and they would animate and make a sound   and that's when i had the pleasure of meeting 
them and we started talking a lot more about this   sort of big problem that they had in their own 
household and putting that into a bigger context   of how you know our kids are going to grow up to 
have jobs that haven't even been invented yet and   so many of the jobs that say you and i have today 
could be taken over by ai or other types of tech   so we were like how do we equip our kids for the 
future and there are so many important skills that   kids will learn in the classroom but we really 
wanted to focus on those life skills because   technology right now can't think creatively 
so that's something that's innately human we   want to really focus on fostering so we 
decided to start the company to really   try to do that so bring technology into children's 
lives in a really mindful and healthy way   but with the intention of really sparking their 
creative thinking i love that and and like you   said it was such a gap in the market prior to 
pockpot coming around that uh it's amazing to   see how how quickly it's just taken on like 
you know i know congratulations by the way   i know you just raised three million dollars to 
continue to expand so that's thank you huge going   back to your early days uh you mentioned prior 
to pogba you were working for a company here   what was it like it's scary leaving you know 
that comfort and having that job what was it like   that transition for you it's a good question 
i think i grew up in a very entrepreneurial   household and my brother is the co-founder 
of snowman which is another toronto-based   creative studio so the apple doesn't fall far but 
um so i i definitely was afraid but i knew that   you know at first i saw my brother could do it i 
was like if he could do it i could do it yeah yeah   we're very competitive um no but more seriously 
i think you know it's it's terrifying because   not only do you lose the comfort of of a of a 
stable job but you also take on the weight of of   a company and i think that's something that you 
know you you can't just get away from so i knew   that it was going to be not only transitioning my 
entire day-to-day in terms of what i was doing for   my job but also my life so just thinking about a 
nine-to-five job like that doesn't exist for me   anymore and i do i i don't stop thinking about 
pock pockets yeah for better or for worse yeah   i think that was a big scary thing was to really 
accept like okay this is now my job is going to   become my life whereas before my job was just 
part of my life and um there's no company i'd   rather do that with in pockpock because it's 
something i'm really passionate about but   i think starting your own company um it's no 
joke in the sense that like it's gonna take over   your life probably in many ways at least at 
the beginning and while work-life balance is   super important to me and i try my best 
to to to stay healthy in that sense um   yeah it's hard to get away from so it was it 
was scary but yeah yeah so far so good exactly   and it's one of those things that you have to 
if you're making that leap you really have to   believe in and be passionate about what 
you're doing because like you said it's   your whole life especially at the beginning it 
is absolutely and there's also the learning curve   of going from doing one job in a company and 
being part of a bigger organization and being   somewhat of a cog in a machine to building that 
machine yeah so it's a very different skill set   and just takes a lot of a lot of um resilience i 
think because you fail so much so it's a lot of um   you know support is really important kind of 
speaking about that with failure and finding   support did you have moments especially when you 
were starting out but when you're like i'm not   able to do this i'm not equipped to do this like 
kind of almost imposter syndrome and how did you   navigate that oh of course i think people who who 
say that they don't have that are lying i don't   agree i agree um yeah absolutely there's so many 
things that i've done for the very first time with   pockpock so i had a lot of moments where i was 
wavering and wondering like can i really do this   and what if i screw up or it's not just me i have 
a whole team of people and we aster and i and like   all of our co-founders we really care a lot about 
them so it's a lot of responsibility to make sure   that they're all so happy and i think that that's 
um that's just a big deal and how do i overcome it   resilience like my i learned many years ago that 
nobody really knows what they're doing in life   and everyone's kind of faking it until they make 
it so i just looked around and was like okay if   that person can do it i can do it why why not 
what's the difference like there literally is   no difference i'm the only one getting in my way 
because if a friend came to me or my brother came   and said hey like i'm not sure i can do this 
or we're having challenges with the business   um it would be a no-brainer for me to be like of 
course you can do this like why can't you you're   the perfect person to do it so i really just 
started to look in the mirror and realize like   give like take your own advice melissa and some 
days it's easier to do that than others but having   a good support system is really crucial and i'm 
very lucky to have amazing co-founders who um you   know we were there for each other we we try not 
to you know have our meltdowns at the same time   no i'm just joking but scheduled in like my mouth 
runs on monday yours can be on tuesday yes no just   trying to be there for each other and and frankly 
we haven't had a lot of crises we're very lucky   to um you know be heading on the right path so 
that's great i i completely resonate when you said   if they can do this why can't i because that's 
been my my motto in my my head throughout all   my journey as well and it's so true i always just 
think well why can't i do it then you know and it   really helps break it down in a less intimidating 
way absolutely i totally agree with you   i think we have a tendency as humans to assume 
that everybody else in the room is really   confident and knows knows what they're doing and 
feels good in their own skin and is really well   equipped for whatever task is at hand but i think 
you'll find that that's not generally the case in   in every situation and so um yeah it's reassuring 
to know that other people have doubts and concerns   and feelings like that and just remembering you 
know you're not in it alone like let's just try   to help each other out figure it out together yeah 
exactly going back to the early days of pockpock   what was some of the biggest challenges for me and 
maybe this isn't one but for me when i think of uh   apps i think finding users would be a very big 
challenge was that one of them or what were   some of the biggest ones yeah finding users is 
definitely not easy especially for us because our   user is not our customer so our users are two 
to six year old so we don't advertise to them   and frankly we can't really speak to them directly 
in most situations so we're talking to the parents   yeah our customers and that has been a really cool 
and interesting challenge for us when we launched   we didn't do any marketing we just did pr which i 
just did on my own and we were only now starting   to invest in marketing a year after launch 
and so visibility on the app store is a huge   factor in the success of an app and so 
we're very lucky that apple likes pockpock   and we won an apple design award last june which 
um thank you which was incredible and insane and   that really helped boost our visibility 
on the app store because once you're an   apple design award winner you're bundled into 
a lot of features and and different like lists   and groups and you get a lot of press and all of 
that really helped kind of push us forward because   it was just two weeks after we'd launched 
wow so that was a huge help for us and then   i would say also just balancing out the needs of 
the kids with the needs of the business so for us   like our number one priority is how do we serve 
kids best yes if that means our company's gonna   go under then it's gonna go under because like we 
we care so much about the kids and we want to make   sure we're not cutting corners and we're building 
the business for them but we also have a team   that we have to pay we have an office we have to 
pay rent for and and frankly we're we're here to   make money as well so i think just always keeping 
that in track and making sure that our creative   decisions come first but that the business follows 
very close behind and that we're doing things   that are going to set us up for success in the 
future because ultimately we want to stick around   for a long time and our whole mission is to become 
like the pixar of play and to do that we need time   so to to get time we need money to get money we 
need users so it's a very um cyclical process and   so that's always been a little bit of a challenge 
is balancing those two things but um i think so   far we've been doing a really good job and we've 
been super fortunate that families love potpock so   much because screen time as you know is a tricky 
subject in many households totally understandably   and as a parent myself like i completely 
understand why and but you know for us seeing that   parents don't feel guilty about screen time and 
are actually evangelizing pogba for us among their   friends and other parent communities that's huge 
and so that's been a really big help for us in   terms of growing that is and to really have this 
past year not done to just do more of the pr site   but not even done the official marketing side as 
you said like i can't even imagine what the next   six months next year is going to look for pockpock 
thank you i hope so we have some amazing new folks   on the team who are very busy um trying to to 
help really focus on these areas now which were   super excited for because the more people we 
have playing pogba the more feedback we get   and the better the product gets so that that's a 
really important detail as well it is and it's an   interesting challenge uh or interesting thing 
you mentioned about you're not marketing of   course to your end user i never thought of that 
before but that's such an interesting thing to   navigate really it is it's very it's very fun and 
very unique for sure and it gives us a lot of cool   opportunities because on the one hand like we 
we want to talk to the kids as much as we can   because toddlers don't lie like if you see if you 
hand them a toy to test and they don't like it   they're just gonna hand the ipad back to me like 
i hate this yeah it's true or they might even say   anything they'll just walk away and go place with 
some lego um and so that tells us so so much so we   want to always try to get through the path to them 
and we have to go through their parents of course   and they're the one paying for pogba so we need 
to make sure that they're feeling comfortable   with it and they feel that there's value in 
there for their child so it's really fun we   get to talk to a lot of awesome families that's 
amazing and like you said it's it you talk to one   family and they they start using it they love it 
then it's word of mouth it just trickles really   it's trickling yes very quickly i'm sure there 
is so much uh ahead i know there's so much ahead   for pogba but is there uh things that are ahead 
that you can share with us today yeah so we're   going to be continuing to update the playroom very 
regularly which we already do about every four to   six weeks um playroom is a subscription so we want 
to make sure that there's a ton of value there   and also for kids you know they're never they 
never stop being curious so we want to make sure   that there's always something new to discover so 
that's a really um exciting part of what's to come   we have a lot of new updates coming i can share 
that we have we'll actually won next week which   is a marble run which i think is a really awesome 
sort of stem focused toy we spent a lot of time   actually here at the ontario science center doing 
research because there's a life life-size massive   marble machine i don't know if you've ever been 
there no i haven't seen that you definitely have   to go it's amazing um and then we're doing a big 
space update later this year and we have a lot of   what we're creating comes from the user so they'll 
ask for something and then we try to think about   how we can bring that into the playroom and then 
play room aside you know we're really starting to   think about how we continue to develop innovative 
digital toys for older kids as well because when   the kids turn six or seven and they start to 
age out of playroom we want to be there to   bring them an experience that's just as open-ended 
and creative and empowering as the playroom but   with a little bit more depth and challenge 
because they'll be a little bit older so   we're starting to think about those next products 
as well which will also all be app based so it's   a little kind of sneak peek as to what might 
be to come and yeah just trying to get pock   pock in the hands of more families i think is a 
really big focus for us because we haven't really   spent a lot of time doing that we've really been 
product obsessed for the last couple of years and   spent the first year post launch really focusing 
on that so lots to come for lots to come it's   very exciting things i i could i feel like i could 
sit with you for a long time continuing to ask you   questions around pogba and your journey because 
it's just so inspiring but to to really end the   conversation i asked this to everyone which is 
what advice would you give to your younger self   it's a really good question i asked this to 
my husband this morning actually and he had a   good answer too but i would say that i would tell 
myself to stop worrying and really just let what   everybody else thinks go and just follow your gut 
because there's been so many times in my career   and in my life where i've been too concerned 
with how i'm perceived or too concerned with   um if what i'm doing feels right and if i 
should trust my instincts but i've learned   like just screw it just do whatever you want life 
is short and you have to trust yourself because   you're the only one who knows you the best so i 
think that's a huge thing and then also just to   remember that um you know like like we 
were talking about before that everybody   is going through something and everybody's trying 
their best and if you feel like [ __ ] one day i   don't know if i can say that you might have to 
bleep me out no um but if you feel like crap   one day you can remember like everybody has bad 
days and don't let that get you down and just   follow your heart because we spend most of our 
lives working so you have to love what you do i   totally agree i feel like i really needed all 
that advice personally right now so thank you   melissa it was so great sitting down today to 
chat with you about pockpock and your journey   thank you for being here thank you for having 
me it was such a pleasure thank you amazing cool
