and the reason why I care so much about this is that if we talk about the notion that there are principalities or they're they're like there are agencies which are above the human consciousness or that gather human consciousnesses together and gather phenomena together let's say then the idea that it's only either from heaven or hell that it's only good or bad is not the one we experience we experience Agency on us that doesn't necessarily have those two polarities and so the problem is if we experience that then how do we account for it in in in our own symbolic structure how can we talk about it this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] [Applause] so hello everybody this is the return of Richard Roland we haven't done this in a while uh Universal History Richard has been super busy right you've been you've been traveling a lot I've been busy too we've all been pretty busy and so but it's all for exciting things and uh and we're gonna see some uh we were just talking about the golden key which is a book that Richard has been bringing up once in a while that he's working on now I wrote a piece for and we're going to move on move forward with bringing that out you know Richard is right now publishing all his fantasy stuff he he started he started posting that and so we'll put a link to that in the description there's just so many amazing things going on so uh so Richard thanks for thanks for despite everything coming along well I'm very glad to be here and the extra like uh the back story that people out there don't know is this is like the third time that we've actually tried to get together and record this episode and one time we just ended up needing to work on some other stuff and another time I scheduled it on American Thanksgiving not realizing that it was American Thanksgiving and so uh I was at church and you messaged me and you're like hey are we talking today wait it's Thanksgiving you're probably I was realizing it in in like real time yeah sitting there in the zoom yeah but we're here now and I'm very excited because I get to talk about uh stuff that I actually know things about um which is always fun uh so we're going to talk about the Anglo-Saxons today um and as many people know I'm a dramatic philologist that's really you could say that's what like my door into medieval studies uh you know I've always been interested in the Middle Middle Ages but even as a kid but um my real door into medieval studies as a as a scholar was through Germanic philology and specifically Anglo-Saxon and Old Norse literature and languages and um so we're going to start by talking about um it'd probably be the first of a couple of conversations about the old north um and Universal history and the way that the the way that the Christians of the late Germanic Iron Age uh which is this the Germanic Iron Age is a period some people well there are different dates assigned to it but I think most people have it from about 500 BC maybe a little bit later uh up to 800 A.D so the late Germanic Iron Age this is the period in which the um uh this and Beyond is the period in which the various uh Northern Germanic peoples begin to convert to Christianity um and um it's the basically it's the period immediately before the Viking age so we will get into some Viking age stuff as well so probably not today but in the future um so what I wanted to talk about was um actually let's just pick up again with the uh the the uh Chronicle uh or The Apocalypse of pseudo Methodius it seems like this is a text that we just come back to constantly over and over again and it really is a central text to the way that these cultures understood Universal history and one of the important things to note about this text and something we've brought up a couple of times before is that in the Apocalypse of pseudomothodius we find a witness of this tradition that there was a fourth son of Noah now I think that in The Apocalypse of pseudo Methodius he's named something like uh uh yonatus or uh I think that's right and he would be born After the flood is that the idea or yoniton or yonotus oh okay so that's I mean that's the question that's actually the big spicy question about him and this goes back to The Apocalypse of pseudom Methodius is relying for this on a much earlier Syriac work called the cave of treasures in case anybody's wondering and there's a pretty good I think Sebastian Brock did a pretty good translation of that so you can go read that it's got just like a bunch of the early Syrian uh Slash you know the early Christian slash late Jewish Traditions that were preserved in Syria and um concerning like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and all this stuff and if you wanted to if you wanted to get like a better um a framework for reading data from the Syria and that's a pretty good it's a pretty good place to start but um yeah so this is the question where when was he born where was he born um some uh ancient authors and medieval authors have him being born on the ark others have him being born after the art because uh the Genesis text is actually fairly explicit about who exited the ark right and so it's this so then it's like well but you know maybe he's a little baby so uh just just in case people don't know there is a strong tradition that um uh in in a lot of ancient texts especially in Syrian uh that when so Noah has these three sons and then when God tells him that he's going to destroy the Earth with a flood Noah lives uh as celibate until the flood oh really interesting yeah this is this is pretty well attested tradition okay so so the idea is that he lives a celibate until the flood and then on the ark with his wife he conceives this fourth son and he's either born of the ark or he's born after they disembark um kind of depending I mean the sort of like the the math if he's born if he's conceived on the ark the math doesn't really work for him to have been born on there necessarily but you know these are this is long ago and far off time so you know uh mathematical considerations not the most important thing and also people lived 900 years so yeah yeah who knows how long it took for a child right exactly yeah yeah so um so yeah and and you could think about the symbolism of that in itself the idea that Noah lived as celibate when he was building the ark yeah but then he conceives uh a son while he's on the ark and while the flood waters are covering the Earth yeah and also it I mean especially if you understand the ark as the seed for the new world then it all kind of makes sense and if you understand the ark as an image almost like of a of the a holy place you know in chaos you know there's all these there's different types the ark has all kinds of associations but that those associations are definitely there you see some medieval representations of the Ark as a seed if you've ever seen it looks like uh it's like kind of like not a sort of almond shaped like an almond shaped yeah so yeah so I mean and I mean there's some weird stuff too uh about this trying to decide how weird we want to go for for our return to Universal history so I mean world is competing with you for weirdness right now there's you know what it's a very you're right that's a very good point so there's this very ancient association between flooding and menstruation yeah um which you know if you've met red Matthew's book uh is very it's very easy to understand it makes sense but they're also like certain taboos about reproduction uh during during menstruation like that the point of all of this is the fact that this fourth son uh may have been conceived on the ark yeah but it's important to understand like I know this is we're getting into really weird territory here but it's okay but we also let's say New Beginnings are born out of exceptional things and yeah that's that's what I'm trying to get to and you can even like see this in the way like they're sending the Raven out sending the dove out the sea the branch all that stuff right it's new life being born out of this like really exceptional kind of a space and and so this fourth son of Noah who in uh Greek and Syrian text is usually like yonton or yoniton or uh yonitos in I think in Latin although I think there's also a Georgian version that's like bony tour or something like that but anyway this character character this figure of the fourth son the point is that he's born out of this kind of weird liminal marginal space right you know and he he functions in that way in more than one way for instance uh first of all he you know isn't actually in the canonical text of scripture right this is uh I wouldn't say it's a minority tradition it's an obscure tradition today but everyone in the Middle Ages knew about this but um but it's definitely it's definitely an apocryphal tradition right uh in the sense of you know apocryphal being something that's hidden right and and uh if people don't remember in The Apocalypse of pseudo Methodius the role that he has is that he goes off far to the east which seems like the wrong direction for the stuff we're going to be talking about today but he goes off forward to these to the land to the Land of the Rising Sun uh is actually what it says and there he is taught sort of esoteric wisdom from God and uh eventually like Nimrod goes off and travels and uh he's uh he's the one that Nimrod learns like divination and astronomy and things like this from Nimrod learns this from yongtong yeah in the in the in the like the Cave of Wonders like in the Syrian text yeah and um and of course this is problematic because Nimrod also introduces the the worship of fire um right he finds this fire ascending from the earth like so the light coming from below is opposed to the light coming from above and he goes down to where the light is coming from and he uh a voice speaks to him out of the fire and he worships it and this is like a sort of like a Syrian you know there's a bit of like a polemic against their Persian neighbors here right uh the Zoroastrianism of the worship of fire but anyway So eventually yonton tells him you know don't come back you know teaches them some some stuff but then he kind of sees the direction Nimrod is heading and he tells him don't come back so anyway he's this interesting figure and he's really Associated you know back when we were talking about India in the Far East he's Associated ultimately with the idea of like the Easter of Eastern wisdom the Eastern philosopher the gymnosophist all that stuff goes back to goes back to this this fourth set of Noah so the weird thing is that there is actually there are a large number of connections which we are really just coming to understand when I say we I mean like the the scholarly community at large people who study uh Old English culture uh uh Germanic studies Etc there are a large number of connections between what you could call the Old Testament pseudo epigrapha like the legit Apocrypha when I say Apocrypha I don't mean like Tobit or Maccabees or Judith or something like that that's just the director's cut of the Bible um but when I so when I say Apocrypha I mean like really apocryphal stuff like uh um you know the Book of Enoch The Book of Enoch is a good example yeah or the life unless you're Ethiopian obviously but um uh The Book of Enoch the life of Adam and Eve stuff like that so there is a huge connection between this apocryphal literature uh the Syrian tradition uh which was probably the the means of conveyance for a lot of these things and Anglo-Saxon Christianity which is again a very surprising kind of a thing and I think that's part of why it's taken us so long to notice um because in the past traditionally uh Academia has been very siled so if you are somebody studying Syriac or Ethiopian you were probably not all somebody who was also studying you know Beowulf yeah yeah but the nestorians appear in the Middle Ages in the kind of weird tales as these yeah as these kind of mystical yeah so similar to the way the gymnosophists appeared yeah yeah but this is even before that this connection comes back even before that and um in this case we actually have a a name a face a date that we can probably Peg the connection to um so it comes through a couple of of routes one is that there was a huge treasury of these pseudopigraphal texts usually translated first into Latin and then into Old Irish that were kept in these Irish monasteries and so people who know the story of the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons it really happened from two directions there was a a Roman uh push for conversion kind of from the south and then at the same time there was a an Irish push for conversion from the north and eventually the two sort of met in the middle and they had some synods and you know it's a whole it's a whole thing but these Irish monasteries uh unfortunately most of the manuscripts they had were destroyed by Vikings during the Viking age but these Irish monasteries had um extensive collections of these pseudo epigraphal texts for instance there is a an old Irish um it's called the Saltair narain probably said that wrong uh because it's old Irish but um and and and uh my my brain does not do Gaelic languages so anyway all the all the all the Gaelic like the old the old Irish speakers out there you have to just forgive me it's your Anglo-Saxon you know yeah man you can't do it can't do it yeah but the Saltair no rain uh or which literally just means like the psalter of the quatraines um is a collection of about a hundred I think it's exactly no it's 150 because it's a Salter so it's got 150 poems in it um it's a collection of of uh 150 Psalms or you know quatrains you know these poems that that have like these the basic stings that is four lines right and basically it's the entire old Irish Universal history of the world starting with Adam and Eve and the creation of the world and going forward through time and if you go read the Sultana rain what they basically do is they take all of this all of the pseudopigraphal stuff and they take the early chapters of Genesis and they take you know the rest of the historical books of the scriptures and the gospels and all these things and they just weave it together into a cohesive account and I just want to emphasize this was a book that was made for Lay people it's not written in Latin It Was Written in Old Irish because the point of it was uh that it would be easy way to sort of teach people the I don't want to say teach people their Bible but teach people the tradition like teach people like pass on pass on what do we as Christians believe about um where we came from the origins of humanity where did demons and angels and fairies and all the stuff and so you can go look at this and I don't think the whole thing has been translated into English but good bits of it have there might be there might be a a a a whole translation in English that's like really archaic I think maybe back in the 1800s but um they do give the origin of fairies in there I mean yes I mean where where fairies are uh you're gonna get me off on a on a thing here um sorry yeah no it's okay I mean it's just so interesting yeah um well actually I was at uh I was at doxicon in October November and uh there was some symbolic World folks there which is great we got a picture together and uh it's great to see you all but adoxicon somebody gave this beautiful uh talk and it was just on you know 19th century first-hand accounts of people who met fairies and the fairies were asking will can we be saved right that was the question and uh the the the general consensus in all of these stories seems to sort of be that's a question that cannot be known until the day of judgment but anyway yeah like you start getting to the fairy thing it's really interesting but basically in the Middle Ages there are two or three main theories of where what fairies are and where they come from and the you know the first one of those and this is also found in rabbinic literature is that they are the unwashed children of Eve you you know this idea that God or the Archangel Michael depending on the story comes to bless Eve and her children as after the fall and um Eve uh puts her uh uh but but it's like it's like washing day and not all the kids are clean right and so she puts the dirty ones behind her back and they don't get the blessing um and so the ones that are blessed are the ones from which humanity is ascended and the ones that didn't get the blessing they're the ones that fairies are descended from so they're sort of like kind of like well fairies and gin and like you know all the all the you know these different yeah these intermediary ambiguous kind of spirits so that's one Theory another theory and I think this is the one that you find in the Saltair in the rain is that fairies are the descendants of angels who took a neutral stance during the war in heaven so during the work oh really oh you didn't know this so this is what I've been wondering about if that exists if there was again okay a gin tradition in Christianity neutral space or ambiguous space yeah so so this is is probably in the Middle Ages it's probably the most common theory for where fairies come from so the basic idea is that they were Angels who took took a neutral position in the war in heaven and they didn't fight against uh Lucifer but they also didn't fight on the side of God so they're they're cast out but they're not cast all the way down so whereas Lucifer the devil and his angels they're cast down to Hell these guys are cast sort of halfway down to earth and they become these sort of like very earthy spirits and and this is like this these spirits of their these in between spirits of the air like they're right there are these in between spirits of the air and so then this is why there's this big question in like sort of Irish folklore of can they be saved because they weren't like totally damned right so then now this is almost very similar to The Gin it's more or less exactly the same and I think that I think that that ties back to a much older uh kind of organizational source for both of those Traditions yeah um and by the way I'll just put a like a little plug uh you won't actually get it in this book but you'll find it in the next one that's going to come out this next year um in my own sort of fantasy legendarium this is the origin that I use for they're not called fairies in the story but the essentially the fairies that the main culture the embodian culture in my fantasy story they're descended from but one of the things that I try to sort of suss out in my own reworking of that myth is well why did they take this neutral position and try to answer that question so if you want my personal take on that you can read sometime next year and then it comes out yeah that book will come out but anyway so then the third the third theory of kind of where fairies come from is essentially that they're the Nephilim oh directly now yeah and and so with the Nephilim understood as as either the descendants of Cain or the descendants of the sons of God Daughters of men it just depends on like how do you read that sons of God Daughters of anything even in the Syriac sources like for instance saying Ephraim uh is a very early witness to like that sort of cephite hypothesis um and whereas there are other other you know or very early texts such as the Book of Enoch which have it which have it as you know this coupling of angels and humans and we've talked before about why these are not really uh and in the Middle Ages especially by the authors of things like the Beowulf poem these are not necessarily viewed as mutually exclusive positions because well for one thing either way either way that you read it there's a there's this Unholy pairing at these you know uh movement down the mountain at these levels of the ontological hierarchy and the line of Cain is always involved somehow either the light and with Father Stephen deyoung's uh kind of exposition ritual aspect of it then those two actually can completely coexist and there's no issue at all right so for me it's not people are like oh but doesn't this person say this and doesn't this person say this and um you know it's since we're just doing tangents today so there's a little bit uh for for for some other studies that I've been doing I've been reading a lot of Saint Cyril of Alexandria lately and um he has a um he has this wonderful wonderful sort of polemic piece called uh against Julian right so this is a piece that he writes against Julie in the apostate and one of the things that he does is he excerpts uh significant portions of Julian the apostates against the galileans which is his his sort of tirade against Christianity and um and it's really the I think it's the only extant place that we actually have that now is excerpted within Saint Cyril but in uh in Julian's writings he he's giving all of these arguments against the Virgin birth which he finds I mean Julian is I don't I don't know how to say this nicely um you don't have to say anything nice about Julian the apostate well no that's not here here's the thing Julian has like a bunch of very Protestant objections to Christianity like and again I'm not trying to like at my Protestant friends or family or whatever but like gilding the apostate if you if you read his actual complaints like Chris against Christianity he can't stand the fact that we're kissing relics he can't stand the fact that we think the Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ he can't stand the fact that we call Mary the theotokos this is literally this is one of his main arguments against Christianity is he says it's insane to call a human woman the mother of God you can't do that right so he's actually like a an early witness to a couple of things one is that at this very early stage theotokos was a title everybody had already been using for a long time but one of the arguments he makes against calling Mary the theotokos is he says okay okay okay if you really believe it went down this way then that makes Jesus one of the Nephilim right right which is wrong and not the point just to be clear but it's also an early witness to the fact that Julian who we have to remember basically went to Seminary with the cappadocian fathers or he went to the academy in Athens with Saint Basil the great and Gregory the Theologian right and this was his understanding in other words this is how he'd been taught the scriptures was that this is how to read Genesis chapter chapter all that to say uh I don't really see these things as being sort of mutually exclusive at least on a symbolic level right you have kind of the same thing happening either way what's really important is that you have this lineage of monsters descendants right uh so yeah in either version of the story the line of Cain is the daughters of men in that equation and the result of that Unholy pairing is this race of monsters yeah and uh so that this so this is the third version that you find in the Middle Ages of sort of like Origins for like where do fairies come from and by fairies I mean Giants monsters Etc so um and this is this is for instance the uh the version that you find in Beowulf which we'll talk about a little more in a minute so um but in this case uh uh so to kind of rewind all the way back there's this there's this very strong witness to the Old Testament pseudo epigrapha in the Syrian tradition within Anglo-Saxon literature and it's only just now starting to be better understood but most of this probably goes back to a guy named Saint Theodore of Tarsus do you know about Saint Theodore tarzas he's one of the earliest archbishops of Canterbury he was Archbishop starting in 668. so this is very shortly after the Anglo-Saxon conversion and um he was born in Tarsus he grew up in Constantinople he visited Odessa he spoke and read Syrian fluently and by sort of a series of of historical uh accidents whatever you want to call it he first goes west to Rome where he lives at an Eastern Monastery in Rome and um at this time uh he this is when he learns Latin and then after the Senate of Whitby is held in 664. he is sent to Canterbury because they need a new Archbishop and so they sent him there and he goes there and there are sort of stories of his erecting what is either the first rude screen or just an icono Stace in a church there in in England and um you know all this stuff so he's a really interesting figure and uh if you look at him I mean he was totally steeped in the Byzantine theological tradition completely steeped in a Syrian theological tradition kind of kind of somebody who went to every great Center of Christianity in the in the East except for maybe Northern Africa and was able to acquire the learning acquire the languages and so he brings with him and at Canterbury he founds a school called the school of Canterbury and there's lots of evidence to suggest if you kind of look at the Chronicles and also the list of books so sometimes we don't have surviving books but we have surviving book lists yeah from the school of Canterbury we see uh that things like the The Apocalypse of pseudo Methodius are listed among books that they had access to so they were definitely aware of these Traditions there's a really great book which I have just over there but the spine is facing away from me so I can't see the name of it right now but it's something like the Apocrypha in the Anglo-Saxon homologic tradition something like that and basically it does a great job of looking at sermons books of homilies so in the Middle Ages people were not typically expected especially when you had varying levels of learning and sometimes your village priest wasn't you know maybe the most articulate guy that's fine we just need him to do the Liturgy right but um because you had these varying levels of learning in the Middle Ages it was not necessarily expected that your priest would always just be able to give like a banger of a homily yeah you know off the top of his head every Sunday morning or something like this and so it's very common to have books of homilies these are called These are called homilarities and these homilies would be arranged based on the liturgical year and the the lectionary readings and things like this so they're really they were copied a lot which means they're more likely to survive and also they are really important Witnesses so we can look at them to figure out things like well we know that the absolute latest date that this Feast started being celebrated in this region was you know in this Century it could have been before that that but it certainly you know certainly was after that yeah yeah and so uh or absolutely early State anyway all that to say so the really important uh really important Witnesses for lots of different things and I'm really interested in them a for the actual content which is which is usually pretty awesome you know and and then B because they are a good gauge of what is being taught to lay people right and so it's like one thing to say that this this stuff is uh present in a you know it's it's a library it's somewhere where monks have access to it Etc said okay but what what did the average Anglo-Saxon peasant common or whatever what did they think about the world and if you go look at the homilies you can just see hear the things that are being taught and so if you if you start looking through the Anglo-Saxon homolytic tradition you find all kinds of wonderful things um and one of the things that you find is that they were taking the Old Testament pseudopigrapha for instance the life of Adam and Eve the Vizio poly the vision of Saint Paul or The Apocalypse of Saint Paul is sometimes called um the life of Peter and Paul like all these other important kind of apocryphal or pseudopigraphal works and they were actually incorporating them into their homilies to lay people to help them understand things about the afterlife I mean the Visio Pali is one of the earliest no we put it this way there's no Dante's Inferno without the Visio poly right it's one of the earliest descriptions that we have um although it it probably relies on like the the Ezra Literature Like the uh you know second and third Ezra and things like that but it's one of the earliest Witnesses we have to kind of this tradition of like the torments of hell and this idea let the punishment fit the crime stuff like that um one of my favorite things uh in there and I think this is in third Ezra as well is the idea that Herod is forever imprisoned in Hell sitting on a burning Throne um and so it's you know it's one because he misused his kinship but there's also kind of a subtext there that sort of suggests a a uh how do I say this delicately a connection between that and childbirth because of all the children that he killed and so um you know things like this um anyway it's it's pretty it's all pretty Grim stuff but very interesting reading um it's also important for English accent studies because it's actually uh quoted and in some places in paraphrase and others in the Beowulf poem when they tried to describe the marsh where Grendel's mother lives which is this very I mean it's uh it's it's literally it's hell right this place where these monsters live this you know kind of haunted swamp or mirror they go back and they use a bunch of this stuff from these homilies that are normally descriptions of the torments of hell and they use it to describe this location um and so there's there's other stuff in there um deliberate connections uh throughout Beowulf between sigurd right the Slayer of the um and I want to say is it cigarette or Sigma now I think it's Sigmund because when the Beowulf poet wrote his poem Sigmund was the famous Dragon Slayer and then later on it's a sun cigarette um I might have that I think that's right uh but basically they take the most famous Germanic Dragon Slayer and then use language from his story and then they take language from the story of Saint Michael casting Satan out of heaven and language from his story and they incorporate both of that into the story of Beowulf killing monsters and so it's like let's tie our hero who is a hero set in pre-christian times but it's a story being put together by a Christian and so let's take the most famous Pagan Dragon Slayer and the most famous Christian Dragonslayer you could say and incorporate them both into our heroes so this is to me this is what makes the Beowulf poem so interesting is the way that it um you know it's it's certainly compiled by or or written by a Christian probably a monk probably in the early 700s at some point we'll talk more about Beowulf but um but what that Monk Is he's taking these older stories not just from like Germanic paganism but also from the sort of biblical Apocrypha like the apocryphan tradition you're taking both of those stories and integrated them so in the Beowulf poem for instance you get this idea of Sheaf or shayoff or shayafa depending on how you want to say his name and where you're from back then and this character um although this gets a little complicated because the Beowulf poet who is our earliest witness like earliest written witness to this character he actually combines him with an old Pagan character so we've got this tradition of a fourth son of Noah there's also this tradition of a guy named Shield which literally just means Shield who is the lead the mythical progenitor of the Danish Kings um he's he's the Danish equivalent of like King Arthur and the Beowulf poet takes those two characters and he combines them into a single character called Shield shaving right a shield son of Chief is what that literally means but the the the chief myth or the chief Legend um is about this young boy uh who washes up on the shores of Western Europe um back Far Far away long ago in The Mists of Time watches up on the shores of Northern Europe and uh he's shining he's beautiful he's his skin is literally glowing oh which is by the way how Noah is described when he's born in like third Enoch um and uh he's um there's nobody with him he just washes up on shore and he's lying in the boat and he's got his head resting on a Sheaf of wheat which is why he's called Sheaf and uh the people take him and they take him back up to the hall and their King has recently died and they don't have a new king and so they take this boy and they make him King and he basically brings he's a culture hero he brings uh was what is 19th century uh Scholars refer to this kind of figure as a corn King right somebody who brings the secrets of Agriculture and how to how to grow crops and things like that he brings them to the Scandinavian people so he's this weird legendary figure that's on a certain level like well attested but at the same time not where we don't really know much about him and what seems to be happening uh specifically during the time of Alfred the Great is that they take sheave which is probably this pre-existing sort of Germanic Legend um which nobody really knows when it started or where it started or how to explain it they take sheave and you'll find this for instance in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle which is written during Alfred's life of Alfred for people who don't know Alpha the great um in addition to making the Danes behave themselves Alfred the Great uh oversaw a tremendous uh program of you could say like literary renewal and Revival in uh Anglo-Saxon England and he's responsible for just a tremendous amount of of most of the best Anglo-Saxon literature comes from um was at least preserved written down preserved collected Etc by Scholars working for him he also did a quite a bit of translation himself he he translated Saint Gregory the Great's pastoral care and then he also translated the Bowie thesis the constellation of philosophy although uh when I say you translated he translated it the way people translated things in the Middle Ages which which is as you're translating if you think of a way to improve this well just go right ahead you know um and and actually yeah kind of like Alfred's better um uh well okay so here's the thing about Alfred's boethius is that um a lot of people say oh well Alfred was like because he's this Christian and he's anti-paganism all this thing he actually he actually removes all of the Pagan remarks and and and uh all the Pagan references and things like that of boethius and when people say this I just I always assume they have not actually read it because Alfred does not remove the references to paganism although he changes them sometimes to make them make more sense to his audience but he actually uh significantly enlarges them so for instance there's a very brief reference and this is actually all connected I swear there's a brief reference in boethius you know when it's was talking about you know hubris and people who thought they were doing great and then and then turned out you know things change for them right which is one of the main focuses of the consolation right so he as example he lists the the titans of old right well Alfred says now some people here might refer an example to the titans of myth but you and I know perfectly well that the titans of myth are actually the Giants of Genesis and he goes into this whole long thing about ramrod and how Nimrod was a giant and all this stuff so like he he keeps the reference but he he he's not christianizing it in the sense of like sanitizing it he's just saying ah but if you really knew about Genesis and the anglo-sactions were obsessed with Genesis and exodus specifically um if you really knew about Genesis and you knew about this other literature these other stories you would know that the titans of myth are actually the Giants of Genesis chapter six yeah he's doing Universal history he's doing Universal history connecting things together exactly so one of the things they do is they take this Germanic figure of Sheaf and they connect him to this tradition of the fourth son of Noah and then the question sort of becomes was he born on the ark was he born after he got off the ark the ankle attacks and Chronicle actually says he was born on the ark um and uh they do this because it allows them to connect their lineage so one of the earliest places that we see this being done in writing is uh in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle there is a genealogy of Alfred's father and in the genealogy of Alfred's Father which I have I have right here so his father atha wolf Great Name by the way anybody out there looking to name a son have a wolf very strong name um um uh I always threatened to do something like that every time we we have a kid yeah I used to do that too to my wife and he would just drive me crazy uh see see my wife uh my wife would call my bluff on this so I have to be careful but I like to do this to like like just like give my parents to worry a little bit but um yeah so uh so they trace his genealogy all the way back and they get to these characters and if you go look at the early uh lineage that you find in the the prologue to Beowulf you'll find a very similar lineage it's not exactly the same but is same names uh Bao the son of sheldua sheldua of hero mode of itermon of Chef that is the son of Noah who was born on Noah's Ark and then it traces Noah's lineage back to Christ so basically Alfred sets himself up as a descendant though right so this is really this is really important because uh the kings of Wessex already knew uh that and we'll we'll talk later about how eventually these two threads come together but the descendants of the the kings of Wessex already knew that they were descended from ovin times they would have called them right um every everybody knew this so Alfred's project a big part of Alfred's project and of course you have to think you know he's got a bunch of pagan Danes right over there and they're doing their own things and of course they he did kind of make them convert to Christianity but it took a little while for that to take let's say yeah two centuries that's it yeah yeah a couple of centuries but um but you've got a bunch of Danes right over there and uh so like uh Germanic paganism is present right and so Alfred's lineage that you find here um let's say it's a little quieter on the Odin Parts yeah you know but the thing that he's looking to do is really traces traces lineage back to Noah and of course ultimately back to Christ or so back to Adam so he says well and Christ because he it says you know who's born on Noah's Ark who's the son of lasnick the set of Methuselah the son of Enoch the son of Jared the son of Malachi the son of Canaan the son of Enos the son of Seth the son of Adam the first man and our father that is Christ amen so uh and this is I mean that's a deliberate reference back to The Gospel according to St Luke right so you've got that genealogy in The Gospel According to Saint Luke and it goes all the way back to the son of Adam who was the son of God right yeah and the point of the genealogy in St Luke's gospel you could say compared to the genealogy that we have in Matthew right Matthew is sometimes too big a deal is made about this but essentially Matthew's you know Matthew is showing Christ's revealing Christ as the Jewish Messiah but Luke who's writing a gospel sort of for the Greeks maybe um or at least for you know the Hellenic Jews Hellenic Believers he traces Christ lineage all the way back to Adam because the point is to show that Christ didn't just come to save did you the Jews yeah you can't just right he came to save everyone and that he sort of um by uh that that you know by this recapitulation he becomes the new Adam he becomes the new head and then everyone is gathered back under him again this genealogy is deliberately echoing that right it's deliberately echoing this to show uh where do the Anglo-Saxons fit in sort of the vast scheme of everything and ultimately where do they fit in the story of Redemption where did they fit in Christian household and what's really weird is that they go this route because literally everyone else if you look at Welsh Chronicles if you look at French Chronicles if you look at German Chronicles on the continent literally everyone else uh just traces themselves back to japheth which is what many European would do in the Middle Ages but the Anglo-Saxons and then ultimately following them the Scandinavians once they convert they they're not converted they haven't converted at this point um but they they convert and when they convert they basically learn Christianity from the English accents so everyone else at this time just traces their lineage back to japheth but for the Anglo-Saxons it's really important to trace themselves back to this fourth son of Noah um very self-consciously so and they do it without um I mean they change his name like you can't get uh from you know uh uh yonton to Chief like yeah you can't do it it doesn't work they change his name they um they ignore basically all of the uh the things that uh you'd find in like Eastern Traditions about him you know as far as uh you know there's no association with Nimrod here um Alfred actually really how do I say this the northern Germanic people they had their own memory right they had their own memory of of the war of god with with the Giants this is one of the major uh uh background pieces of the Beowulf poem right is this it's one of the major things that everybody kind of remembers happened and of course it's because they had it in their own midst and legends and then Christianity came along Christianity had it too so here's where I will say something really cool and then we'll just save it for next time uh to explain there is every reason to believe that the Beowulf poet had access to the Book of Enoch who at least had access to strong enochian Traditions um in fact I'll just I'll just like to say this wildly and like befuddle everyone including my fellow English accents there is a very strong case to be made that Grendel's name actually comes at least part of Grendel's name comes from The Book of Enoch so I'll just throw that one out there and let people like percolate on it actually if you're not an English accent that may not be a very big deal to you but if I am you're gonna be if you are you're gonna be like what the heck did he just say so uh I'll defend I'm not an anglo-saxonist and I definitely want to hear yeah this yes I would definitely want to hear how this connects together because I can kind of see it yeah and kind of see it but I don't I think I think that next time what we will have to do is actually just spend the entire video on on the Beowulf poem I think that's great because I've had to do I've had an intuition for years because I was always presented Beowulf as a pagan story with a Christian veneer no and when I read it I thought anybody who knows kind of the the Deep mythological stories that are part of the Christian tradition would not be able to say anything like that no no no no there's definitely uh paganism in there but it's it's such a perfect weaving together of things that it's almost impossible to disentangle it but I really honestly I believe that if you want to there are certain there are certain texts certain stories that are that are like the Rosetta Stone you know where you come across something that's untranslatable uh but then here's here here's the same text in a language you do know right Beowulf is the Rosetta Stone for all of this stuff it's where especially in the in the old North all of the stuff comes together in the Beowulf poem and if you dig around very closely I'll just throw out kind of one little example right um when Shield shaving you know he comes uh he's shown washing up on the shore of the Danish uh coast and the Danes take him in they make him King after um after he dies they hold a big funeral for him there are uh three funerals in Beowulf one at the beginning one in the middle one at the end very important to the story but they hold this big uh funeral for bail uh for for shield shaving and when they do they give him a ship burial but it's not like the one in the movie where they push the ship out and like shoot the arrow or whatever they put him back in the ship they laid uh they put a bunch of treasure on the ship with him and then they push the ship out into the sea and what it says is they sent him back to those who had sent him not and and earlier on uh they keep saying that God sent him to the Danish people God sent him to the Danish people it was because they were they'd had a bad King before and then now they don't have a king at all and so God sent him God sent him God sent him but when they push the ship out it says sent him back to those plural who had sent them so the question is who sent Shield shaving to the Danish people in the Beowulf poem um if you've uh if you've got this kind of weird 19th century German version of Christianity right where it's so originally monotheistic that you don't even have room to think about like the Saints the Divine counsel Angelic orders these different things then that just it doesn't make any sense and you'd have to and so they would look at that and they would say aha Christianity doesn't have them yeah and so that's got to be the piece of paganism that's got to be like like the poet was just in cautious but actually the Beowulf poet is I think one of the most cautious writers who's ever lived in terms of I mean he's very artistic and the idea that he would just make a a mistake like that is I think utter nonsense um much it's a much better case to say that well actually this probably 8th Century monk there's a little bit of uh there's a little there's a lot of debate actually about the dating of the Beowulf uh poem The manuscript that we have isn't the original it's a copy it's from much later than what it was composed so there's kind of this argument about when was it composed and when I say there's an argument there's a very there was a very famous con uh a Conference held in Toronto the University of Toronto called the dating of Beowulf and an actual fist fight I've talked to people who were there an actual fist fight broke out at the conference over this stuff oh my goodness so so it's it's it's it's hotly controversial uh but Academia like scholarship is so originally there was like an early date maybe like say age of bead ascribed to it and then uh then everybody's like you know it's a later date and now Academia is actually coming back around uh based on uh based on our better understanding of like certain metrical laws in Anglo-Saxon literature and things like this the consensus is kind of swinging back towards that earlier date again anyway I'm an early date of Beowulf guy if you're not I don't care but um anyway all right all this to say all this to say you can come uh you can come fight me um you know it's fine you know I'm not yeah I think with your Jujitsu we're gonna avoid We're Not Gonna We're not gonna fight you but um no but in all seriousness uh so this this monk you know probably probably so anyway I think Bill was most likely written by an 8th Century monk living in England yeah but you you have given me like such a gift in this discussion I'll be honest with you like I hope so I've been looking like I've been rambling no I've been looking for years to find some hook at the intuition that I have about this notion of intermediary beings and that in some ways you know the fact that we could see fairies appear in in Great Britain and you know that there was this whole structure there and I thought how do they account for that because it does look like the notion of the gender these these neutral or or ambiguous figures at least that can sometimes be tricky because they can go either way like it's not that they they can be neutral they can go either way and so this is great that they actually have this actual tradition and I think that I mean this people will wonder why does Jonathan care so much about this and the reason why I care so much about this is that if we talk about the notion that they are principalities or they're they're like there are agencies which are above the human consciousness or that gather human consciousnesses together and gather phenomena together let's say then the idea that it's only either from heaven or hell that it's only good or bad is not the one we experience we experience Agency on us that doesn't necessarily have those two polarities and so the problem is if we experience that then how do we account for it in in in our own symbolic structure how can we talk about it both in technical terms that's easier but to talk about it with a more mythological language I found harder to do because it's tricky and I see like I've I saw C.S Lewis obviously playing around with this you see you see you see people playing around with this notion but not not explicating it in a way that I found uh like uh gratifying Saint Isaac to Syrian explains all of it so uh there you go he explains he explains what exactly about exactly what you're saying exactly what you're saying yeah see this stuff is insane Isaac the Syrian he talks about talks about like the old gods and obviously he doesn't use the word fairies but uh one of his homilies he talks about this idea this and this idea that um for him it's there's like a there is a limit that is placed on how much certain principalities and powers are allowed to lie something like that um and so so yeah so he's he's uh he's got some really interesting stuff on this I will see if I can dig that homily up and send you yeah I would love to see that I'll have to go back and see which one it is but um but yeah so so this is this stuff uh maybe to kind of wrap it up here because I think we're getting close to the time that we we like to do these but um so to kind of sum all this up the Anglo the Anglo-Saxon Christians made very free use of the biblical pseudo-epigrapha and of the or you know what what you know you could call the Apocrypha um as well as Syrian Traditions right they had access to these very important early works of universal history and so when they attempt to write their own works of universal history which is by the way that's what the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is people only study it now for like you know you know Wars and things like this but you know the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle starts at you know starts with creation yeah right um um it's you know it starts with uh or at least it starts it starts back at uh it doesn't start with creation it starts with um the birth of Christ right but it's I mean think about that decision alone to say we're the we're the English people not not British we're we're the English people and we're going to start our history this is our Chronicle at the history of the English people starts with before the Incarnation of Christ 60 years guys Julius the emperor the first of the Romans taught the land of Britain and crushed the britons in battle and overcame them nevertheless he was unable to gain any Empire there and then Octavius Reign 56 winners and in the 42nd year of his Reign Christ was born that's the opening kind of the opening entry more or less in the English accent Chronicles so there so it's a work of universal history because what they're saying is our history actually begins with the birth of Christ and it begins with Rome yeah so what I'd like to talk about next time is why don't we just zoom in on Beowulf oh yeah let's do that that'd be great and I'm looking forward to that for sure I actually have some well we'll do an episode on Beowulf and I have some other crazy ideas that I came up with today regarding Beowulf and the symbolic world so we'll talk about that later and maybe uh maybe see what you think about that and see what everybody else thinks about it but um and then uh after that what I'd like to do is kind of pick up again after Beowulf and look at um so there are three things so we said before in uh Universal history that the universal history project is really you have to tie yourself back to Noah right your or the the Old Testament you have to tie yourself back to the Christian story and then you also tie yourself back to the Roman story right well the north Germanic pagans as they convert they are going to do a third thing right which is try to tie themselves back to Noah try themselves back to Rome and then tie themselves back to all of their own like God's Heroes ancestors and try to figure out where did they fit in the story so yeah because for their Traditions were in some way so strong and their memory of Their Own Story was so strong you know the the the britons the Gaelic people had lost a lot of their spiritual leadership anyways when by the time like Julius Caesar bragged about how many Druids he slaughtered like by the time that they convert to Christianity I don't know how much was left even of their own tradition whereas the the northern people had this very strong memory of their their own Chronicles and and uh a big part of it was just the fact that they converted so late yeah yeah but I think I think that'll be uh then the next couple of videos is we'll just really dive deep into the stuff because it's great I can talk about it for hours but also like there's so much it's very difficult to kind of know where to start so I hope this was too scattered for people but maybe if there's at least enough here to get people excited so if you want to know is Grendel in The Book of Enoch come back next time all right all right Richard so uh thanks everybody I think we're gonna try to get back on track and have uh yeah have these regularly again and uh Richard showed you his book look up all the projects the links will be in the description there's a lot of interesting things coming in the future you know in all our collaborations so thanks Richard for everything you do yeah thanks Jonathan
