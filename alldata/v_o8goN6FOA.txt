despite my proclivity to feel guilt which is quite substantive and despite my temperamental unwillingness to engage in Conflict not only do I not see what I did wrong I think what I've done on the Public Communication front is my responsibility as a clinician to tell the truth about what I see so we'll make it [Music] public [Music] dad nice to see you hey mick how you doing I'm not doing too bad how are you good actually all things considered I'm in Milwaukee looking forward to the presidential debate tonight that's fun um you know I'm perplexed I would say about the situation in Canada I've been thinking about it this morning as you know the the the court that we appealed the College of psychologists decision to decided that the college has it's within the college's purview to stop me from having any political opinions as far as I can tell the the um the decision which I posted on Twitter and will post in the description of this video starts out by making a case for the fundamental reality of freedom of speech for Canadians in Canada and then says but and that's always a bad start when you're talking about freedom of speech but apparently the college has the right to decide that I can be re-educated forcibly with the risk of my license essentially because I made political statements that the members of the college don't agree with and those ex those those um opinions involve two criticisms of Justin Trudeau one criticism of his chief of staff one criticism of an Ottawa city counselor and then my objection on Joe Ro Rogan to The Climate apocalyptic fear-mongering that idiot tyrants are foisting on the general population now apparently that makes makes me unprofessional and a disgrace to the profession such that I am now going to be required the college can go ahead with this to put me into a re-education program with their so-called social media experts and that's also by the way a profession that does not exist until I learn my lesson whatever that is regardless of how much time that takes by their judgment or they can take my license away and so the the court says well of course you have freedom of speech Dr Peterson but because you're a professional you're bound by your Professional Organization and apparently they're not bound even though they're a government organization fundamentally apparently they're not bound by that fundamental constitutional axom and so that shows you all you Canadians who are listening and everyone outside of the country who might be the least bit interested in Canada that shows you exactly what our bloody Constitution is worth and if adans are so daff that they don't think that that's a problem well they're going to figure it out over the next 15 years because there's absolutely no excuse for this so that's what I'm thinking now there's part of me that's thinking well look Peterson the College of psychologists is after you you've taken it to court now the judges have decide that you're wrong maybe you're wrong and I think well I expressed political sentiment and I'm actually informed and so for the life of me I can't see how I'm wrong I think I have a responsibility to say what I think and I think many people agree with that and I think the fundamental consequence of that around the world has been massively beneficial to people so I think I think number one what the hell and number two bring it on and see what happens because I will make absolutely every bit of public in a way that the college and the courts can hardly even imagine so away we go so that's how I'm doing that's how you're doing okay but good yeah but good you know I mean I didn't look the court decision was worse than I thought it would be I was already pessimistic I figured the court would take the coward's way out and basically upgrade the college for procedural inadequacy because one of the things the college did which is just beyond comprehension as far as I'm concerned is pursue these complaints that were uh put forward by people distributed all over the world who then claimed in writing falsely to be my clients when in fact they were never my clients and not only were they not my clients they had nothing to do with anyone who was ever a client of mine and so I figured at least the Court would say well you know of course you have the right to police professionals because you're a professional governing body but they didn't even do that they just basically said well of course you have the right to freedom of speech except when it comes to let's say political opinions so you know then what right do you have at all and you know it's terrible Michaela because I know perfectly well from talking to many Physicians physicians in particular but also lawyers and psychologists that no one in Canada arguably and this is also extremely strange it's surreal there's no one in Canada except me that's actually in a position to fight this because it's hyper expensive and I don't know if my insurance will cover it it's hyper expensive it's stressful it's complex it's timec consuming it could involve the uh suspension of my license um and there's not really anything that that can be done to me that's a threat I'm not serving as a clinician I don't have a practice anymore because that became impossible even though I love doing it and I'm also not very happy about that so I'm like the person who can do this and Canadians have no idea to what degree Professionals in Canada are now required not to say what they think or to lie outright so for example therapists are required by law to lie about let's say the gender identity of minors and so for me especially on the therapy side if if you're required by law and by your Professional Organization to lie cowardly you're done as a therapist because the only thing you've got as a therapist is honesty that's it honesty is what's Curative so you know it's just part of how surreal the world is and and particularly how surreal Canada is it's uh it's hard to Fathom it is hard to Fathom can I read just a couple of sentences from the decision so people have an idea of what's in here it's linked below people can read the entire thing but there's Parts like this is how it begins when individuals join a regulated profession they do not lose their Charter right to freedom of expression at the same time however they take on obligations and must abide by the rules of their regulatory body that may limit their freedom of expression that's just one sentence after another that's how it starts yeah yeah perfect that it's a great thing to highlight you know it's it's like well you have this fundamental right but well but what what rules there's what there's a rule a there's a rule is that right that the College of psychologists has that I can't criticize Justin Trudeau on Twitter that's a rule is it and if someone anywhere in the world complains about the fact that I've criticized Justin Trudeau let's say that all of a sudden that's a rule even though it wasn't a rule and of course I get to criticize Justin trudo not only because he richly deserves it in every way you can possibly imagine but because that's actually what freedom of speech means so I have no idea what the court means by you know abiding by the rules so the rules are whatever the bloody College of psychologists determines constitutes a rule after the fact given their complete freedom to make manifest any rules they want yeah it's it's beyond comprehension and yeah but but I have freedom of speech it's like do I now what do I get to talk about apparently I can't even talk about the weather you know here's here's another fact this is literally the truth people can submit complaint to the College of psychologists from anywhere in the world and so someone in the stat submitted a complaint about the conver the last conversation I had with Joe Rogan where I yeah expressed my doubts about the validity of economic pre predictions based on climate science they the complainant submitted the entire transcript right a three-hour conversation as evidence of my unprofessional behavior and the college which did not have to pursue that complaint went forward with it so like okay I talked to Joe for three hours apparently everything I said in that three hours was unprofessional and a disgrace to the to the profession so like well what am I supposed to do about that the answer is well we're going to appeal the decision I will take this to the Supreme Court I don't think that any judges will have either the wisdom or the courage to rule about this properly except at the Supreme Court level and I'm not particularly optimistic about that either I'm not optimistic about that either I don't see how you can win this without overturning colleges in general and I don't like that's not a good look for the colleges to lose this so won't the Supreme Court I know they're not supposed to to be pressured but won't they what's the benefit for them for ruling in your favor other than they support well they would support the most fundamental principle of a free Society right it's like why do you have the right to freedom of speech well the answer is is because there's no difference between free speech and thinking no difference between free speech and dialogue and no difference between free speech and problem Sol a negotiation and so and therefore peace If you eliminate that people can no longer think they can no longer adapt they can no longer negotiate they no longer even know how to orient themselves in the world and so in principle the advantage uh for the Supreme Court is that they rule in favor of the most fundamental principle upon which civil democracy itself is predicated now I don't think we have the right to free speech in Canada I think this this uh this decision today demonstrates that obviously I saw the same thing with the Law Society in Canada partly was why I'm not surprised at this ruling I've been through this before and I see that Canada's walked down that idiot path for at least 30 years so our country is in well this is where I start to get doubtful it's like either I'm wrong or the country is in trouble now to tell you the truth I would rather be wrong but I've thought it through it's like okay what did I do exactly none of my clients complained that it has nothing to do with this and I express my political opinions which I have a right to do which I believe were correct I think that and Canadians agree with this now the last poll indicated that Canadians believe that Justin Trudeau is the worst prime minister we've ever had well that was sort of my point a year ago you know and so if I can't say that and yet a majority of Canadians believe it to be true and believe me a lot more of them are going to believe that a lot more are going to believe that in the relatively near future in what sense do I have anything even approximating freedom of speech and if yeah I can't have that opinion and therefore in principle no one can then what do we do when we're stuck with a prime minister let's say who everyone has decided is the worst prime minister the country's ever had well move run if you can well this is another reason you know why I'm in a position that I can fight this because the worst thing that could happen is the college can take away my license now I already know that if my license gets taken away there are other jurisdictions that will grant me a license the next day and you know there's a real ComEd there's a real ComEd element to that because I could lose my license in Ontario and instantly be licensed in at least three other jurisdictions and so that's not going to look very good with regard to the Ontario College of psychologists well they got rid of you well and fair enough and if that's what they want I mean the other problem that the college is going to face is that and I don't know exactly what they're going to make of this but all the people who are involved in this prosecution are going to find very soon that this will eat their life so you know from a media perspective I've offered yeah well I've offered to the college to negotiate I actually have a solution in mind and I've heard the odd comment indicating that maybe that's a possibility I reached out a month ago with an idea they haven't got back to me I think they were waiting for this decision to tell you the truth and of course they're going to be entirely emboldened by this I know the solution which I'm I'm not going to discuss in this podcast you know I have to talk to them first I have a reasonable solution but um and I also know or think I know you know you might ask well why is the college doing this and my suspicions are because I've this is we've been through this before you know when Cambridge University cancelled my the seminar I was going to conduct there on Exodus I found out eventually that it was basically one person who was behind all of that there were two more that were associated with that person who are pushing the college to go after me for whatever the hell their reasons are you know maybe they disagree with my political opinions particularly on the transf front and that was the that was the tweet I think that really probably initiated all this right I tweeted about Elliot page and so I'm perfectly happy that I tweeted that particular tweet and I also think in five years nobody will admit that they were ever in favor of any of this right this is far worse than the lobotomies of the 1930s this is inexcusable you know I I read one poor kid today on Twitter D transitioner was decrying his castration fancy that and pointing out for example that you know he's a young guy he has no sexual drive whatsoever and he said well you know what what am I going to do what have I lost I can't believe I was so stupid as to have gone through with this it's like you know fair enough kid you probably should have woken up but the people who facilitated that transformation your therapists and your surgeons what Happ Do no harm yeah right I should also point out just so just so everyone is aware of this surgeons are much more likely to be Psychopathic than people in the typical profession that's a well documented phenomenon in the psychological literature now it's not only surgeons obviously you see it that in other professions as well but if you happen to be s istic and Psychopathic a profession that allows you to cut people up that's that that uh and you think well there no people like that it's like well I think they just arrested some nurse in the UK for killing a bunch of babies in her Psychopathic and sadistic Manner and so if you don't think there are people like that you're naive beyond belief and you better bloody well pray that you never meet anyone like that because they're looking for someone just as naive as you to have their way with there are countries now that have outlawed surgery for minors transgender surgeries for miners like I believe Sweden has they didn't exactly out Outlaw it they um I got corrected on that claim by Community notes on Twitter well what happened was they they've restricted surgery to minors to clinical trials which is you know it's a detail they they' backtracked there's no doubt Denmark France Sweden the UK Holland the Netherlands which is particularly relevant because that's where this gender affirming surgical idiocy first made itself manifest the Europeans have woken up to the fact that well you know what turns out that there's no evidence that sterilizing young people and cutting off their breasts makes them happier isn't that a shock yep I think this is going to BL this is an argument that has to be had right now and it's going to there's going to be such push back from people who have gone through these surgeries starting now it's already happening yeah yeah yeah you had some more things to read from the decision well there there are a couple of other I don't know if they're funny but there are a couple of other parts just to clarify what's going on it say this decision that they've come to ordered Dr Peterson as a registered member of the college to complete a specified continuing education or remedial program a scirp regarding professionalism in public statements uh the order is not disciplinary clarifies that here and does not prevent that was that's good right it's not a punishment you just have to pay for things you don't want to do yeah right I have to pay for things I don't want to do it's also not specified so that what's specified is that I have to be retrained what's specified in this specification is that I have to be retrained regardless of how long that takes until the people who are responsible for the retraining have decided that I've learned my lesson right so don't tell me that's specified and don't bloody well lie you pikers and tell me that that's not disciplinary how pathetic can you get it's like if you're going to come after me why don't you bloody well admit that you're disciplining me which is absolutely 100% obvious especially because you're also claiming that I deserve to be disciplined you know it's like claiming you're in charge in favor of freedom of speech and then telling me that well except that you know you're a professional and of course we wouldn't want professionals to be able to you know tell the truth or say what they think because everyone wants their professionals to lie to them because that's how you get the best advice and guidance obviously yeah I I think what what shocks me about this is you are basically being brought to task Over The Joe Rogan podcast one The Joe Rogan podcast which is insane um and over political tweets like it says right here a tweet on February 19th in which Dr Peterson commented that an Ottawa city councelor was an appalling self-righteous moralizing thing an appalling self-righteous moralizing thing yeah well I used thing because I didn't want to get in trouble on the pronoun front oh well I don't think that panned out well well we'll see and so far it's called cused a certain amount of trouble okay so there was the OT city of counselor yeah what other what other so uh tweet on January 2nd in which Dr Peterson responded to an individual who expressed concern over overpopulation that's how it's worded uh and your response was you're free to leave at any point the person actually said just so we get this right that there were two many people on the planet now I'm not very happy with that statement at all cuz I listen to people I listen to what people say and when people say well there should only be 500 million people on the planet because that's what the planet can sustain I think what do you plan to do with the other 7 billion 500 million they're inconvenient are they and you what do you think they should be dispensed with just exactly what the hell are you saying and if you think that there are too many people well what makes you so sure that you're not one of them especially if you're the one that's concerned about it you know if the Lifeboat is too crowded to float maybe the morally appropriate thing to do is jump off right to save everybody else not to pretend that well who is it is it the Africans who don't get to have fossil fuels for example is it people all over the world the poor people who are multiplying so rapidly they're devouring the planet's resources should they all and so I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about calling someone out on it especially when I'm doing it obviously ironically now they actually said the bloody College said the complaint was I was counseling to Suicide okay now really who is stupid enough to think that well obviously the Canadian College of psychologists and the Canadian courts so there's another one there's another one that kind of goes along with that where you're clear joking and this is what they say uh so this is from The Joe Rogan podcast speaking about air pollution and child deaths Dr Peterson said it's just poor children and the world has too many people on it anyways which is clearly sarcasm that's in there though yeah yeah well that's that's and those are the so just so everybody's watching and listening knows so you know someone can take out a complaint by going filling out a form at the Ontario College of psychologist website so if anybody out there is inclined to complain some more just go ahead and do it but the college doesn't have to pursue those complaints because they can Define them as vexatious and and just troublemaking right so it isn't even only that members of the public the millions of people that I'm communicating with let's say are prone to complain but that the college itself decided that that was sufficient grounds to threaten my license and to force force me into re-education of course they're not doing it for disciplinary reasons it's like what the what the I don't even understand what that means if you're not doing it for disciplinary reasons it's like why is it forced and why am I being upated that's like the definition of disciplinary so that just shows you how mendacious the the decision is yeah yeah and then and then it does go to outline that it's directed Dr Peterson enter a coaching program with either one or two individuals identified the P by the panel to review reflect on and ameliorate his professionalism in public statements the coaching program was to begin within three months and to be completed within 12 costs associated with the coaching are borne by you it also outlines that coaching doesn't end until you've successfully ameliorated your professionalism and learned something yeah and so and what the hell is that supposed to mean precisely I'd need a whole personality transplant apparently but there's another problem too there and here's the problem I'm not wrong so that's a big problem and I I swear I will do this if I am required to undergo the retraining I will undergo the retraining and I will tape it and I will broadcast it and then everyone else can decide um then everyone else can decide for themselves just exactly what the hell's going on and whether or not I've contemplated my words whether or not I've thought through everything I say carefully whether or not I have any grounds for my opinions you know I don't say things that I haven't thought about and thought about a lot and so I agree with Canadians that Justin Trudeau is the worst prime minister that the country has ever had and I think he's actually far worse than people think and I think that Professionals in Canada no longer have the right to express their thoughts which makes which invalidates them as useful professionals and I think they're pushed into a corner so badly that even the brave professionals I know and I do know some are unwilling to fight this to even make public statements in support of me and if you think that is the Hallmark of a free country there is really something wrong with you you bloody well better wake up and if you think that if that's happening to professionals that it's not going to happen to you well you are exactly naive enough to deserve exactly what's coming down the pipeline for you I I guess one of the problems I see is okay so you're in a good position to fight this even though it's costing it is seriously costing an arm and a leg um and it's timec consuming and it's stressful but at least you're not reliant on your clinical practice for livelihood right yeah as opposed to other people what what's the average Canadian supposed to do when they're living in a in a society like this like how do you fight because in my opinion I don't know I honestly don't know if you're you can win this I think Canada is crooked and woke very very deep down so I don't necessarily see this going in a good direction for your clinical license at least in Ontario what are average people supposed to do to try and stop their society from going in this kind of Direction CU it feels like like I moved I just ran away I was like goodbye to this country I'm going to America it has its problems for sure but at least there's freedom of speech built in there like what's the average Canadian do to fight back against this get involved in the political process at whatever level they can get involved in the school boards get involved in the political parties get involved in local elections volunteer for election start start differentiating between the false government state funded Legacy news and actual news if you can do that even though that's impossible in Canada too because now Canadians can't get news it's like look here's the rule Mick this is the rule all responsibility on the political front abdicated by the average citizen will be taken up by tyrants and used against you and so you either take responsibility for this which means to get involved in the political process or you suffer the consequences now you know a young person might be thinking well what could I do and I would say you know that's actually not a good attitude and I mean that practically because what you will find if you're young if you go volunteer for a political campaign let's say first of all you're going to learn a lot you're going to sharpen your political beliefs you're going to learn how to put an argument forward and then if you're competent and hardworking you're going to find that Avenues of opportunity open for you on the political front so quickly that you can hardly imagine it and that's partly because most political organizations are chronically short of help and absolutely chronically short of competent help and so if you stepped into the political Arena you'd learn to speak more fluently you'd learn to put your arguments together you'd learn to be more responsible you'd take the responsibility onto yourself and strengthen yourself as a consequence you'd keep the country on the straight and narrow and you'd keep it free and all sorts of opportunities would emerge for you and so that's what you do now people don't do that and it's partly also because they're taught oh you know the whole system is so corrupt that nothing can be done about it it's like well if that's the case you're in real trouble and if it's not the case take advantage of the opportunity get out there do something about it you know you're a citizen it means you have some responsibility and you're a citizen without responsibility you're headed for slavery simple as that that's how the world works if you don't stand up for yourself obviously the people who will exploit you will exploit you obviously so I don't think it is hopeless at all I think that Canadians I think that the fundamental Bedrock of our institutions is still solidly enough in place although it is threatened that we don't have to walk down this increasingly authoritarian route and you know there's some positive signs one of them being for example that the bloom is off the Trudeau Rose you know there's a man who couldn't even tell the truth about his marriage what's the alternative you know you said for example you left well there were business reasons for that too because it does turn out that the United States is a place much more it's much more straightforward to do business in the United States and yeah most people who are watching and listening will not know that Canadians are now Canadians now make 60% as much as Americans make 60% and the gap capap is growing and that's a huge difference we were at parody in the 1970s it's a catastrophic difference and Trudeau and his bloody minion Steven Gilbo Prime among them are doing he said today Gilbo said today that the days of free and plentiful energy are over well there's no difference between energy and wealth and and there's particularly no difference between energy and wealth for poor people you want to make poor people poor make energy expensive energy is work you make work expensive you you demolish the poor obviously well I object to that that's why I object to the climate fear-mongering apocalyptic lies because it destroys the poor just so that the people who are screeching about the sky fall falling can feel momentarily moral about their role as planetary savior it's like no to hell with you seriously you leave the poor alone there's also definitely not one person who's screeching about the sky fall falling in terms of climate that's having problems affording energy not one of those people can't afford heat yeah well that's exactly right that's exactly right it's it's um the people who are struggling to put food on their table and to keep their air conditioners on to keep their heaters on in the winter they're not playing moralistic games on the planetary savior side of things no they're just trying to Scrabble for forward with a certain degree of hope it's appalling to see the left support this for example because in principle the left is the voice of the underclass let's say and it's obvious that the progressives will sacrifice the poor to Nature right to Nature worship to Gaia this imaginary catastrophe that justifies degrowth for example what the hell do you think degrowth means if you you don't think that means starving poor people you're an idiot and you might say well there's too many people on the planet anyways in which case I would say then leave well is there anything else you think we should get into details about this or does that give people a good idea about what's going on we can continue updating people but this is the this is the big story now hopefully we can get this covered by Insurance because oof well insurance for a practitioner is mandatory and insurance for a practitioner is mandatory for these reasons and so it would be quite the situation if it turned out that the insurance which I was paying because that was mandatory also fails to cover this sequence of events so we'll see about that but I'll take this I will take this as far as necessary so and like if I tell you m Mick I am very much inclined as you know to if I'm accused of doing something to rake myself over the coals and to try to find out if I did something wrong and I went through those allegations at Christmas in detail and it was very stressful because I thought you know well yeah maybe there's something here and that I went beyond the bounds of reasonable conduct and I was very apprehensive there were 13 charges at that point they've dropped seven God only knows why they dropped those seven it's just arbitrary but I went through all 13 in detail hundreds of pages of allegations and when I came out of that I thought well first of all I thought how daed can you be to pursue allegations put forward by people who lied about the fact they were clients of mine you know th those should have been just taken off the table instantly obviously you can't start by trusting the word of someone who lies in writing about something fundamental so that was kind of a relief in some sense right because I thought well that sheds a pretty dim light on the procedures of the college and then I went through each allegation in turn and I think the most damning as I said was the tweet in relationship to Elliot page that was certainly the one that caused the most public trouble it's like I got to tell you kiddo that's looking pretty good now so despite my proclivity to feel guilt which is quite substantive and despite my temperamental unwillingness to engage in Conflict I don't see not only do I not see what I did wrong I think what I've done on the Public Communication front is my responsibility as a clinician to tell the truth about what I see and so so we'll make it public in every possible way and I'll bring to bear every single bit of public pressure I can possibly muster on this particular topic and we will watch over the next three years because that's how long it'll take exactly how this plays out so and I've you know we've cordoned off our life I can deal with this without it having interfere with everything else I'm doing I've talked to Tammy I've talked to you and Julian my family's on my side we're solidly committed to this I have a good legal team we have the money necessary to do this and we have the connections so if the college wants to re-educate me they're more than welcome to try but if they think they're going to do it in secret they've got another think coming well with that it was nice talking to you have fun at the presidential debate tonight I like your suit oh thank you isn't it ridiculous yeah it's good you stand out I like it very Sol yeah yeah yeah well I thought I'd blend in with the crowd tonight you know you know the Americans they're very theatrical right this everything Americans do is theatrical and so this presidential debate it's theater of the best sort and I'm down here to have an adventure you know and so and it's what I should be concentrating on and my writing you know but in for a penny in for a pound that's for sure yeah okay kiddo bye I'll talk to you soon [Music] byebye [Music]
