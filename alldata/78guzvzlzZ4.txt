I made a game in 2 days with no experience one time I tried to make a game and I read a lot of books learned about collisions started buying more and more physics books started getting really intense into collisions and everything and spent so much dang time built so many cool examples of stuff made quad trees I just absolutely loved it never built the game just was like all about the physics I was such a lame person so there's this game jaming that I want to participate in but there's a bit of a problem and that is and in two days and I have no idea how to make a game so the theme for the game is endless and I immediately thought of 20 minutes till down or the inspiration for the game which aren't game jams usually only like 2 days long anyways aren't they usually always pretty quick but still this is super cool I like the idea of endless games I like all of this this is this is all very nice you might know better vampire survivors I haven't actually played the original vampire survivors but I have played the the themee for the game is endless and I immediately thought of 20 minutes still down or the inspiration for the game which you might know better vampire survivors I haven't actually played the original vampire survivors but I have played the I haven't played the original vampire survivors I haven't played vampire survivors at all and now all I ever get is please go watch The Vampire survivors documentary and apparently won game of the year and apparently it was written JavaScript it hurts me that that's real bile knock off I know I know shameful but I got the gist of it and it does kind of fit in the endless Fe so I will go with that if you don't know any of those games basically you spawn in kill enemies which drop XP that XP gets you on levels levels give you better stats or abilities to help you survive longer and when the timer runs out you win simple now let's do it I'm making this game in good though I thought it was called endless isn't that like the opposite of endless when there's a timer isn't that end full not endless that's that's an end full game okay that's hell yeah gdau yeah screw Unity you know you know what I always say say you know you know what I say I say why is my monitor in the photo why why is my monitor in the photo right now infinitely finite and something I know about GD is that I don't know it so let's watch it don't understand the basics yeah I know nothing about G some the character can now move wait no you're not supposed to look at that because I'm on a today deadline and totally not just lazy i b an answer back for the main character and important the animations but you can see the character is just floating so let's something for it to walk on luckily this is pretty easy all we have to do is downlo a bunch of 3DS I realizer game is not in 3D modify each of them individually to fit in 3D it doesn't fit modify again it doesn't fit modify again it doesn't fit modify again it [Applause] fits if there's ever been an experience that reminds me of my time doing gay programming that was it right there modified again it doesn't fit modified again it doesn't fit [Laughter] Mona that is it right there so I have watched a bunch of tutorials and I think I got by fine to work so it should move the enemy towards you oh [ __ ] Times by negative one oh sign and cosine now I got working oh on that last one was really really hard to do that last one was using S and cosine for your X and Y values whipping it whipping it around that's actually that's actually like you have to be intentional doing a little circle around your character I did a health system and many the enemies actually hurt you but it looks boring and sess just like me so I added a juicy knockback effect I don't even know how I managed to make it look that good this be the game I play it for a few hours who needs gameplay that's over I added gameplay you can you can out shoot people yeah if you're wondering what that highly detailed AAA Graphics B is it's a part of the story that not just excuse for me to not do animations but can stand still and you can only shoot in One Direction so let's make it move alongside your mouse luckily all we have to do is get the angular measurement between the positive minus X and the ray from the origin to the point of the cartisan AR basically I cop just Aran 2 where's Aran 2 isn't that like what everybody does isn't that the isn't that the way you solve all of your game programming problems Arc tan 2 what's that you need to find you need to you need to get that Vector AR 10 2 oh what is that AR 2 it's just you just AR 2 everything GPT I don't even know where I got this from but it rotates [ __ ] which is always cool rotating is cool yeah I also explosion since they made the game orig because I'm way too incompetent to be able to create that's so [Music] good oh man that that local orbit it just does not look so good dude it's pretty great this is actually really good dude this is actually super good how far this guy got in in 48 hours when I was doing gay programming it was xnaa okay xnaa way less easy than gdau we live them for other abilities which ever thought about hosting a game Jam a pirate software is literally doing a game Jam right now or about to be I think in January technically is when it starts I thought maybe I'm wrong but either way okay it's not like right right now but it's in January go talk to him right this is better than the day before this is actually this guy has created a more complete game than than the day before I think my favorite part about the before is the fact that they commented they're like we had ambitious goals we tried really hard but in the end we found out we couldn't do it like I've never heard somebody ever openly admit to skill issues so thoroughly as the day before it was so good we we sucked due to due to skill issues I may or may not Implement and leave the main weapon be single Target I have a quick question for you what happens when the tool to place tiles doesn't work as in ended why does it leave empty spaces you Google the problem you input it into chat GPT you search it up on YouTube no you delete our time map andp for procedure generated Terin hard code values because you don't know how Map works delete code until it works and we got procedural gener terrain that was a waste of time but it looks cool so now you can shoot the skeletons and walk in an infinite World but after that what well you can spin your ball and shoot in random directions and admire the laziness that went into cre in the game and where am I going this oh yeah we need to make the enemy spawn for some reason this had who is the person that makes this faev subscribe this guy makes good videos faev this is so good this is so dang good be hard so if you want to spawn enemies at the top of your screen what do you do get the coordinates of the viewport and spawn them outside it that would make sense except the camera moves so that type of spawner would stand in one place instead what we have to do is create a p to D which I don't even know what it's used for create a p follow to D this kind of makes sense and then a marker for some reason then you modify the progress of death by random values and boom got enemy spawning but wait wait wait I [ __ ] wish it was over the p2d doesn't move alongside your camera so what you have to do is create a remote transform to T which for some [ __ ] reason moves your camera in the middle then you realign the camera and now enemies spawn inside the screen yay why did this take seven [ __ ] hours all right so right now the game is pretty much playable but there's no game Loop so I mean that's pretty simple all we have to do is look at some vampire survival gameplay and oh yeah we forgot the gambling aspect Implement XP add juicy Mac to make the pickup animation look more dopamine inducing add the progress Mar at the top of your screen fight with the layers for hours only to realize you have to move the not to the up other level [Laughter] up no no not that oh the or ordering just gets you every time it gets you every time just the worst it's happened to me more than once it happens to everybody that is the inevitable plight of all pro this the worst part this happens more than just in game programming or specifically gdau my life eventually gets boiled down to that zindex so many issues have been solved the amount of times I have like zindex 10,000 100,000 1 million 1 million in one just like it's just the wor pop up rewrite the player s because you realize it's [ __ ] impossible to manage write totally simple code to make the level up scream work make the level up bar random because gambling add particle effect with particle system because gambling okay let's it so by this point we have about 6 hours left to implement dodging and reloading six bugs finish the game Loop add the menu screen at death and winning yeah basically I'm a little off topic but I've typed the word heal so many times I'm starting to believe I'm misspelling it we have to they call that what is it that's V visual assciation auditory assciation where you start saying a word too many times and then you can't type it anymore I've done this I've done this so many times in my lifetime semantic satiation it's one of the worst things ever where you can no longer tell that you're spelling something correct oh it's a thing and it it's a it's it's painful HTM X is my favorite game engine HDMX is a great game engine I I would agree with you quickly do a main menu and add a timer for when the game should end and then reloading I put the main menu together in 30 minutes don't you dare say a thing about the art I couldn't find something similar on h. I so I had to draw it myself I got and added the stting credits button and then I realized I have no [ __ ] idea how to create a popup in G do so I deleted the credits I'll put them in the H Tut description or something I don't know anyway I put the start button to start the game and add the timer to the game if you survive past the timer you win nice job so the time ran out it's been 48 Hours of active development and I finished the reloading just in time basically when you run out of oh look at that nice J you have to wait for the reloading animation to finish I also nerfed the default fire rate and made it so enemies move 2.5 times faster based of how close you are to winning the game making the game look just a bit harder I was doubting if I should also increase the HP that way but I thought that would be too hard to play against I'm going to cheat a little and fix the hitbox even if the timer ended cuz I broke them when I added the XP animation anyway without any further Ado I present to you time fracture all right let's see was lot of fun the game will be available on each iio link in the description even though there are some freezes because of the HTML build and I don't know how to fix them the particles take around 10 seconds to spawn for some reason uh I might also include a Windows build now that I'm thinking about it and I didn't have time to add sound effects so yeah how was the experience you might ask I've tried G before and I didn't like it but this time was different I would even dare to say it's better than Unity which I ditched God out for in the past and it's uned with supportting on Linux how cool is that it's truly amazing and rather easy to create games if you understand the flow uh if you also want to make a game I highly recommend you try it just for fun fiddle around with it and you'll see why it's so like you could also go TJ's approach which is to say oh wow game game creation looks pretty cool and then write a game engine in O camel with no experience and find yourself reading up on articles about ECS all night long like that's TJ's approach from scratch I've never done game development I could probably write an engine that's what he's doing right now in O camel yeah o camel classic game programming language classic he's making an actual game engine an actual okay well TJ smart TJ is smart TJ much like me builds a project gets so far into it and then gets distracted and then guess what he's doing that oh TJ's doing it right he's even streaming he is streaming let's go like this uh twitch.tv tdv I'm going to turn down the volume for a second wait for it wait for it wait for it look at that public name engine name main libraries engine Ray lib core colel he's literally doing that he must be AFK he must be oh wait this must be a chair stream look it's a chair stream right now but he is legitimately doing that he's legitimately doing that all right let's go let's go back at it not sponsored by the way just my thoughts on the end uh by the way the two days I took for making that game weren't really consecutive because yes thanks for watching and as always see you in the next one so we are playing the game on the Windows build via wine oh wine and let's oh that look at that it's working oh do you hear those clicky Keys hey where who in here thinks they can guess what switches he has you think they're blues cuz I was I'd say the best decision I ever made in my lifetime was getting some Jades J good Jades have been by far my favorite o he got hurt oh what a rookie because it's and there we go we level up I'm going to need more fire Blues you think they're blues Blues yeah see I have Jades Jades are loud and I'm already on one heart how did that happen that's Blues 100% are you sure yeah this game is actually really well done for two days this is well I cannot I I am like I like there's the end of his procedural generation whatever okay whatever GG that's whatever uh but this is great be trying to get well done I don't know what it is but I always am so impressed when it comes to game development I don't know why game development to me just seems so impressive but for me it just feels so dang impressive anyways great video can we just go back for a second everybody go subscribe to faev absolutely absolutely fantastic right here absolutely fantastic many appreciations The Name Game Dev is always just so dang impressive a
