it is a great time for USBC not only is the iPhone finally getting it but there's a fast new version of Thunderbolt namely Thunderbolt 5 that uses the USBC connector it gives faster maximum data transfer than Thunderbolt 4 but it turns out Thunderbolt 4 isn't even the current top dog the Thunderbolt 5 is trying to beat instead that title belongs to USB 4v2 and confusingly Thunderbolt might not look all that different than USB 4v2 which it's based on at first glance in fact it has the same maximum data rate 80 gbits per second in each direction or an asymmetric mode that gives you 120 gbits one way and 40 the other so what exactly is the point of Thunderbolt 5 then well one is to provide a higher performance floor than what USB 4 V2 offers although both Thunderbolt 5 and USB 4 V2 can optionally handle 240 watts of charging there's no guarantee your ports can actually deliver anything close to that your ports just ain't ready Thunderbolt 5 though requires at least one computer port that can charge a PC needing up to 140 watts of power and 15 wats of power for accessories as opposed to the standard USB 4 minimum of just 7 1/2 Watts this means that Thunderbolt 5 can provide extra power to higher-end laptops especially compared to Thunderbolt 4 which only mandated a minimum of 100 watts and the same is true in terms of data transfer rates Thunderbolt 5 has to provide a Max data rate of at least 80 gbits per second one way up from the 20 gig minimum of USB 4 but what does this mean in more practical terms for example if you're connecting monitors storage or an external GPU we'll tell you right after we thank the sponsor of this video MSI meet the radx axe 6600 gaming router your ultimate gaming Ally it offers triband support with eight streams delivering up to 6.6 GBS per second of speed its AI qos system optimizes bandwidth usage while a built-in processor automatically prioritizes tasks for Peak Performance take your gaming to the next level with ultra fast and reliable connections check it out down below now if we're talking transferring data over the PCI Express 4.0 bus that Thunderbolt 5 supports you'll have 64 gbits per second of speed which is roughly equivalent to four PCI Express 4.0 Lanes although external GPU enclosures haven't been in Vogue for a while Intel is touting Thunderbolt 5 as a way to get better performance if you are using an egpu as it doubles Thunderbolt 4's PCI Express bandwidth while the performance still won't be the same as plugging a card into a fulllength internal slot it should still be a noticeable improvement over existing Solutions and although the equivalent of four lanes is a bit of a bottleneck for a GPU it should offer great performance for external ssds useful for video editors who need to work with large amounts of footage so what about the those 80 and 120 GB numbers we previously discussed in addition to matching General USB 4v2 data transfer speeds these higher data rates are useful for monitors the upgraded speeds over Thunderbolt 4 enable a pair of Daisy change 6K monitors and that might sound like a fairly weird resolution but it's relatively common in professional grade displays for more standard or gaming type setup you can drive three 4K displays at 144 Herz as well Thunderbolt 5 will switch into 120 GB mode automatically when a display needs the extra bandwidth but Intel is still sorting out exactly what display modes will trigger that switch at the time we wrote this video to achieve these higher data rates Thunderbolt 5 uses what's called pam3 signaling we went over pam3 in more detail in this video but basically by sending signals at three different voltage levels instead of two Thunderbolt 5 can effectively transmit 1 and 1/2 bits per cycle instead of just just one pretty cool but when should we expect products supporting Thunderbolt 5 to hit the shelves and is it a musthave piece of tech well the first devices should be coming out in 2024 but Thunderbolt 5 will likely Remain the province of enthusiasts who need the higher bandwidth at least for now especially since you don't have to have Thunderbolt 5 to take advantage of the latest version of USB power delivery if you're just trying to do something like charge your laptop sadly we don't yet live in a world where we're all using a displays on the regular but one day that was a whole video just now thanks for watching like it if you liked it dislike it if you disliked it check out our other videos comment below with video suggestions and don't you forget to subscribe and follow I want to see you back here again come on now
