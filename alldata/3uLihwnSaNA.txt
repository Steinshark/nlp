ladies and gentlemen welcome back to what is very quickly becoming the most exciting World Chess Championship match that we have ever seen and for many of you that is not an understatement you have probably only ever seen one or two world show championships but it's Yani bomnishi of Russia dingly Rand of China it's game 9 out of 14 and through eight games it is four and a half to three and a half this match has had it all okay from blunders freezing at the board back and forth victories with the white pieces disastrous opening experiments and yesterday leaked prep okay and today we continue our journey as this this match just keeps on giving every single one of these games has been spectacular results are unknown a draw is the least likely result that we are guaranteed in the game which is incredible you cannot say that for top level chess um in this game Jan now has the white pieces why does he have the white pieces because yesterday ding had the white pieces and ding put a lot of pressure on Jan in fact achieving a winning position on multiple occasions now a lot of people after yesterday's result thought the match is almost over because ding has missed too many chances the pressure is getting to him let's see well you also might remember that every time Dingus played E5 he hasn't gotten a very good position he has entered the Spanish which is the opening that he knows best but after E4 E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop B5 he hasn't he hasn't had a good time all right he just hasn't had a good time at all uh in this match and no matter what he plays it seems like his opponent has something for him and ding plays the Berlin Berlin in the Spanish is characterized without the move A6 uh and uh we've seen already this position but Knight F6 is inviting what is known as the Berlin end game after Knight takes E4 however in nowadays it is very popular for white to invest a full move into playing this and this prevents black from taking on uh E4 and this is called an anti-berlin so you will remember maybe not Yan has played anti-martials and he has played now anti-berlins against ding he is trying to get ding to play this position with Pawn on E5 and so on now here the most common move by far for black is to develop the bishop to C5 that is to the surprise of nobody and now white has no less than like five options uh White can take on C6 white can play C3 white can play Knight bd2 white can play castle I mean I'm pretty sure white can play Bishop G5 if he really wanted to White can basically play anything and over the last few years top play players have entered this position and they have had some very interesting discussions there yam plays the move C3 which simultaneously prepares these two moves and also prevents black from playing Knight D4 and now we have the move castles and castles so when you put the bishop on B5 and black is just offering up this capture over here uh you would think that you know you should probably be taking on C6 and playing you know H3 in Blackpool playing Knight D7 it's a very very complicated position after Bishop takes C6 uh but uh no just just castles and now ding attacks the center with the move D5 okay now here's one more thing this position the Berlin and the ANSI Berlin after D3 Bishop C5 remember that secret training account that nobody was supposed to know about well they've played a few games on that secret training account in D3 Bishop C5 so you know uh Jan starts seeing what ding has prepared in his uh in his Berlin defense and in his anti-berlin D5 is just about the most aggressive move that you can play uh in general ding is not going to go D6 if ding gets an invitation to play the move D5 just like in the Marshall which is what he likes in normal Rue Lopez he is going to be playing the move D5 this is a very concrete move not to be confused with cement uh although I'm pretty sure that what is actually the difference fascinating question I don't know oh and if I uh say or do anything loopy today uh please excuse me my allergies are in an all-time worst level like horrible level right now my head feels like a gigantic balloon my throat is irritated my sinuses are irritated uh it ain't good now this move D5 if white takes on D5 black will probably take back with the queen with very good pressure so instead Jan plays Knight bd2 and we have Pawn takes Pawn takes and a very weird move okay A5 now A5 is explainable because it prevents white from playing B4 it also allows any of these pieces to go back to A7 if for some reason that is necessary uh and also black can play A4 in the future like just a very very you know like black and play A4 because that would restrict the queen side so Ian plays A4 himself you'll notice that Jan is not thinking uh clearly Jan knows exactly what he's doing uh ding also knows what he's doing he plays Queen E7 uh and after Queen C2 a very funny move gets played in this position which is the move Knight to B8 essentially black is like look you had your chances you did not take my knight you did not damage my structure and you know you you could have gone here but then black would have gotten this and oh that's not possible black would have gotten these laser beaming Bishops and I I really don't think white really wants to deal with that um so instead of that we have Queen to C2 played Knight B8 and oh my God I'm going to freak out my nose is so itchy like I I'm sorry but I'm going to scream when this recap is over my nose has not stopped itching in like an hour I'm just gonna go take a nap okay because when you when you take a nap you could not scratch your nose unless you can then you're very talented the point of Knight B8 is that is no longer possible you can also now hit with C6 Knight D7 in the future uh and so on Rook d8 uh now both sides make improving h-pawn moves okay and Knight F1 both sides are trying to slide their Knights out of the center of the board to develop dark squid Bishops Knights and so on and ding is doing everything that he is supposed to do uh this is all part of his preparation but the introduction to this video is now over we are about to have an absolutely massive battle I hope you're ready young plays Knight G3 when the two knights in the Rue Lopez arrive on the king side they only mean trouble okay they do not have any good intentions for the black king one two three four this could go here and there the queen could come help The Rook can come help what's this Knight doing right like what are these pieces doing now the position is equal make no mistake but uh it doesn't feel very pleasant now after Queen C7 which by the way look didn't spend 55 seconds on that move they're still following a game in fact Mr Hikaru Nakamura himself against Wesley so had this position uh in uh the chess.com Global Championship now here young plays Bishop A2 all right as you can see 20 minutes spent on that move Jan did not get locked in the toilet he also is not pretending to think about his prep he just doesn't know the best move so he plays Bishop back to A2 which I guess sidesteps certain things uh and could maybe get something to C4 maybe Queen B3 in the future if possible I think it's just kind of like a it's also a little bit of a waiting move and trying to sidestep various uh b5s uh but uh ding plays B5 all the same so ding also on his own as you can see spending about four minutes plays B5 and is maintaining a very big time advantage against Yan and is the one pushing the pace in this game ding is going to try to instigate on the queen side and white is going to try to instigate on the king side he plays Queen to E2 which targets that freshly arrived pawn and tries to get it to take in order to split Black's pawns black says no thank you Rook to B8 I'm ready to go but Rook to B8 is a bit of an inaccuracy as you can see the 15 minutes spent on that move Knight H4 and oh my oh my Yan has a better position Jan's Bishop staring at the king the knights staring at the king the bishop the queen this is an absolutely terrifying position Bishop goes back to f8 all the way home leaving the center of the board completely so that this Knight can come to C5 and put pressure on various things now young plays Queen F3 a very subtle move improving the position of his Queen and targeting the Knight that's what chess really is it's just what pieces can see what every piece has eyes just like you alright Queen F3 B takes A4 from ding absolutely cold-blooded move just takes a pawn does not care about the queen does not care about the bishop doesn't care about the Knight doesn't care about this Knight takes a pawn because when white starts chugging over this way The Rook needs to hit this ding's entire position hinges upon the Rook hitting B2 and Yan yipomnishi strikes first by Landing a big right hand Bishop taking on H6 he has stripped a defender of the black king if G takes H6 the queen takes the Knight and ding is on the ropes probably dead lost why is he dead lost you can no longer sufficiently guard your king I've got too many threats coming in I've got checks coming in you can't take I have rookie 3 Knight F5 Rook G3 position is looking absolutely dire and Jan is on the verge of getting a two-game lead in this match so ding needs to hold his nerves a couple of moves ago folks ding was up 20 minutes on the clock a couple of moves later after Bishop takes H6 ding is now down uh how many minutes is that 17 minutes from up 20 to down 17 a 37 minute time turnaround this is crazy he plays Knight C5 because everything in his position is seemingly protected but now Yan has an opportunity here to slide back in pressure like this but Yang can't contain himself and after Bishop takes H6 he plays the absolutely disgustingly set night to G6 I have never seen something like this there are two pieces standing directly in front of the king side you can't take one of them because of the rules of Chess and if you take the other one I play Queen F6 and it's made on the next move and if you go here I do this and then I take and then it's game over Knight to G6 look at this position the amount of pressure that dingley Ren is under here everything that I've highlighted has something staring at it look at this everything in ding's position his hands are up he's like Yan take it easy it's like a movie moment now ding cold-blooded just takes a pawn I mean the soldiers are standing outside knocking on the castle walls and ding just takes a pawn says do your worst what are you gonna do and Jan removes the bishop the bishop has been absolved from its duties one of Black's pieces now needs to recapture and the pressure is only building it's building to the extent that I'm pretty sure you can even sacrifice I mean there are some insane lines here you can play Bishop takes G7 you can play Queen E3 hitting the Knight and trying to go to G5 and then there's like some absolutely ludicrous lines where black could potentially survive but he's under a lot of pressure Knight F5 Queen G3 and so on um the computer needs a little bit of time to catch up here but like there's craziness out here after Rook takes f8 white also has moving the bishop out of the way of The Rook white can also play Queen to E3 and Bishop back to G5 it's a very very big moment in this match gather his nerves he plays Bishop to G5 applying pressure if he is able to take the Knight he wins the game why because after Bishop F6 GH gf6 Knight H5 Queen G3 Queen F6 and there will be made on G7 I mean folks when I tell you that this game is handing uh is balancing itself on like the edge of Cliff for black I am not exaggerating dingley right now has to remove his knight from the line of sight and the bishop develops back I mean undevelops back to its home Square to attack The Rook now here ding has to play Rook C2 nuzzling himself in White's position with pressure I don't know why I highlighted this with pressure on everything or this I get why did I highlight the Rooks The Rook can't see the The Rook is not a knight but instead he backs up and hear something really epic happens Bishop A3 putting pressure on the Knight and the bishop is still looking here and there's a rook behind and ding plays rookie eight you know why because after Bishop C4 threatening The Rook the Knight is under attack I'm not gonna leave and let you take my knight I'm not gonna do that do you know what things planned was after Bishop C4 ding sacrificed The Rook Bishop E6 oh my goodness he is just letting Jan take he is completely aware that a rook is worth more than a bishop but if you take this this opens up a Pandora's box of complications these pawns are coming down the board I mean if something like this were to happen black would be in the driver's seat okay so Bishop E6 dingly Ren on the verge of succumbing to the pressure please bit plays a bishop move and gives up a rook just completely sacrifices Rook this man ding despite being a game down in the match and playing with black and being under pressure the whole time he's he's sacrificing a rook to play for a win I mean you gotta love this stuff this is spectacular stuff Rook B5 and Bishop E6 is legendary and Jan unfortunately takes the bishop he actually likes what he sees for black there he takes the bishop and instead he continues the game like this it is now Queen Rooks Knight and Bishop versus queen Rooks night and night and several pawns um if you count the material actually black is a pawn up but his pawns are on the a file it's still an absolutely fascinating game black plays C5 here undefending The Rook but blocking out the bishop right Rook B3 and C4 is possible in the future to apply a little bit more pressure as you see there is Rook B3 getting out of the way defended by the pawn we have Queen C4 with pressure on A4 and black defends that pawn but now Bishop C1 and the pawn is no longer guardable now if you trade would be winning why conceptually why because of the outside pass Pawn if only Kings and pawns were left the black a pawn is very close to queening unfortunately or fortunately depending on who you want to win the match uh there's more pieces on the board and not only that The Rook actually stares at this so after Knight to F6 the Queens come off and uh The Rook takes on C3 and white gets back the pawn and E5 Rook B4 white gets the pawn on A5 black gets the pawn on e4 and when the dust settles we have the following position now what's interesting about this position um is that after Rook 2a4 attacking this Knight Black Faces an extremely uncomfortable decision and this the decision is basically you can run around the board with the Knight but after I play something like Rook to G4 if you play G6 trying to get out of danger I don't actually have to move my knight and I can slowly apply pressure for the rest of the game so here dingly Ren does something extremely professional and something which separates the top players in the world from the amoebas like myself and if myself then definitely yourself ding in this position rather than running around the board like a you know with the circus or horse he plays Knight D4 completely giving up upon just like looking like a one move blunder but you know why he did this because this is not a winnable end game because this is what we call a three on two on one side of the board this is a draw whether Rooks stay on or whether Knights stay on it's actually funny it's probably not a draw with Kings King 3 verse King 2 probably the king and three are gonna win uh although sometimes even King and two can can draw that um so ding it just does something extremely professional here and just goes to this end game and this end game lasts 40 more moves why why like why didn't they just agree to withdraw if I know it's a draw why do they play 40 moves because it's the world championship and as the person with the extra Pawn you need to take your chances you never know if your opponent's going to blunder uh and uh furthermore it's draining your opponent right I mean it's it's sort of draining their life force a little bit by the way the night the Black Knight couldn't get taken it couldn't get taken because as I said Rook end game is going to be a draw rook in three versus rookin 2 is a draw in most cases especially when the defending side is in Prime position to stand in the way of the pawn if the black king was over here yeah probably black is going to lose uh but not right now and so I'm going to continue to click the right keyboard and I'm going to summarize and maybe I'll say a few jokes uh so you don't leave I told you night end game probably also a draw why is this a draw well if you think about the meta strategy here black has two pawns white has three if you simplify that down it's going to be one zero and white is trying to make a queen but even if white makes the queen black is going to sack the Knight for the pawn and then it's going to be king and Knight vs King which is unwinnable make sense now if it was King and rook and pawn that would not be a defensive strategy because King and Rook can obviously be the king king Rook versus King rook and pawn will just try to defend themselves now here you know iyan gets even this far and uh and he has a past pawn and it's very scary but again these are professionals and uh you see ding is trying to chase down one of Yan's pawns uh my thing here is gonna get a little bit laggy if I keep stockfish on so I'm Gonna Keep keep clicking by the way by the way by the way by the way King F4 here probably also holdable but absolutely no need to play into this okay because there's this in King G2 H6 F4 H7 F3 h8 Queen F2 and this is actually a drawn King and pawn end game because this is a but you need to know how to defend this and there's absolutely no need for you know all of these fireworks uh and uh and so on and then so forth and uh it took 82 moves but the players uh made a draw in this position because black will sack the night for the pawn and make a drop this was a very fun game I know you guys want uh somebody to win every single game but folks I gotta tell you for a bounce back game for ding unable to convert yesterday with the white pieces in a totally winning position I thought he was on the ropes he re-enters the Spanish okay and opening he's been getting really clobbered in this match and Jan has been the favorite when he plays the Spanish he plays an ante Berlin he plays a very very Cutting Edge line which has only ever been played once or twice look at this position that he was facing I mean ding was under substantial pressure in this game and he held his nerves and he even sacked the rook and tried to play for a win he tried to sack a rook to defend aggressively this man is not a pushover he is not docile he's not gonna sit there and be like oh my goodness maybe I could no he's playing for a win with black when he's down in the match now this one ended in a draw so after nine it's five four but who knows who knows what's coming next and if ding Wins Game 10 it's five all and uh that's what I'm hoping for because I just root for chaos so I'll see you for game number 10. get out of here
