I would suggest you know just do it take a test right look at the different Legends of Giants and see if you can find the thread of what I'm [Music] saying this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] [Music] hello everyone as some of you know we are getting ready we are just about to launch the new God's dog Warrior Kickstarter and I thought that as we get ready to uh start on this new Journey it would be a great idea to look at the symbolism of giants because in the graphic novel of course the bad guys are the Giants now it's interesting because we wrote this a long time ago my brother and I wrote this now almost 15 years ago at a time where nobody was really caring about Giants and nobody thought about that and their relationship to what's happening in the world today but now with the Lord of spirits and you know people like Michael Heiser and also a lot of conspiracy type uh people the question of the Nephilim and of giants is back you know in people's perception and has been taking up more and more cultural space and so what I thought we could do is we could look at the symbolism surrounding the question of giants understanding why they appear the way they do in the different forms how why there's so much versatility in the symbolism of Giants and what that can mean in order to look at the symbolism of giants we have to we'll take the biblical and inocent account first as a kind of standard to look at it and to understand why it looks the way that it does and what that can mean and then we'll see how it plays out in the uh in the different instantiations that they have in culture now as you know in The Book of Enoch and you know base on the Book of Genesis we have this idea that the sons of God came into the women uh the daughters of men and the result of that were the Nephilim of course in scripture it's very vague what it is like what are the Nephilim these Fallen ones you know who are these Watchers that are mentioned in the in The Book of Enoch all of this is a little vague but when you look at extra biblical traditions and Al especially how they connect even to other mythologies from other cultures you can start to understand how all of this fits together and so the idea is to understand that there's something from above that mixes in an appropriate way with something from below you know whether you understand it as angels having relationship with humans uh whether you understand it as you know the descendant of Seth that have relationships with the descendants of Cain in the end the symbolism is the same it is an improper Union between that which is above and that which is below so you could understand it as an improper Union Between Heaven and Earth no matter how you see it and so uh you know if the idea of the principalities or the angels having children with humans and you know producing offspring of course I mentioned this before father Ste the young seems to have given us a very good solution to avoid the problems that this causes which is that the these types of relationships were mediated through ritual and that the way in which someone would have a relationship with a a God or principality was through ritual sexual practice with a priestess or priest or a temple prostitute and that this is what would give a powerful being which came to be understood as what we would say the the Giants or these these these Fallen beings that are also represented at least culturally and at least in the stories as being gigantic and if you understand that that's the basic relationship you can see that across several stories and across several Traditions you will find that that is how the the they're represented so if you look at the way in which the Greek Giants are born they are born out of the castration of Heaven and the seed of Heaven Fall falling half-hazard onto the Earth in a non-planned you could say non uh purposeful Manner and then creating the Giants in that accident and so that's the that's the way to think about it is something like the the accident of meaning the side effect of meaning these are all ways to understand what it is the Giants are for and you could say also the excess of body is really the way to understand it in this case which is in some ways that the the the meaning isn't aligned it's it's not aligned towards what it really should be and so because of that it creates something which you could say has a lot of body but doesn't have a lot of head that has a lot of body but that doesn't have a lot of spirit and if you think of just different ways in which Giants are represented in popular cultures as um you know stupid kind of ogre type figure that is huge but is not very smart this is of course something that is just very pervasive in our way we understand our culture but you can see how all of these things kind of come together which is the the bad Union of Heaven and Earth the wrong Union of Heaven and Earth the The Accidental Union of Heaven and Earth which makes it so what you get is something like a lot of power and very little Direction a lot of uh you know you could call them you have more of The Accidental aspect of the Union of Heaven and Earth and this is represented of course also in the way in which the Giants are are represented in for example in Greek culture again as usually some kind of excess you know beings with a thousand arms or you know with the legs of serpents they have a kind of hybrid aspect to themselves or kind of excessive aspect to themselves and some of them are huge you know like Mass massively uh not just you know a few feet tall but like hundreds of feet tall or whatever uh and this is to show this kind of breakdown now this seems all very mythological you know and it seems all very strange but a good way to understand the Giants is something like Civilization gone wrong okay this is a way to apply the question of the Giants to something that you can understand and that isn't just totally captured by mythological story telling it is something like something above like the head or a king or someone and the King because of he's a principality right like a like an angel but in the world something that is like a god but in the world joins with a body right joins with the city makes has this large body very powerful body that uh that is aligned with him and you could say that the gigantic part or the the Fallen part right the Nephilim part of that is the the side effects of the city the way in which the systems become out of control they forget what they're for and they take on a life of their own so they become a kind of parasitical uh body that is not no longer enacting what they should be aligned towards so think of it now at different levels it's important to understand it at different level levels because if you don't then it's going to sound weird what I'm saying you have to understand something like the Fallen Angel itself is an image of that that is the for example in scripture the idea that the Angels rebel against God or the idea in the the the Greek myths that the the the Titans who are these beings created by the meaning of the the proper meeting of Heaven and Earth that these Titans rebel against heaven and in rebelling against Heaven they castrate the God and that castration that that wrong relationship between Heaven and Earth is what gives you know the seed of Heaven falls on the earth and then brings about the Giants and so all of this happens all the way through and so it's completely aligned with the idea of the Rebel angels that rebel against God and then come down to the Earth and have relationships with women which bring about the the Fallen ones because the angels are not aligned properly the relationship between the the the angels and the women on the earth is not a proper relationship it's misaligned and so therefore the fruit of that is the misalignment the Fallen ones the the the too much body and not enough purpose and so you now you can apply it more reasonably to something like a city and you can understand how that happen which is the aspects of the city which are misaligned either towards the King right towards the president towards the the marage or the the the corruption that appears there or the manner in which the king himself or the mayor himself is corrupt and is not aligned towards a higher purpose which will then cause the fruits of that to become misaligned and so what you'll have is you'll have things like tyranny you'll have corruption you'll have chaos you have all of these types of of behaviors which will appear like uh the giant so now now kind of empty your mind of all the stories that I've told now think of the giant in the fairy tale think of the giant in the popular imagination of how the giant acts the giant moves around uses power arbitrarily right will is a cannibal usually we'll eat humans we'll sit on things you know we'll break things we'll you know we'll have a big club and we'll just start bashing things around uh and is in some ways a representation of the forces of nature themselves right because in the story of the Greek um theogony for example the Titans and the Giants they kind of get banished Down Under the Earth you know the the the Titans get put into Hades and the Giants get kind of put into the ground like they become the source of volcanoes the source of earthquakes the source of all of this and again you can see how it fits together which is although now we're not in the human sphere of civilization we're in the idea of the misalignment of Heaven and Earth well all of a sudden the Earth is not acting towards purpose it is it is being destructive it is not helping uh purpose come about but is rather going against purpose and is a kind of Brute Force without head that is acting on the world and so just understanding that can account for all the different aspects of the Giants and how they you know how they manifest themselves as you know we're also writing a version of Jack and the beanock and Jack and the beanock is very interesting because now you have Giants in the heavens and so you'd think well if the Giants are these bodies without heads why are the Giants up in the heavens that doesn't make any sense right but that is of course again you just have to understand it as a misalignment of Heaven and Earth as the way in which Heaven is misaligned with Earth and you can see why it's not weird to imagine that there are giants uh that are up above you that they would be represented that way as something like leaders that are not acting towards the higher good right so a leader that is not acting towards the higher good could be represented with the tropes of a giant an OG a cannibal um you know all the different the different images that we represent as the as the Giant and so then you you have again because if you see it fractally you'll see that when the giant is represented like in the story of Jack and the beach as being in a castle up in heaven you know he's in a castle he has a kind of kingly function because he's above you in a castle uh and so then he's both in some ways the Fallen Angel and the Giant at the same time because you can see that both of those are just different versions of the same problem which is why both in the the scriptural text right the idea that the the sons of God rebel against God by mixing in properly with the daughters of women bringing information bringing wisdom bringing the knowledge of God down into the world but in a way that is weaponized right in a way that is there to give to bring power rather than to be uh a transparent vehicle for something higher then that gives the nephin that gives the Fallen ones and in the Greek mythology you have the same image which is that the Titans rebel against Heaven they castrate they castrate the gods and then that brings about the the the Giants and both of those are are fighting against the gods and so the both of them ultimately it's it's in the Greek story it's a little more complicated cuz then there's a like a kind of restoration that happens uh to avoid things from falling further down so it's not com it's it's not as clear as what you see in the Christian images uh which is that Zeus is no is not you know the is not heaven himself he not the god of Heaven he's kind of a he's kind of a figure that stops the chaos from continuing but nonetheless the structure is there which is that you have to fight against the Titans and you have to fight against the Giants and so you have the titano Maki and the the the the giganto Maki which are the two Wars that the gods have against the Giants um and then in the Christian world you have that same type of imagery which is on the one hand you have the image of the battle against the the in the heavens the the Great War in the heavens where the angels and the demons are are in a in a battle but then you also have this kind of imagery in terms of how the flood will destroy the world of the Giants how of course there's also this fight against Gog and Magog in Revelation which is uh related to this idea of these kind of you know giant monsters that that are that are uh too much body okay so that can kind of help you understand a a basic structure of how Giants work now there's another way that Giants are represented that you can help you understand what Giants are but it's the same thing it's just you have to instead of thinking about it in terms of a kind of hierarchy of authority and then the giant the the the principalities rebelling against what is above and then that giving birth to the side effects of of a hierarchy the side effects of power you can also have it in something like in time which is that often in many Traditions the Giants are represented as that which was there there before the current order and that is a way to maybe understand it more in terms of the way the Greeks represent it but you also see that of course in noris mythology and in many other mythologies where the Giants were there before us and they are in some ways a remainder of an ancient world to which we don't have access anymore that doesn't connect to our origin um you know if you look at the way in Scandinavian in the Scandinavian mythology you have this idea even that the world is built out of the body of a giant that was there before so the world that's there before is dead and now is decomposed and now we take the remainders of that world and we reorganize it in order to create uh in the to create the current world this of course is there also in the story of Noah which is that now to it also appears in time which is that the Giants appear as a remainder of the pre- deluvian world and this kind of you know broken chaotic remainder of what was there before because it is a place where Heaven and Earth don't meet which is that we have an origin of our story we have a foundation of a Nation the foundation of a of a uh of a culture of a story and that is the the the order of that world and it's the manner in which Heaven and Earth join together and what preced it is of course something that we can't understand because it's like a residue it's a remainder of something that doesn't make sense to us and that remainder and things that don't make sense to us is equivalent to the natural forces that are in the world like again of the giant that that was broken down in Northern mythology in order to make the new world and you can think about that in terms of culture so if there's a if there's a massive change in culture then that which was there before has to now be realigned has to be used as the potential out of which we're now going to make the the New World um and and that is akin to coming to a land and then finding the the land that's there or whatever is there and then having to organize it you know to plant to plant uh food to build buildings to do whatever in order to make it into now a habitable place so that is why Giants also appear as that which was there before us and so you see that in every so many cultural stories you'll just see it nonstop everywhere which is that whether it's it's Native American you know different Aboriginal uh mythology that there were giants there before they arrived that there were this strange race of of giant men who are there before uh you see it in the how the Brutus from Troy comes to to England to the British is and what does he find of course he finds Giants he has to defeat the Giants before being able to found his new civilization now that is exactly the same as the Norse gods or the the Norse world having to create a new world out of a previous giant okay um and that is so pervasive that way of thinking is so pervasive that no matter how the giant appears to us the giant will always have that structure so if you then move into a world of evolutionary thinking where humans were are descendants of apes and that now we're humans when we see our Giants that is when we encounter the Giants whether that encounter is imaginary or not it doesn't matter we will use the the same story Trope no matter what so we'll say that Bigfoot or that you know uh the different uh giants that are encountered in the Americas with like was it wendigo or all these these giants that are in in American mythology that those are Apes right they are a world that was there before our origin the potential out of which humans have Arisen and they remainders of that world right there there the possibility of some kind of humanoid creature that is not us but that was there you know before us or that is is a is a a kind of remainder of our ancient of our ancient past and so there's really no way to get around this type of Mythology and it's a good way to kind of try to connect all of the elements of the Giants together and so I would suggest you know just do it take a test right look at the different Legends of Giants and see if you can find the thread of what I'm saying if you can if you can notice how the the the Giants manifest these different aspects which is really a misalignment of Heaven and Earth and what that looks like whether it is in some ways a kingdom out of control where the power of the institution is now acting like a tyranny on us or whatever or whether it is a Savage uh giant wearing you know animal skins with a club that's eating humans all of that manifests this misalignment Between Heaven and Earth and so I hope this was helpful and I encourage you to sign up for God's dog for the kickstarter we're going to we're trying to launch around the 30th but we want as many people subscribe because we're going to have early bird specials for those who are willing to to uh to go in there first um and in this book you will really will discover you know what is the relationship between the garments of skin between you know and these Giants that appear in the first book and it's all related to matan's understanding of this question of of residues of remainders and of the prediluvian world and so I really hope to take all of you along on this trip to discover the continuation of God's dog which is called God's dog Warrior and so thanks everybody for your support and we will talk very soon bye-bye
