[Music] thank you hey guys welcome to part three of this series going behind the scenes of a documentary shoot on location in San Diego California this film is about Jose a former Soldier and triple amputee and his journey to heal mentally and physically through surfing if you missed it in part one I covered my pre-production process and part two was centered on the first stages of shooting so if you missed those I'd recommend going back and starting there this video goes over the second half of the shoot and we'll look at how to conduct good interviews how to get creative with your cinematography how to treat your subjects with respect and a whole bunch more like I said in the first two videos this series was funded by the art of documentary which I said last year was in my opinion the best online documentary film school out there I ended up meeting Mark bone from YouTube and his creative partner Michael who run the course and instead of just making another standard review to think if I still think it's a good choice in 2023 they challenge me to put their methods to the test on a real shoot I'm not being paid to talk about this and they aren't getting any input as to what I say here so my opinions are all my own if at the end you decide you want to take the course yourself there's a link in the description to save some money and support this Channel at the same time but my intention here isn't to sell you anything it's to figure out if I think it's the best option out there for documentary filmmakers and you can make up your own mind if it's the right fit for you I'm pretty sure they're closing the enrollment for this cohort very soon possibly even in the next few days or a week or so so you might want to jump on that if you're thinking about it okay with that background info out of the way I really hope you enjoy part three in this series because we had a blast making it [Music] [Applause] all right it is 3 30 in the morning and we are actually going to the beach today to see Jose surf but we've got a two and a half hour drive so there's not much to see this morning we're just going to jump in the car get straight to the beach and then hopefully have some really nice light for this surfing scene [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so after a two and a half hour drive the sun is now up and we're at La Jolla Beach in San Diego a lot of the camera work now is turned over to arrows the co-director who's doing the underwater cinematography for today I think they'll probably be surfing for a couple of hours and we're going to grab as much b-roll detail shots and then hopefully some long lens action shots as well thank you foreign [Music] get some really low angle shots and by far my favorite thing or one of my favorite things about this tripod is that you can get like two inches off the ground so anything that makes your life easier is really valuable this would take a serious amount of effort and time with a normal tripod so great quality of life booster [Music] thank you [Music] thank you yes all right so it's been a super long day we started at I think three o'clock in the morning or I was awake at 2 30 and we're finishing off with kind of an emotionally intense scene where Jose is in a lot of pain and his wife Lisette is going to massage him basically pretty intimate and sensitive moments we wanted to create some lighting that was a little reflective of that you know that darkness that moodiness but it's night time now and the overhead lights are just orange and not going to work at all so we're blasting a 120d onto the window through a fresnel mount and it's kind of creating this film Noir super moody look it looks like the middle of the day but it's a it's a pretty cool effect so I think it fits well with the scene and the mood we're trying to capture so we're going to wrap up this last bit and then call it a day because it's been a super long one [Music] who would have thought that damn you never stayed feeling a change all in myself [Music] cause I've been working okay so we just wrapped our final scene of the night it was really great before we leave and go to sleep we're gonna spend another hour at the end of the day setting up the interview location for tomorrow morning I guess when you're looking for places to do interviews I think one of the first things I like to do is ask the people if there's a room that they think you know room in their house or in the location that they think really represents them and for Jose it's uh this room which is sort of where he keeps some of his hunting trophies and his surfing trophies so we're gonna do the interview set up in here and because we have so much to shoot tomorrow we just want to get it done the night before things to look for are a little bit of depth and the ability to control light if you have no control over the light whatsoever you know you can do it but if the light shifts a lot it might kind of wreck your shot so we really like this room for three reasons the first and most important is because Jose feels comfortable here and it really represents him the second one is there's only one window so we can black it out with a big piece of duvetine and control the light all day and three because it's away from the main road at the front of the house so it should be good for audio as well so we're gonna get this done as quickly as possible and then get out of their house because we've taken up their entire day I think we're gonna have to take down a small one I think it looks pretty cool I mean there's only so many options but I like that I like the vibe feels real busy to I think this needs to come down if possible and then we're gonna those bags will be out of the way and these plastic things will be out of the way as well let me see it again yeah that's way better and we're gonna we'll put a boom in over top here yeah I think you should be like right here getting because you'll be looking here at me and you can get like a really dramatic and you can even stick them on I think you should be able to get the monopod even around the corner if you want but you can get like a really dramatic side or you could be there if you want but then you're kind of stuck uh if you take the shotgun off [Music] close close yeah okay you can take that here take a take a picture just curious I really like this I think it's going to be sweet I think we need to set deck a little somehow like you said no man I like that I don't think I need to go tighter in that yeah this is gonna look good let's show the people at home the truth I am exhausted so it has been a super long day we just spent a little while getting our basic interview frame dialed in and me and arrows are both pretty happy we could Tinker with this stuff forever we haven't dealt without any of the audio or anything like that but it's been I think a 17-hour day at this point so we're gonna leave the lights set up we know our frame but it's time to call it a night we'll come back in the morning and get all the fine details tuned in but it's been a great day but it is time for sleep okay so I am just going over the final interview questions we're gonna do Jose's Master interview today so I want to make sure based on everything I've learned about him for the last couple of days that we're on the right track and we're going to get everything we can out of him because we're not going to be able to come back so we have pretty much one shot to get this stuff actually if you haven't done a lot of interviews aod has some really great sections on how to do this something I like a lot that they stress is that you need to get to know people and keep them comfortable that's why it's day three of this shoot and we've waited this long to actually do the interview we wanted to make sure he knew us and that he felt good uh really getting deep into his story because it's probably going to get pretty dark today and if we had just come in after 10 minutes of knowing him that might have been pretty invasive we also did a pre-interview call where I talked to him over zoom and he got to know me a little bit so that's something that I think if you don't have a lot of experience aod is really great and there's actually I think also um advice on how to do different setups and different interview types and how to listen like a good interviewer so interviewing is tough and it is a really fundamental part of this job most documentaries have interviews at the core of their storytelling so I'll show you a bit about how I do it but if you need a good primer on how it all works aod does this really well so we got our basic interview frame set up last night and now we have to just sort of do the fine tuning so the the set deck if you will we're going to block out some windows get the microphones in place I actually really enjoy this part of the process especially if we have time it's rushed it's can be a real panic but today we've got quite a bit of time there's no rush and it's going to take our time and get this Frame set up just how we want it [Music] once we're all set up I think we bring Jose in get the exact position put down some tape markers for him to aim for and then I think we should roll on the empty frame and have him wheel in I think that'd be like an interesting intro to get into this shot [Music] I'm not the greatest audio person in the world but in general I think you want to get it quite close to their face in about a 45 degree angle pointing down towards them so once we get the frame set sort of raise and lower this until we get it just out of frame but yeah if there's any audio people watching and I'm totally wrong this is just what I've seen Second Hand by watching sound people work but uh let me know in the comments if I'm doing this totally wrong thank you [Music] foreign [Music] so we're just sort of fine-tuning the lighting and everything we're somewhat constricted by the space but some general rules at least the way I like to set up interviews is to have a bit more of a contrasty look on one side of his face there's no hard and fast rules to anything you can do whatever you want generally though if you're going to have a more contrasty side you want to have the character looking towards the light so whichever side of the camera the interviewer is going to be sitting have the key light on the same side yeah in terms of exposure we're going for a little bit of a darker look but in general you want to expose for the skin the skin is the most important part of the whole thing you could use tools like false color if you want to get a reading I'm not going to go super deep into all that that's a subject for another video there's a ton out there on YouTube already but expose for the skin if it's too dark or too light it's going to be really hard to work with in post so normally you want to try and get the camera lens about even with eyeline that's a standard rule kind of breaking these rules here I'm going to shoot from a slightly lower angle looking up that's maybe not the most Orthodox way to do it but I think it's going to give Jose a feeling of a little bit more power looking upwards at an angle so this isn't the conventional rule of how to set up interview eye lines but we're going to go for an effect here rather than following a rule what up okay so you're gonna be kind of right here all right come a little bit closer and a little bit this way so your white we need to change your white balance before we start no you're good there so I think the only difference is I'm going to be sitting here so you're going to be talking to me now what we're dealing with oh okay it looks pretty cool that's pretty awesome you like it okay okay cool so I'm gonna I'm gonna here's what I'm thinking for when we roll I'd like to actually include the part where you come in so I'm going to mark I mean I know you're pretty surgical with this guy I'm gonna Mark a couple of lines for you to try and line up with and then we'll do like when we actually start you can give me kind of like a little L on this one okay and yeah is it easy what about if we did you want your front wheels or you want like the front wheels just because I'm able to see it and um so like an album yeah cool right I'm just gonna check the audio then we can take 10 and do whatever you need to do and then we'll then we'll roll it [Music] okay so we just finished Jose's interview it was super powerful and we're in some really deep places just wanted to take a second and talk about how if you're asking people to share really vulnerable parts of their life then it's sort of on you as an interviewer to make sure that you have structured the interview in a sensitive way to lead them into these really difficult questions you can't just hit people with hard stuff you need to show them the respect of doing your research preparing your questions ahead of time to make sure you're asking good questions and give them the courtesy of looking them in the eye while you ask these difficult questions because it is an invasive process and if you don't do your job right it can be really cold do your work uh like they say in nod do a pre-interview call make sure you know what you're talking about and treat people like humans first and subjects second thank you [Applause] foreign to film the last scene of the day uh it's going to be Jose working out and training for surfing I just want to say one one thing that when you're starting to film your own documentaries I keep saying this word scene and it's really important to try and think of your film in terms of a series of scenes you don't just want to aimlessly follow people you want to think of moments that are important to their story and you know I'm calling them scenes but these are Beats or or moments that really speak to the larger story so this scene with Jose in the gym is going to speak to his drive to overcome physical adversity and keep going anyways and I think aod I believe it's in module two has a bunch of these where Mark and Michael walk people through different scenes that they've shot and explain what they were thinking and why they made the choices they made so if you're struggling to figure out how to turn your documentary into a series of scenes they're a really good resource okay so on the way to the gym I'm gonna sit in the front seat with Jose and ask him some more informal questions that we didn't cover during the interview and a good tip is to try and bring information out of people while they're doing something so it's not just all Talking Heads in your video and driving I found is a really good one because people are focused on what they're doing and they don't think quite so carefully about everything they say so you might end up getting some more honest and open answers than you would otherwise so if you're trying to get more story information out and you don't want to do another sit-down interview think about trying to do mini interviews during things like driving or really anything where their mind is on something other than the questions you're asking what are we on our way to go do we are about to go meet up with my trainer and train for certain [Music] a quick look from the vaccine [Music] streams dim lights [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] always another hour [Music] I Wanna Live more and more because I'm not done with surfing I want to live more and more because I want to continue to get better at surfing and the only way to get better is to continue to train continue to be in the water continue to just move and I feel like the minute I would stop working out the minute I would stop surfing the minute I just stopped everything I think that's when when I will decide that I'm done with this world [Music] okay so it is the last day of the shoot we've already kind of gotten all the core elements of our story so the interview and all the main verite scenes that we had planned today we're going to try and do the last sort of specialty shots these are the ones with a lot of lighting design we're gonna get a slider involved so a lot of a lot of setups and more artistic shots but the main part of the story is done so today is just a lot of tinkering and it should actually be really fun there's like in that you know that puffy manfrotto backpack there's like a tool pouch in there oh boy okay so the first setup this morning we're gonna try and do some really moody details of Jose's tattoos and the extent of the scarring on his body and we're gonna use a slider for that I don't use a lot of Sliders normally this is sort of a specialty thing um and like I mentioned earlier we got this one from zippon or zeppen to try out so we're gonna get it all set up and then start controlling the lighting and see how we can make this shot work so right off the bat one of the things that stands out most is these weird little extendy crab arms whenever I've used little sliders like this from the past one of the problems is as soon as the camera gets over the end the whole thing tends to shift and the ball head can't hold the weight and I've tried all sorts of little jury rig solutions for this but the fact that these come in the box with the slider I think is pretty great [Music] so right now we're trying to go with a really moody look for this scene it's going to be very dark and just to get a bit of extra texture we're going to use a smoke machine to sort of give the air a little bit more texture [Music] all right so we finally figured out how to get the smoke machine working comes with this amazing remote which makes me feel like a 1950s spy you just fire up the smoke [Music] so I'm just trying to knock down the light behind this curtain a little bit so trusty shower curtain to the rescue yet again my favorite brand of shower curtain is the cheapest translucent one on Amazon [Music] weird [Music] [Music] okay so we just finished up with our slider shots and I gotta say this thing worked great it's not perfect if you're using it at speed it makes a really weird noise I don't know how to describe it other than it's like C-3PO playing the flute it might be a problem if you wanted to use this slider on interviews but at the same time it's only really noticeable when it's going super fast so you wouldn't normally do that in an interview setting anyways the app works great it's very simple to set up these support legs mean that we never had issues with the ball head tilting under the weight and overall for the price what I need I think this is a great thing I'm going to hold on to it and it's gonna be my slider [Music] okay so we're coming down to one of our last scenes and it's going to be Jose in his surfing Workshop room she's doing some routine maintenance on the boards it's a great contrasty look with this window behind it but it's just a little too bright so again trusty shower curtain [Music] I just think we need the key light at all and I think it's going to be fine there's going to be detail I like the idea that it's like a little Moody a little more contrasty this isn't blowing out now with the shower curtain don't say [Music] [Music] if you could just pivot want the board in that's perfect so Heros is shooting Stills right now for thumbnails and sort of movie posters and I am trying to keep the dog away from him come here Zoe it's not working that well Zoe taking five to scratch this dog looks really happy foreign we are pretty much wrapped we're just packing up today mostly it was an amazing shoot I had a really great time I think it's a super powerful story in a couple of months or so I can't wait to share it with all of you before we go I just wanted to wrap up with a few last minute points about the whole experience I think there's a lot of learning lessons here and the first one would be especially if you're starting out stay local I can't stress that enough we had a five thousand dollar budget which is pretty micro uh I know it is a lot of money but the last shoot I was on was a million dollars an episode so this is a a small budget next I'd say and probably the most important thing here is to look for deeper themes because even though this is a story about surfing on the surface it's really not about surfing it's a love story it's about what community and and other people can help you overcome and how you can do almost impossible seeming things if you have the right people around you the next thing I want to stress is how you don't need that much gear I feel like all YouTube to filmmaking people kind of say this and it's easy enough to say when I have an fx9 and a you know Sackler flow Tech tripod and all this you know Cinema lenses and all this stuff but it makes sense that I have that stuff I'm a full-time professional documentary cinematographer so those are work tools for me because at the end of the day we filmed this whole thing mainly with one camera one key light and a few audio packs we had other tools but those were the main components the other tools made the job easier and probably refined the product a little bit but they weren't essential to the story the last thing I wanted to stress is how important pre-production is because when you're working with small budgets and tight time frames you can't just show up somewhere and wait for something to happen in front of you we knew more or less I'd say probably 90 of the the scenes or the beats that we were we were going for before we got here and so we were able to put things on the schedule and when we first met Jose we were able to say this is what we want to do on such and such a day does that work for you and that's only possible with pre-planning before I start packing I just wanted to take a second and say thank you to aod for making this whole project happen I love that Mark and Michael are spending their own money to fund films I think that's really cool aod is doing really well as it is and they would be well within their rights to just keep running the courses they have been but they're putting their money where their mouth is and actually funding films and that's very unique and really cool so thanks guys so I just wanted to take a second to introduce Richard who is an aod filmmaker and has been doing all the BTS content for this shoot we were just talking talking a second ago and he told me that he had just gone to an aod members Meetup and there were like 15 or 16 people there I haven't honestly taken that much advantage of the aod community did you just want to take a second and tell me a bit about your experience with the aod community we're meeting up every month it's a bunch of uh filmmakers from all walks of life have found their way to this film school yeah that's really cool um you know I know aod Prides itself on this sense of community and so yeah I just wanted to point out that it is real all right so packing up the tripod I really do want to say that I think this is a great system after having getting it set up properly and using this thing for a few days it really is great it does make your life a lot easier it takes a second to get set up but once you do 100 it is the easiest to use and most versatile documentary tripod that I know of [Music] very meticulously packed as you can see it's funny that after all the packing content I think that's going to be in this BTS Series this is how we wrap it up with me just shoving my dirty stuff into this duffel bag no organization at all don't be like me [Music] foreign [Music] big thanks to my friend Sasha to Julian who is a Red Bull rock climber if you don't know how she is who she is she's an absolute Beast she runs an energy bar company called Zen bars she sent us a whole bunch of these things down we've been giving them the entire shoot anyways I'm not here to sell energy bars they're just really good and then thank you Sasha for hooking us up because we ate this is the last one we ate all of them thank you [Music] thank you all right that's the end of this series for now when I get deeper into the edit I'm going to put together another video on how I approach the post-production side of things but for now I hope that look at the documentary production process gave you some ideas for your own work the film itself is going to premiere on the aod YouTube channel in a month or so so keep your eye open for that one so if the fundamental idea of this whole series was to put the aod methods to the test and let you guys know if I still thought it was the best documentary filmmaking option on the internet what do I think after the last four days of shooting the short answer is yes I do still think it's the best choice especially since adding on module 2 it's just the most comprehensive online course out there when it comes to documentaries specifically and it's hands down the most well-rounded course that I've seen the advice is spot on the whole way through in my opinion and even though I do a few things a little differently here and there the methods they share will 100 keep you on the right track aod covers everything from story development all the way through to the final export and in my opinion it emphasizes the things that matter the most along the way and now that the aod Community seems to be growing so quickly the course also helps create a community and a network which was the main advantage of traditional film schools in the past like Richard said earlier he went to a Meetup and there were 16 people there which is crazy and I think it's totally comparable to what you'd get in a film school class so whether you're new to documentaries or you're ready to take your filmmaking to the next level I honestly don't think anyone does it better right now the only drawback that I can see now at this point is the price because let's face it it's not a cheap course especially if you want to sign up for multiple modules but at the end of the day it's a fraction of what you'd pay for a film degree so it's all really relative if your plan is to keep filmmaking more as a strictly casual hobby you might not need something quite so comprehensive but if you're even considering going to film school or you want to take your documentary filmmaking really seriously I think you'd want to check this out to see if the extra money might not be better spent actually funding projects that's no knock on Film School it's just something to think about and like I said there's a link in the description to get the course at a discount so feel free to use it and hopefully take a bit of the sting out of the price thanks for coming with me on that one I personally had a great time if you like that series and want more BTS content like this let me know and I'll plan some more shoots soon as always thanks for watching and I'll see you all in the next one see ya [Music]
