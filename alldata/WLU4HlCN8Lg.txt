ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Grand Swiss of 2023 this is a chest tournament with an open section and a women's section and the top two finishers make it to the candidates tournament this is a massive event $600,000 worth of prizes are at stake and a qualification spot to the tournament where the winner plays against the world chess champion this is the round number two recap and we are starting off with a very spicy game Hans Neeman the man the myth the legend taking on Fabiano Carana the number one ranked player in the entire tournament this a big this a big game can't really understate it and there's going to be other epic games in this recap some ridiculous checkmates some tactical back and forth battles uh let's jump into it that's that's the whole introduction less than a minute um if you're watching this the first couple of days that it comes out you know that my my new book came out a couple of days ago and I just want to say thank you uh those of you that have ordered this book got it up to number 25 on Amazon which is crazy because it's all really famous authors up there and a lot of self-help books and Britney Spears Memoir and um so thank you and if you've gotten it uh do me a favor if you could like after this video just write a just write a nice review I mean I'm I'm hoping you're enjoying reading the book and the QR codes are working well and it's a pleasant read and it's maybe elucidating in some capacity so drop a little five star a little nice thing up there because it it actually really does help um so after the video though first let's watch the recap um Fabiano opens up with Pawn to E4 and uh Hans plays E5 Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop B5 one thing to note Fabiano has aass I don't know why I said it like that amassed a 4 nothing score against Hans deman there is clearly something here I mean these chess players might deny it but you got to remember there is a bit of a history here when the cheating scandal broke out when the cheating scandal broke out in September 2022 that's when Fabiano's podcast started it lit they L they were going to probably start it anyway with him and Christian Cilla it's called c squared by the way they interviewed me on it great guys Fabiano is a super nice guy um uh and so is Christian and they've interviewed me on it and um great podcast check it out check that out after you write the review so that's your homework after this video um but they launched it right during the cheating Scandal so he has been talking about Hans a lot you know and and he was um he was still more neutral I think than than then some folks and and whatever but uh Knight to F6 played in this game by by Hans going for a Berlin and we have Pawn to D3 and Bishop takes and D takes and this is a very very spicy position very theoretical position where black will put his Knight on D7 and figure out the development of his pieces whether he'll play Pawn to F6 reroute this Knight somewhere put the bishop on E6 very spicy position very theoretical position uh but Fabiano has scored very well against Hans uh over their last encounters H3 is a move that controls the G4 Square Knight to D7 Knight C3 developing castles and castles as well by Fabiana okay black has accepted a damage to his structure over here white has a very solid setup where he controls the light squares from the development of the light squar bishop and maybe he's going to reroute the Knight there maybe he's going to play F4 maybe white black is going to play for F5 black doesn't have another Central Pawn so he he is feeling a little bit of the pressure Knight to f8 Knight C4 and now Fabby does something interesting he strikes in the center now he spent nine minutes on that move right plays Pawn to D4 very tense moment in this game black has the option to capture but that would allow white to get the queen in the game uh and maybe Fab's idea was to take this first if something like Queen takes D6 you can go for it takes or Bishop takes and a position that looks like this uh where white maybe has some Advantage but I but I think after something like F5 um you know takes and maybe bishop takes I I don't see any advantage for for for black so it is interesting what Fab's exact idea was after Pawn takes D4 cuz instead of that Huns just kept the tension he thought for 12 minutes himself and he decided I'm not going to take on D4 but again I don't know you know I I don't know if Fabby was going to take this or just go Queen D4 and then try to improve but Hans could have very quickly tried to make a bunch of tra uh instead he keeps the tension and that lets Fab play D5 and and now we have a very different type of position position changes character uh a lot here and it's it's opposite colored Bishops like if the knights were to get traded somehow let's just very hypothetically say something like take take I guess this would be losing a pawn but let's just say something like this became the position it's very draw long-term opposite colored Bishop endgame despite the imbalances very drawish where it's not drawish is if black goes here and then takes the the the Knight on D5 like this um that is a crazy decision like because the idea is very simply if white takes black is going to just go F5 like that is the the point but that is a monster decision to take that Knight that is a huge decision because white never actually loses control of the territory and this is just under Fire for the rest of the game it this structure closely with no C Pawn resembles the nidorf the nidor Sicilian In the nidorf Sicilian uh not to make such a huge you know Divergence but it is important that you understand what I'm talking about in the night ORF sometimes this is the structure I the pawn A6 gets played you play A6 but this is the structure and there's no C Pawn look at the structure that we have in the game it's the same structure so when white ends up getting total dominance in the center he then has very easy play Hans tries to solve it tactically he's like all right I'm going to get rid of my Pawn I'm going to be completely fine but here's the problem on an open board the bishop is better than the knight in the end game it just is it's a faster piece and white has something in this end game called queenside majority so this is pure endgame stuff Bishop is better than Knight on an open board and a queenside majority so a queen trade might benefit white because we're going deeper into the end game but keeping the Queens on the board is even more instructive because now the queen goes to G4 the Queens are doing totally different things Rook d8 Rook D1 Fabiano accurately seizes control of the file because Queen d8 is a massive threat white is just too fast white is just too fast and the thing is you can try to trade the Queens I don't know how you would do that but you can try to trade the Queens like let's just say something like this again very hypothetical that is Checkmate but let's just say like A3 king f8 take take this is still always better for white because you you'll end up taking this pawn and if something like this is the position position white is still playing for a win because white has the three pawns over here but the chances are high that it's a draw my point is after this fabbi just goes straight at Han's King B3 seals out the queen look at his Knight look at H's Knight on h8 Fabby just slowly look at it wins all the pawns and now he's got two pass pawns on the queen side and they just go and Fabiano Carana makes it look absolutely effortless wins a beautiful positional game against Hans Neeman and he's back to 2,800 babano is now 2801 he has gained 50 rating points in something like a year cuz he had a slump he was 2,800 when he played Magnus Carlson for the world championship he was like 2828 his rating was so high when he played against ma it was such a high rating it was ridiculous and he's been as high as like 2851 which is the third highest rating of all time kasaro was 2856 Magnus 2889 unofficially officially 2882 Carana and Magnus the only two 2800s remaining in the world this man Fabby is on one he is cooking and uh and he's not telling you what the ingredients are I mean my goodness this man is uh he's letting the taste of the food speak for itself he's two out of two meanwhile hikaro was uh was in his own battle against ruk sadani on the black side here it's tough to win with black especially if you try to play the Sicilian and your opponent goes here um you'll remember yesterday that Fabiano uh opponent played Knight F3 that was shich Fab played for a win with black Hikaru clearly came to play uh for win and he wanted a nidor for a timonov but his opponent goes C3 you can't beat C3 that's the summary of this game the alipin Sicilian at top level is not quite a try for an advantage much more a try for um much more a try for just a solid game and a game that you probably can't lose but it's going to be tough to win Hikaru still plays for a win he still plays G G6 is not not a solid move uh black here normally will just play like KN you know the knights and and and focus on the center and there's a lot of theoretical lines some are poisonous there are some lines where white can play Knight A3 for example but G6 Knight F3 and um yeah there's a line CD Knight B5 Knight A6 you'll notice hikaro is spending no time at all Knight F6 and this very provocative approach is still completely tamed the Queens are having a staring contest hikaru's opponent is down like 40 minutes on the clock said wani and he plays Queen H4 Hikaru is still trying to play for a win he's still trying to keep the position in Balance has the cannon pointed over there but if you mess around too long your opponent's going to get a good position and um that's kind of what happened uh sadani got a very pleasant position from the opening and uh Hikaru here um was at at some risk of actually getting under severe pressure If white got to double and transfer his pieces over here H3 you know like Rook e 2 and Rook e one and very nice position for white and then Rook B6 Rook E3 Rook D6 Rook e and the players made a draw that's weird that's that's ruk's fault for the record ronuk is a great play I'm not I'm not saying he did anything wrong but uh this is not a position where Karo is going to call the shots um you know Rook E3 and Karo plays Rook D6 improving maybe already there was no way to make progress and what I mean by that is let's say what our Knight G5 okay take take take take where's the attack Black's still going to go Rook D6 where's the attack now of course if this is like a must-win if ronik has to win or the universe explodes he's going to play on but he just figures look draw against 2780 like it's fine and uh I only have 13 minutes at the end of the game he only had 13 minutes remaining so but this was hikaru's game I mean not not particularly eventful I mean he he tried to play for a win he tried to play for a win multiple times in this game hard to play for win especially if your opponent just kind of wants to be solid it is what it is so hikaro with two draws uh this game was unbelievable this was prka versus yanish Duda this game um was was was lunatic stuff y shishto yesterday won an absurd game that was against um puya idani from Iran uh where he promoted the two queens due to very very crazy player here he plays the Vienna this is the Vienna for black where you play D and Bishop B4 and then you grab this Pawn on e4 and you go back and you you basically are playing very provocatively because White NOW gets very active play Queen C2 Knight and a rook here Knight E5 Queen C2 is a rare move I I don't know this move I mean I'm I'm much more used to seeing the queen go there but in general you know that's the setup that white is taking with a knight on E5 and and then white plays Rook D3 so white tries to transfer the Rook he basically says you know you can get something like this but with black I'm going to go here here you're going to try not to get mated I'm going to sacrifice so you can get mated and then I'm going to win um Duda defends himself breka just creates an attack then prka transfers the queen he gets a very big pawn move out of Duda so now he controls the center very well he brings his bishop and he stops Duda from advancing on the queens and now he brings his other Rook so now all of pra's pieces are standing primed ready to go to create problems for black on the king side C6 it looks like everything is good for Duda everything is safe G4 just when you thought you were controlling all of White's infiltration spots right look looks like white can't really do a whole lot here everything is nice everything is good but my friends if you want to start an attack in chess you start with the pawns it's a microcosm for the real word world government governmental leaders don't fight each other they do all of these phony PE Summits they send the pawns out to battle that's really what this is all about I mean I'm that's that that's the reality of the world that we live in it's really unfortunate but this is a chess channel so I'm just going to focus on Pawn to G4 all right G4 played Bishop takes D takes to now make sure that's no longer just a little isolated Pawn in the center but it's controlling black this bishop is not going to get out this bishop is going to slide backwards duda's pieces look good but they're they're all artifacts they're just standing around look at this Knight ready to go to D6 to G5 now here comes the queen Duda is up two pawns for a moment but in this position position Bishop C2 and and and we're ready we are absolutely ready to go look there's some crazy tactics here like Rook takes H7 and then a double check Knight to F6 from the bishop in the Knight you can't go here King to h8 and it's checkm in two moves Rook H5 Queen H5 From Russia with Love or Serbia because prka has changed his Federation like a lot of Russian players over the last several years for obvious reasons uh Knight C4 is played by black Bishop to G5 5 rookie 2 G6 and prka just gets in on the dark squares three pawns down no problem Knight takes H5 Bishop H6 double check a brutal double check setting up Queen here Queen G7 and Duda resigns because King E8 Queen f8 what a game from prka oh put him in the pockets what an incredible game uh what more can you say what more can you say look at this fantastic just G4 that's when you knew things were dangerous Duda Played with Fire Duda got burned credit to prka what an amazing game oh we're gonna pop over to the women's side because this was one of the most insane chess games I think I've ever seen this is Mela Sandu uh versus Irina bulaga they're actually both Romanian it's it's a shame they make uh two players from the same place trying to make it you know into the next level for their careers play against each other but it is what it is um it's a Spanish and again uh one of the most popular openings that exists but this game by black was very very provocative she played D6 and she played F5 and this game got crazy fe4 Knight G5 Pawn takes D4 black just chopping everything in the center and then playing D5 completely not paying attention to development white has Queen H5 white has all sorts of pressure white plays C4 trying to completely explode the center of the board no Pawn no no no Pawn intended oh my God that was a double pawn pawn pawn did I just solve Society like did I just solve everything no Pawn intended that was no Pawn intended and C4 trying to explode the center oh my oh my I got to take a nap C4 B5 counter explosion take take take Knight to E7 look at black center and white can play this move Queen D4 you can't take me cuz you're pinned but I'm going to go Bishop A6 so Knight takes E4 white sacrifices a full Knight to give this check and Slide the queen to E5 with pressure here and pressure here Bishop C6 is a threat because of the pin so black sacrifices The Rook in the corner and then runs to the other side oh my God and the evaluation is roughly equal what the heck is going on Queen H7 the Knight goes to E5 black is ready with the Cannons but it's Bishop F4 and white is the one winning white can play Bishop C4 or Rook C1 threatening a Checkmate White's attack is actually more potent Black's position looks really good but it's not very easy to mobilize Queen A5 white gives a check and in this position has a winning idea Pawn to beef deflecting the queen from the defense of the Knight if Queen here Bishop E5 with pressure and if Bishop D6 you just trade everything you go here you go here and you just trade everything down you don't even have to take but you can apparently your advantage goes down a little bit but you can play like Rook C1 instead of that and if B4 by the way Bishop takes B4 then Knight C4 and the idea is just simply you opened up this you opened up the B file so B4 is like a poison Pawn if you take it white gets the B file M Waits she plays this first and then after this and then after Bishop D6 now she plays B4 but now black can go Queen B6 you see the idea of playing B4 earlier is that the queen had to guard the Knight if Queen B6 free Knight FREE Knight I mean you you can't go here because of Queen C7 so she waited a little too long and now black gets solid and let me tell you after black gets solid Black's going to start attacking black centralizes white plays a little too slowly now Bishop G7 that Queen is looking really stuck Rook h8 oh my goodness the bishop goes to seal the Rook from going to the corner but now black starts knocking Pawn to E3 F E3 removing the defender of the G3 Square now G5 and G2 are hanging and this Pawn can always come promote as well Bishop D5 black grabs a bishop and now threatening to trap the queen again Queen G7 white sacrifices the queen to get a rook and a little bit more but there's no more threats Rook B8 a move away from Checkmate Queen takes E3 as a check and the PA blocks and in this position white resigned because Knight to G3 is just simply mate what a crazy game Irina bulaga surviving like an apocalyptic game that was like you know every man woman and child for thems like that was uh all the pieces were scattered all over the place it was a crazy crazy game and it's decided ultimately by the white king succumbing to the pressure before the black king does uh I got more exciting chess for you Ali Resa fua all eyes on him like all eyes are on Fabiano hikaro and brag I mean all all of the young Indians as well this one was against Ralph mamedov strong aeran Grand Master and it's a it's an accelerated dragon with a slightly weird move order which began like an English C4 C5 symmetrical English it's now uh Knight C3 Knight takes D4 and the setup with D6 Bishop G7 and then this bishop will come to E6 I promise uh it's going to happen I really I yeah there it is so this is a very well-known position as you can see neither side is thinking too much okay B3 uh black plays Knight D7 but you know Rook C8 and B5 are also ideas Knight D7 played by Ralph and Ralph is going to obviously apply some pressure over here Queen E3 Rook C1 King H1 F6 and fua takes as much space as possible because he wants to create an attack and puts his Knight on D5 so fua has basically done everything that he is supposed to do in the Dragon he has a slightly better position black is going to rely on queenside Pawn counterplay with pressure with the rook and the Knight so also mammed off is down a ridiculous amount on the clock and he makes a very big decision remember like Hans made a very big decision when he took on D5 huge decision gaping holes on E6 and F7 Bishop has coming queen is coming but Knight you know Knight goes back to a f and Ralph is basically saying uh I'm I'm just going to wait and see all right I am not worried fuja now makes uh an even bigger decision fuja does not like this queen he thinks he can win a queenless endgame Rooks Knight and Bishop versus Rooks and Bishop I'm not sure he had to do that I mean fua could have played Rook C2 I think he was just slightly concerned over maybe black creating some counterplay down the center against this queen but there was no need he could have probably kept it more complicated but he says you know what no Queens no problem black plays A5 and A4 looking to separate these pawns to create some weaknesses alliv is like okay Free Pawn boo like okay you gave me a pawn no problem I got a free Pawn now now what would work really well for black is opposite colored Bishops I've told you about this many many times opposite colored Bishops would be really great here for black something like Rook C5 and and this position is just a dead draw because it's impossible for white to make any progress too many Pawn weaknesses and opposite colored Bishops so fuja needs to keep some you know tension on the board some imbalances on the board Rook C3 is like I'm not giving the pawn away I'm not giving the pawn away I have an outside pass Pawn I'm not giving the pawn away but mammadov has done a great job and he's got no time though he's got three minutes mammadov is doing a nice job he's keeping the position solid tight Bishop takes H4 Rook takes A3 Ali R has got nothing he's got absolutely nothing he's not getting anywhere and you know maybe he's going to overextend and blunder and this my friends is the most important move of the game in this position black plays Knight to D3 attacking White's rook and putting an eye on everything and white can't really play a move like Rook E3 because Bishop D4 so Knight D3 is played and Ali Resa gets close right completely equal Knight D3 Rook E6 mamadov has one minute and 48 seconds to make his move or he's going to lose on time but when he makes his 40th move he gets an extra 30 minutes I believe that's how chess works on the 40th move of the game you get extra time so he just lazily plays Knight C5 not calling him lazy I'm just saying it's a very you know you jump in you jump out easy probably thinking The Rook has to go and thinking Bishop F6 Knight E6 if Pawn takes I take the bishop he lost he lost the game after Knight C5 he could have played Bishop takes takes and then Knight well actually that would never mind the pawn is hanging he could have played take take and then Knight E5 or Knight F4 it was a dead draw Knight E5 draw he plays Knight C5 missing Bishop takes F6 and the point is that you cannot take this because of Bishop to B2 the bishop escapes hitting the rook and then this is a check and white would get two Bishops for rook and be winning Ralph mammadov lost this game on the final move the final move of the the game get a minute and 48 seconds he worked so hard he played a great defensive game Bishop F6 he tried to sack his Rook like to create something but Rook takes E7 and after this this this Rook is still hanging if you take that Rook I will take yours so take Rook F4 Ali Resa escapes with two pawns and in this position Ralph mamadov simply resign the game because Ali resa is just going to go here there's nothing you can do there is no checkmate uh you know Ali res is not going to hang his Rook he's going to go here this is not even a fork heartbreaking mamadov did a great job Ali Resa wins and uh he is uh he is back in business one and a half out of two and the final game that I have for you is one of the most it's an incredible developing storyline in this tournament some of you may remember how uh about a week or two ago Magnus Carlson lost to a young kasak player by the name of alisher sanov this is ramazan janov he's not even a grandmas he is also just about 20 years of age he's rated 3,000 online you'll go to CH com account he is a 3,000 Blitz rating in the first round of this tournament he defeated a 2650 he defeated a 2650 rated grandmas picho Alan picho Argentinian Grandmaster I think now representing Spain and in this game ramazan janov plays a Spanish it is a classical Spanish a very popular Spanish Knight to B8 the Brier chosen by by basam Amin who holds he's the only 2700 from Africa he's an Egyptian grandmas he's also he's a doctor by the way I mean which is just like I mean the the the utter uh you know disrespect to all of us who dedicate Our Lives to this game this man is a doctor and the 2700 he's I think the smartest Grandmaster in the whole world um I'm joking about the disrespect I'm just saying like he's he's insulting all of our intelligence he's too smart for the rest of us in this game you know he he understands the task in front of him BM he's got to take a little bit of a risk against the young kazak he plays Knight F4 and then he tries to kick out his Knight and we have Knight E3 and you know slowly black starts taking over the game it seems like but ramazan just plays Knight F3 and basically says look bam you've overextended you have all these pawns and they're kind of Juicy I might take a bite out of one of them Knight to G4 that was like vaguely Irish here Pawns are juicy I might take a bite out of one of them I can't even do an Irish accent but that just like sounded like it was uh maybe that wasn't half bad you're a dam fuing right there you go anyway B3 Queen C1 take take Queen C4 and uh ramazan has a very easy plan here his plan is I'm going to advance my Pawn black goes to fully defend against this and while you travel away from your king I'm going to bait you in take King G2 Knight G5 and in this position take take and I hit your knight but what about Rook takes D6 look at this if you play Knight takes F3 in this position I go Queen C5 threatening Rook G6 and a discovered attack on the queen and the Knight is still hanging I think that was missed by basam who now has two Knights versus a rook that's just winning for white and ramazan xal Mahana from Kazakhstan young 20-year-old International Master Begins the grand Swiss campaign by checkmating Ponto G4 upon PA Checkmate mating net against 2680 rated basam Amin and defeating a 2650 ramazan is two out of two he has as many points as Fabiano Carana this is a ridiculous story he doesn't even have a photo on chess.com because they have they don't even know who he is speaking of we got to get photos for the players chess.com please my friends the grand Swiss the story lines are amazing we have ramazan dominating as a 2400 we have Fabiano Carana two out of two and 2800 Ali resa is looking to cook he car on a little bit of a slow start but he's got seven more rounds to go anything can happen this is anybody's tournament I'm glad to be making Recaps for you if you have the book I would highly
