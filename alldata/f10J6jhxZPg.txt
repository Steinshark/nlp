ladies and gentlemen it's currently early 2023 and chess has never been more popular than it is right now hey doesn't it feel like every time you go to Instagram YouTube Tick Tock the comment section is always like he sacrificed The Rook his dignity his pet his life something like that right well in today's video I'll be sharing a game with you that was just played by two very strong Grandmasters in the WR Chess Masters uh which is a tournament being held in Dusseldorf in very good Dusseldorf is in France you're so good at geography uh this game was a 10 000 ELO game now normally I cover uh low ELO chess that's one of my uh most popular playlists and you enjoy those videos very much the five ELO chess zero ELO chess this game is ten thousand one million ELO chess where from Uzbekistan sacrificed basically every single one of his pieces to win the game it was incredible absolutely brilliant game sit back relax give me about 20 minutes of your time and I'll take you uh I'll I'll uh you know I'll take you to the chess promised land so not your back begins with D4 uh his opponent plays Knight F6 this is all very normal C4 uh kind of playing in Queen's Gambit style for the newbies uh symmetrical stuff is very common and uh that is kind of the official Queen's Gambit but the C Pawn is the best friend of the d-pawn so they go together and this move order is preparing to transpose back into a Queen's Gambit declined or play a nimso Indian if white goes here this opening became became very popular in the uh early and mid 20th century mid uh and uh pins the night to the king and now E4 is not possible because white would love to take the entire Center so instead white plays baby E4 which is E3 E3 looks good and bad it looks good because it supports the setter prepares development uh but uh it's bad because it blocks the bishop but that's okay because nowadays there is this modern approach to this opening by playing Bishop D2 now this just looks dumb like this looks like you know you're taught as a beginner to develop your pieces and Castle so why are none of the king's pieces out well why does deciding that they are going to deal with this pin in a way where if the bishop ever takes they don't have to double their pawns that is sort of the silent conversation that happens at a chessboard where you're like all right well I'd rather do this and then I my Bishop's gonna come alive and I actually I have no nothing bad about my position at all so black plays B6 the idea of B6 is to put this bishop on this diagonal uh White NOW goes back to normal development with Bishop D3 and now a move may surprise you here like normally you play B6 and then Bishop B7 for reasons I cannot fully explain to you black instead goes D5 now I don't understand this uh like I'm sure there's some sort of big fat giant meta strategy involved but like why you being like why couldn't you just like you know what I mean like what's the pro I don't know I don't know what the problem is I don't know why black has to play B6 and D5 like in some ways I think this YouTube channel has grown quite a bit because I'm really not that much different from you I'm not one of these 2700s like well you have to play bcx before you play D5 because I don't I just enjoy the games all right and I'm pretty good at talking about them so I can explain 99 of things but one percent like why you have to go here than here probably has something to do with this bishop I don't know all right and uh now white takes anyway which if you look at the database you don't even know how to access the database you probably just watch like one to two chess videos a day you don't even play that one you're probably just here because you like to hear me talk and uh and say The Rook really loudly but if you do go to check the chess database uh the move D5 and then Pawn takes D5 literally never happened before like 2019. so this is like modern chess back in the day they would develop all their pieces and they would keep the keep the tension but what modern day Grandmasters learned is that when the center is clarified like when the center is locked when the center when there's no tension among Paul when the center can't open up really quickly like right now when it's kind of like deadlocked that's when you can create attacking chances because you can't attack an opponent when the center is wide open that just doesn't make sense because pieces are flying all over the place right so white does this then plays Knight F3 and now rather than kind of developing the rest of his pieces there's even this weird move A5 to try to trade off this bishop because basically black is saying all right well this bishop is good this bishop is this bishop is trash so if I trade off this bishop well I'm very happy right like this this bishop now has no role in the game it's just gone uh but yesterday panko plays rookie eight now the lure masters of Chess those of you that were here in early 2022 before the chess boom before mittens before chess boxing before the explosion of short form content and all that good stuff uh you would know that yes you panko played this in a game in the Berlin Grand Prix against Hikaru Nakamura that was like the pivotal game that was with the game that got Hikaru to the candidates and this move just seizes control of this and there's another idea the bishop goes back now folks if you're actually watching the game on the screen right now and you don't just have me open to hear me talk I do appreciate you very much still giving me the watch time if that is the case uh this looks beyond stupid right like why is the bishop going back to the home Square well at the highest level of Chess they are not stubborn in the sense that they're like well I move my Bishop so I might as well take it's not good to give up a bishop for a knight in most cases and the thing is the bishop did its job the bishop did its job it forced white to commit a lot of attention here now the bishop comes back and black is going to start attacking the center with C5 and I mean generally you want Pawns in the center and then black is going to play Bishop B7 and Knight E4 and by the way that move would not have been possible without the last move rookie 8. so clearly yes yipanko knows what he's doing all right I mean I don't know maybe he's just really good at faking knowing what he's doing but it seems like he's got things under control and the stockfish uh says it's zero zero zero all right so he positions equal as completely idiotic as this looks I promise that it's equal now castles Bishop B7 uh everybody's developing their pieces and and and and and they're doing a good job now Bishop B7 according to the computer is maybe not uh like so you can it's not you don't have to play it right away you can still play C5 but you're gonna play that move anyway now what's the plan for white what is the plan for white here so in chess when you are deciding on how to make a plan first of all you can get the middle games master class but I'm not going to tell you how to how or how or when to do that but the free sample of the middle games master class is literally called how to make a plan it's completely free uh how do you make a plan like what do you the first thing uh the only check you have is this that loses a bishop that's also one of your only captures the other is this so you you can also attack things but moves like Bishop B5 stop being effective very quickly uh because your opponents will just stop your threat and you've made no progress and now they will just continue developing and so on so what you do is you try to look like okay uh if I had a couple of moves in a row how could I improve my position to its maximum like which of my pieces is bad and you have to just find this balance between playing with your pieces and playing with your pawns uh you would love to do this you would love it if this Pawn could walk up here and remove the defender and like look at this Advantage you have now the problem is the second you go here not only do you lose the pawn you also get forked and uh yeah getting forked is bad um so you can't play E4 but you can play Knight E5 that is a good move now you can only move a knight directly into the center of the board if it's sufficiently protected in this case it is by the pawn but if the Knight was to ever be targeted you have backup and the thing about attacking someone when they're castled on the same side as you is you have to use your pieces open Rook Bishop hitting this queen coming and sooner than later the attack breaks through you you need to have two more attacking pieces then they have defending pieces that is my rule of thumb so C5 F4 Knight C6 and black is trying to remove this Knight this Knight is like uh is like a blockage of the artery okay for black it's very very painful and if white does this all Advantage is gone not only is the advantage gone black is much much better now because you lost your blockage right and next move what black is going to go here black is going to shove you backwards start advancing and just play Knight E4 and block your entire position so the point is this Knight must stay but your Center is under pressure so a very nice move here Knight E2 undeveloping the Knight sometimes in life you need to take one step back to take two steps forward well you go back and you might Gallop over here all right in this position the move that is played the most is this one Rook C8 now the move in the game was Knight E4 but I am just going to show you one completely stupid line that I found in the database because you made it this far in the video and I want to reward you so I found a move here that goes like this I don't think you're ready for this really I promise I do not think that you are ready for this so in this position uh the most common move is Bishop takes four all right Pawn takes C4 Knight takes F7 King takes F7 Queen to B3 check C4 sacrificing the pawn okay then there is Queen takes C4 then there is King to G6 then there is F5 check then there is King H6 then there is Bishop G3 looking for this then there is Knight E5 hitting this so the queen yeah what what is happening the bishop comes back to attack the Queen the queen comes back to E6 Bishop F6 Bishop F4 check G5 discovered check the king runs to G7 the to H3 this is all a line and I think it just ends in like a repetition of excuse me in a repetition of moves oh there is so many insane lines that all have this crazy attack that builds up on the king with Bishop G3 and Bishop F4 however as I said Rook C8 did not happen in the game what happened in the game was Knight E4 white went Here and Now folks it's time for 10 000 ELO level chess in this position black played Knight takes D2 now if I asked you what is the best move in this position most of you would say queen takes Knight and most of you would be right that's like type for second kind of but the best move in this position is to sacrifice the bishop so you do not take the First bishop back and instead you give away two he has sacrificed two Bishops to give a check King G8 Queen F7 and it looks like it's just the repetition of moves check check draw in fact there was a Blitz game online that I found between two very good Grandmasters that ended in a repetition of moves exactly like this okay what they didn't know is that actually after Knight to G6 check and Knight to H5 white is winning found a line where he doesn't take back one Bishop gives away a second bishop and then proceeds to sacrifice The Rook if you take this it's night f a check and queen G7 mate so Knight H5 threatens Checkmate in two with this and queen G7 the only move that does not lose here for black is Rook E6 Rook E6 sacrifices The Rook back if you take the Rook then you now no longer see mate and it would be Knight F1 Rook F1 Queen E8 and the game goes on the game goes on and it's very sharp it's very complicated but rookie 6 and the game goes on nodular Beck plays [ __ ] he doesn't even take the Rook instead he attacks it with his pawn and now the idea is to take it and just keep going just not leave not leave the position any sacrificing his own drug so black takes why does now sacrifice two Bishops and a rook two Bishops two Bishops and a rook all right two Bishops and a rook now you're getting the Rook back no you're not he's refusing to take the Rook he's just refusing to take it the Rook is just hanging I mean have you what how many of us would not take that Rook it's hanging two ways how do you not play F takes E6 because Queen G5 and now if Knight takes f8 Rook Cafe and the maid is stopped and I got bad news for you black is attacking white and that's a big problem and that's why rookie 6 is so effective because the queen comes to guard mate so Rook F1 now in this position according to the computer black had to find Queen E8 that move would have maybe held on and then there's a line Knight takes Queen takes Pawn takes Queen takes Rook takes Bishop moves Knight check King moves Knight here Pawn takes 97 D takes Knight takes 94 97 92 King h194 and apparently it's equal I I uh both guys are moves away from promoting one guy has a rook the other guy doesn't I don't know how this is equal Rook C3 if you play E2 then I have rookie three it's apparently losing again so this is extremely complicated and black had to find Bishop D3 shielding I mean this is what we call dank this is dank too dank way too dank no instead of that black one here remember what's our count he sacrificed two Bishops and a rook it ain't gonna stop anytime soon as he proceeds to also give up his night add it to the count two Bishops a rook and a knight for free he finally took the Rook Queen takes H5 but the attack does not stop Rook up to F3 you need two more attacking pieces than they have Defenders and in this case you kind of have that because you can't really call this bishop much of a king Defender the king is glued on the edge of the board isn't this completely insane black is literally up two full pieces but because the king is just unable to communicate with anybody he's just being beaten up these dudes are on vacation it's like if the Secret Service just left the president they were just gone all right so Rook F3 black takes on D4 he's got nothing else but if you'd rush if you play this move now take take white doesn't have enough pieces to win oh my God white just doesn't have enough pieces to win white does have enough pieces to lose so you play Rook F3 and you can't even play Rook H3 white to move what's the only winning move here for white well it's ten thousand ELO chess of course not your back finds it queen queen F7 the idea of Queen F7 is multi Knight takes f8 check discovered attack on the queen and if you move the queen I'm gonna take everything and still win your queen queen F7 is a brutal brutal move Bishop D6 played now Knight f8 he sacrifices his second Knight he has now sacrificed two Bishops two knights and a rook to win the queen and now F6 the only winning move again the only winning move there is no time to chase a mate there is no mate the king will escape F6 is threatening to bust open the position and F7 so now black goes here Rook at five G6 you pin the pawn to the to the king so it cannot take the rook and folks two nights two Bishops one Rook well make it both Rooks he has now sacrificed literally his entire Armada of pieces that's not a queen or a king he sacrificed every piece and the idea of rookie five is once again multi yes if you take the Rook it's not this I'm gonna mate you so rookie five but the idea is still to sacrifice The Rook why because at the end of the day the best players in the world know something you don't need to checkmate if you use your monster attack to win an end game you still win a queen can beat a rook and a bishop as long as it has a tiny bit of help it just needs a little bit of Pawn imbalance you see rook and Bishop Mt Versa Queen drawn but with pawns on the board you'll go hunt the pawns and promote and you're just gonna promote your pawns so the queen slides over and lose pieces alright loose pieces any time that black is gonna run away there's Queen C7 all these pieces will be attacked nod your back advances make sure that he has a loft for his King and now the pawns anchor together and this is over because as long as the queen sneaks in back here it's GG so the white king Runs Out escapes the checks and yesupengo resigns because he's not gonna be able to stop this what a game what a game from Knight to E5 to F4 and one misstep he took his bishop and my man nojibek said my Bishop my Bishop here's a box of chess pieces choose what you want this wasn't scripted I just thought of this on the spot take you want my neck take it you're on my route take it to take all my pieces because I don't need them I'm sacrificing everybody because at the end of the day I'm gonna get your queen and at the end of the game when I sacrifice my whole Army I'm also gonna get your king G G and with this game
