ladies and gentlemen how many of you remember the great big chess Scandal that happened in September October 2022 between Magnus Carlson and Hans Neiman probably a lot of you uh some of you got into chess in January of 2023 there was this recent surge so you might not know what I'm talking about but uh after you watch this video you can familiarize yourself uh with that massive Scandal and actually a massive component of that Scandal is still pending which is the lawsuit there's a great big lawsuit out there uh filed by Hans ziemann uh against Magnus Carlson and others and Hans has sort of laid low since then he can't really get on a microphone and say anything he wants because things there's a legal component to all this but you know what Hans Lehman can do he can play chess and he's been playing chess as recently as a couple of days ago in Menorca in Spain he played in the Minorca open and in this video I'm going to show you three really amazing games of Chess that he played and he tied for first he tied for first place in this tournament uh and posted a very strong performance of 2700 and is top 30 in the world in chess Hans Lehman is the 30th ranked chess player in the world and he's like 19. all right maybe he's turning 20. um he played really really well and we're still waiting to see what happens with the lawsuit and if none if all those words are meaningless because you're so new and fresh to the Chess World familiar familiarize yourself uh with that story I'm gonna show you three games that he played uh the first one is against Grandmaster Yuri salad uh from uh Ukraine uh Hans played a Sicilian Defense he was busting out the Sicilian quite a bit in this tournament Knight F3 Knight C6 and it was a classical Sicilian with the move D6 of course here black can choose uh to play this vashnikov but this is one of the most reliable openings and now Bishop G5 is known as the Richter Rouser variation uh an extremely extremely aggressive way for white to play Queen D2 long castles is on the cards black often times plays like a slingshot the Bishops stand behind the pawns very passive but also very massive and uh Hans plays Bishop D7 he doesn't play E6 so he doesn't make sure that he can take back with the queen he actually doesn't mind getting his Pawn structure damage like this now a move here that would be very bad is e takes F6 because that would leave white with a monster outpost on the D5 square and now pose being a square on the opponent side of the board frequently that cannot be fought for uh and where you can plan to piece and exert a lot of pressure and also this would be a terrible weakness so Hans plays G takes F6 and then he plays this move H5 now I don't understand something about Chess like I I watched these top players play and I'm like what H5 all right Bishop D7 Knights I mean if I had a student playing like this I would yell at them but you know I'm watching these Grand Masters play I'm like all right well they must know what they're talking about uh black wants to instigate over here potentially uh black also uh would in some point in the future like to play Bishop H6 like that would be really nice um and also white has to make a move so white plays Bishop B5 uh Hans plays Queen C7 and queen C7 is a very funny move because you can be attacked and queen A5 doesn't actually win anything because you can't take this that would be very tragic so the players actually repeat moves here essentially white is like yeah I'm fine drawing you I got no I got no beef let's make a draw dude Hans is like I'm 230 220 points higher rated so I I gotta play uh A6 and we're gonna have Bishops versus Knights so white has an advantage here why does white have an advantage white has a much better Pawn structure doesn't have double pawns no no lone or H Pawn black is also kind of stuck in development like if black wants to play uh for development he's gonna have to play E6 which will weaken his pawns to kick out this knight uh White has Queen D3 and just sort of very natural piece play the bishop has to go back to D7 you see Hans kind of going back and forth and back and forth white making good progress Queen to C7 now what white should do here is probably long Castle but he plays F5 which is probably fine and we have the following position and still when you look at it visually I mean I love White's position I love it I love White's position why do I love it so much because he's gonna go here he's gonna put pressure on the f file if this Pawn ever goes to E5 uh black is just positionally dead lost after Knight D5 just completely that lost so um again like it it takes somebody with a very decent nervous system to play chess in this position with black Hans plays King B8 always a good move sidestep off the C file could potentially attack here could potentially play B5 if he wants Rook F1 Bishop B7 and this is a typical classical Sicilian black is just rock solid with those Bishops defending all the pawns but I gotta tell you visually I mean this just if you could hit the pause button right here the chess Gods would just give the win to white but you still got to play chess and white plays Rook F3 multi-purpose move potentially going this way and potentially going that way which could prove to be more fatal because of course the monarch is over there uh black plays Bishop C8 and that simultaneously defends the position could potentially prepare the move D5 and here white plays Rook G3 clearly going down to G7 right that's that's sort of the plan um now if Hans succeeds in playing D5 he's gonna win the game what does that mean well hanza's two Bishops right so the Bishops really like open space and white has what we what I've been describing is kind of like an advantage of positional Advantage he has a lot of benefits he has more activity more space slightly better future peace prospects because of the nature of the closed position the way you deal with a person that has a positional advantage against you um is you punch them straight in the face and that generally in chess can even things out now you may or may not be accused of battery and uh getting some severe trouble so I'm not condoning that but another way uh when you don't want to resort to physical violence uh to deal with somebody that has a positional advantage against you is you play dynamically so you play in a way that muddies the waters and as you're gonna see here Han starts attacking him with that age Pawn which I told you a long time ago could be useful uh and and then and then Hans pure plays the move D5 uh and it just took a matter of moves but let me tell you everything's about to open up the Bishops are going to come alive the queen hello this is one thing you got to get better at as a chess player realizing that when one piece moves it affects the whole board literally one Pawn push opens the bishop the queen and the rook and by weakening that it's going to open up this side as well and White's positioning is the first Domino to fall now here's something really weird happens and I don't think the game proceeded like this I think the board malfunctioned now Hans went on to win this game and clearly as you can see here he did it in a sophisticated way by opening up the position against his opponent's advantages but yeah the the the relay now says Rook to D1 and then Hans takes here losing all his advantage then it says that white hangs a rook this is just free Rook H5 is played however so then white hangs the Knight which doesn't get taken and then hangs his Queen and then goes here and then this is free again Knight F5 back that's free Rook H3 hangs a rook Knight G3 hangs a knight rookie 4 hangs a rook three different ways and the game ends now listen I don't mean it I don't mean to be a hater but I don't think any of that happened um I don't think the players just played like a very sophisticated game and all of a sudden you know played like they were on a really really really bad trip um but yeah uh Hans won this game I just wanted to show this because it had a hilarious you know malfunction at the end but but Hans one and it was it was a nice game it was a nice little game um but the next the next two games had no board errors and and they really they really were special uh they they these two games were Sensational uh hunting opponent after uh Yuri was uh was a strong Turkish Grandmaster and this game is has a special place in the chess world's heart this game in particular because it has the exact same 10 moves as the very famous chess speaks for itself game where Hans beat Magnus in Miami in the FTX crypto club uh and it started with a russellimo sicilian with Bishop to B5 and then white just delayed the capture on C6 for a very long time and black is playing in a very provocative way allowing white to move the pawn into the center of the board attacking the Knight on F6 kind of hitting it around and now Knight to C3 and dropping back like this Knight E4 attacks the pawn on C5 Hans defends it but with his King still in the center of the board white plays Knight to F6 check which looks like a fatal knockout punch because if Pawn takes Pawn takes boom and boom and like you're gonna take and black is lost but Knight F6 is just met with King f8 and black is like I don't need to Castle stupid you can now you gotta go back right this is the exact same thing that happened this they're they're following exactly the same game as Magnus Carlson versus Hans Neiman which is really funny excuse me which is really really funny uh because that was the game that Hans beat Magnus and then proceeded to walk out and say you know chess speaks for itself and uh and and then walked away uh so this is very bold uh by uh by the Turkish Grandmasters to play into this exact same thing Hans pins his Knight and vaja plays Knight C3 clearly out of prep right like look at the time spent right 11 minutes uh and and Hans plays Knight E6 and Hunters doesn't need to Castle he doesn't need to Castle because izan's demon and he does whatever the you know he wants but also white can't really do anything because white is pinned and if white tries to kick out the bishop black will just take and you're still kind of like stuck I mean you can't really do anything and if I mean you try to it's not really accomplishing anything so uh Knight B5 so attacking the queen you cannot take because you're pinned so you just move your queen and Y comes to A3 with the intention of playing Knight C4 Queen D5 offering a trade and offering to improve the pawn structure after which black is just calmly better uh and actually that does happen we have a little bit of a dance here of Pawns and now the Queens get traded but Hans is just better why is he better good Center presence restricting White's movement potential to attack with the H Pawn and a Target in the center of the board all he had to do was just not Castle he then regroups on E6 gets this he still has the pressure still controls the center and now even has an open file and still can play H4 H3 and he can bring his Rook nobody cares about Black's King because the more pieces that you trade the less role the king plays in the game C4 Hans now plays D4 locking the center of the board completely and he has what we call a protected pass Pawn a pawn that cannot be stopped by any other pawns it can only be blockaded alright rookie 4 Rook to d8 centralizing and now a red carpet has been laid so Bishop D2 that Bishop is gonna serve as a blockading piece of the pawn so what does Hans do immediately trades the bishop immediately offers a bishop trade white plays F4 preventing that however by playing the move F4 you have now pinned yourself try not to pin yourself in chess because you can't move and that pawn is a target so not only can you not move you also have to defend yourself and if you go G3 I'm gonna go here or here so Knight to G7 is an expert maneuver back and forward full blockade now of white structure and Rook G8 and every single piece that Hans demon has is being activated Rook takes H5 is not possible because of the absolutely brutal Fork on the Rooks so Rook to H3 preventing that Rook to B8 firing firing away on the B file Black's Rooks are standing on open lines and they are powerful Rook to B6 Rook A6 is on the way and you can go here unbelievable I just spectacular peace coordination from Hans white plays E6 trying to throw a wrench in the wheels and Han says okay now I have all the perks of the position and an extra Pawn you have to play Knight C2 Rook to A6 I am attacking your weakness I'm gonna induce you to play the move A4 and now weaken the B3 pawn pawn to H4 anchoring in on the G3 Square A5 the bishop drops back Rook to C6 B4 white tries to break out it ain't good enough King to F7 and white just has absolutely nothing Brewing he tries to create a little counter play But Here Comes the other Rook the Knight plants itself on G3 and white can play rookie one but it's just a matter of time before you resign so he sacrifices his Rook but this is not a rook sacrifice that I need to yell for this is a rook sacrifice where black comes back gobbles everything and uh the Rooks are now going to come and infiltrate what a game from Hans this was just actually from start to finish just an absolutely clinical game against the 2600 Grand Master and the hapsanal played into the exact same position Hans had against Magnus like this is this is a famous game right and and you you just you you have to have something as an improvement and Hans made it look so easy I mean he put his Queen nice and center and then he just launched his Pawns and then when he when he clarified the center he just locked the center and look how beautifully I mean one Rook then the night routes to a five The Rook goes to G8 The Rook goes to B8 H4 anchoring in the Knight on the G3 Square just spectacular stuff I mean making it look effortless against really good players you thought that game was good yeah what I'm about to show you might even be nicer he played against Max valmardham who's a strong Dutch Grandmaster uh and Max went for a king's Indian defense the king's Indian defense has gotten really out of fashion at the highest level of Chess it used to have like a massive massive massive score for black and it was played by Kasparov and rajabov and dingly ren in fact uh world champion contender in 2023 but nobody really plays it anymore uh at like 2650 plus level uh and the reason okay that's like a strong statement but very few people play it uh because white gets a comfortable advantage in many lines and Hans plays H3 Bishop E3 which is actually something that I myself have played and the point is that white just gets this and just wants to play G4 and put the Knight on G3 and just start an attack just start an attack just put the Knight on G3 put the pawn on G4 H4 H5 Etc uh Max tries to fight back in the center with C6 Hans plays Knight F3 black plays Knight A6 and 98 so trying to play the move F5 and also rotate the Knight this way now Hans here takes on C6 and plays this very very nice idea C5 he's able to play this because he would not have been able to play this let's say like here I mean he could try but none of this works because that's defended by The Rook but when you play 98 white has this moment here to do this and then play C5 and he's able to do this because of this pin and The Rook is no longer defending the queen so for this moment and this moment only he is able to play this move now probably here Max needed to do something like this and then slowly recapture this Pawn instead of that Max tries to Fight Fire with Fire with the move F5 he spends 20 minutes on the Move F5 and Hans plays Pawn takes D6 which was his idea Knight takes D6 gives a check and put this puts his Rook on the center line Hans is better here he's better because black is really stuck black has this little peace Cube but he's really stuck and he's really struggling to make forward progress now the queen goes to E7 attacks tonight you'll notice that Black's Queen side is kind of in Ruins kind of in Ruins black really prefers a close center with some attacking chances Queen B7 defense castles F4 and the bishop draws back to D2 and again white is better why is white better better pieces all right better pieces and Black's piece is kind of stuck and the structure is kind of Frozen rookie 8 played Queen C4 pins the Knight on F7 and Hans begins kind of mobilizing on the queen side and here it goes from bad to worse as Max plays Bishop E6 attacking the queen Hans drops back offering up the pawn on A2 and both players go down a rabbit hole Bishop takes A2 is what Max plays and they both calculate the same line but one calculates better you see Bishop takes A2 has a very clear plan of Bishop B3 or just in general coming out now obviously both players calculate the move Knight C5 here which attacks the queen and threatens to play the move B3 trapping in the bishop however there's Queen B6 and you cannot just rush with the move B3 because I will remove the defender of that pawn so Knight C5 Queen B6 Rook A1 attacking the bishop and Max plays Knight E6 it's the night you can't take because I'll take this you can't take because I'll Escape so Hans plays B4 and the bishop is trapped it cannot Escape Knight takes C5 bc5 hits the queen and the bishop is still hanging someone's gotta account for it Bishop to B3 hits the queen back Queen can't be taken so Queen C3 the queen is hanging the only way the queen can defend the bishop is by staying on the B file and Rook to B1 Rook to B8 Bishop C4 and that's it black resigned now you might think it's not the end of the world to lose a bishop at this level it is why because after I take the bishop I will have lifelong pressure on that and I mean I can just even very simply do this and at this level of Chess having a full extra night is more than enough to win a game uh Hans plays like into a king's Indian at the exact right moment bust the center very nice idea C5 utilizing that weakened Queen his opponent locks the center with F4 but that's not good enough white has too much peace activity and he gets and black gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar a beautiful four sequence of moves traps the bishop and Bishop C4 and this was one of uh several wins I think Hans beat Four Strong Grand Masters uh in Menorca and he tied for first place he didn't win first place because of like tie breaks and whatever uh bahan's Demon's back Hans Lehman is back and he's looking sharp and he's playing well uh and uh I don't know what his next tournament is but in this one he got seven points out of nine 2705 performance rating with a rating of 2706 so looking sharp and uh looking forward to his next event he can't say too much but he does his talking on the chessboard because as we all know just speaks for itself and uh in several of these games it really did and Hans only lost one game in this event uh and it was to uh V pranav who's a very quickly Rising uh young Indian player so I look forward to seeing his next tournament and if you don't know the Hans and Magnus thing you got to go down that rabbit hole so check that out and uh do me a favor and get out of here
