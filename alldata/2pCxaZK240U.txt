ladies and gentlemen I've just defeated the greatest chess player of all time Magnus Carlson in a one-on-one game and in this video I'm going to share this game with you I still can't believe I'm uttering those words my hands are still a bit shaky my heart rate is elevated to an unhealthy level this whole game I was in full-on panic mode but I managed to keep myself composed and play a breathtaking game of chess I I might frame this game somewhere if I can uh I was laying in bed last night and I was on my Anonymous account I have an anonymous account I like to play on translate come let's be playing it gives me a little privacy and I was playing in the three minute pool and I got Magnus he didn't know it was me I knew it was him the when I tell you the heart rate skyrocketed to 150 that would not even be an over exaggeration here's the game I started off with E4 all right I uh I'm a principled man I've been playing a lot of E4 in my online games and Magnus played the most confrontational move which is the Sicilian Defense now I know a lot of things against the Sicilian A3 B3 Knights I mean the allop in the Smith Mora uh of course the Gambit I decided to play Knight F3 uh and Magnus went E6 and now here I decided all right look I I think that I don't want to play into the goats uh timonov or Paulson Khan so I'm gonna go for a sideline variation so I'm gonna play Knight C3 normally if you start with the second move Knight to F3 You're Gonna Play Pawn to D4 and after CD4 Knight D4 it's going to be an open Sicilian and Magnus rather than going straight on for a Timon of with Knight C6 E6 this is just a pure Timon of Sicilian after Queen C7 Magnus plays A6 so A6 preserves the option of going like this and now you'll notice that instead of a knight on C6 there's a pawn here and this is known as the Khan variation so soon as the Paulson con variation where black plays E6 A6 great Sicilian Defense for intermediate players by the way but that was not my intention the only reason I played this way is to go here and completely take Magnus out of you know any main lines I'm playing a guy five-time World Champ multiple time rapid and Blitz World Champ and give it a few years we'll go down as the goat I'm like I gotta play a little bit weak sauce all right I'm not gonna challenge him in any open Sicilians or anything like that and Magnus plays B5 all right very confrontational approach on the queen side he's looking for B4 looking for Bishop B7 I don't really need to react because it's not like my knight is getting trapped so I just play Bishop G2 and now before he has an opportunity to play B4 I play D4 alright now B4 is a little bit too dangerous so he trades and now it's like we've played an open Sicilian but I've put my Bishop here and I'm ready to Castle now I I don't know a whole lot of theory but I know that I have you know a bit more at least I don't know a lot of theory here but I know that I've got like a healthy lead in development and life is good um now I thought all right Magnus will go here D6 Bishop E7 no he he attacks me right away he doesn't know it's me uh but he attacks me right away uh and that's gonna dislodge my night now traditionally speaking you would think that you want to go back to E2 right and then reroute because if you go to A4 you're not coming off the edge of the board but I actually knew a little a little trick in this line uh which I uh which I've seen um get very trendy recently and it's the fact that after black attacks your Pawn in the center and you obviously can't push it you actually don't need to defend this Pawn you can play Queen E2 you can play Queen D3 but you don't even need to guard this Pawn you can just Castle why can you do this why can you sacrifice a pawn in the center of the board with like a knight on the edge well the thing is that black is not developed enough black will have to at least trade something if they take this pawn and you've got a king in the center at least two moves away from castling because the bishop has to move in so does the Knight so if you think about the fact that like if black if if black has to take the pawn here black is gonna have to hang on like on a roller coaster have you know if you've ever been on a roller coaster some people who just go like this and yell and are excited no I'm holding on for dear life all right I'm screaming too um now the the problem for black is they're in too deep if black plays a move like Bishop E7 uh now I actually can play E5 because after this I have this hitting two Bishops and if you take I take this and then I'm gonna take the bishop and I'm completely winning um so obviously after Castle's Magnus took on e4 uh now takes takes and then this is where I detonated uh my little trap so I knew a little bit about this opening and I knew that there was one trap in this position so this position has been reached about 40 50 times at Master Level and after rookie one attacking the Knight D5 C4 trying to dislodge the pawn BC and then white recapturing on C3 with the Knight or the pawn white is scoring very well because Black's King is very very vulnerable so what people started to do after rookie one is they started to just move the Knight they don't play they don't they don't play D5 they just move the Knight and and rookie once kind of been neutralized by just retreating the Knight which is why instead of rookie one in this position white has started to play C4 first with an absolutely fascinating idea now if you voluntarily Retreat your night out of the position you've just given white an extra move basically so white will play Queen F3 Bishop F4 like white will bring all these pieces and you've just given white an extra turn but if you play song now I play rookie one you see what I'm talking about so now after rookie one attacking the Knight after D5 it's the exact same position and if you play Knight C5 while this is different because you've actually traded off your Pawn here and I'll come back your knight is offside so I I knew this little trick and I was going to play it against Magnus uh and I I was gonna hope for the best all right and hope for the best I did uh because he immediately made a mistake like right away he immediately made a mistake now unfortunately I didn't punish his mistake as you can see the evaluation goes back well this is I mean this is what happens right like you you get a good position against a very good player Queen F3 right hits this and this but uh Queen F3 I thought he just guards Queen G4 I thought well I could take the pawn but uh so I played I played you know I played what I thought I was supposed to play but what I because like I said you're supposed to play rookie one but I should have adapted to the situation here and realized you know I don't have to play rookie one I can just play Queen F3 or queen G4 um so I played rookie one now he played F5 and I was like look if I let Magnus just get a couple of like easy turns here he's just gonna Castle right like what does black want this is the way you need to play chess actively you got to think about what does your opponent want and uh even though it's a Blitz game I know I play F3 which you can see the computer doesn't really like and then I played Bishop G5 computer gives it an inaccuracy but the computer can piss off my idea was to prevent magnets from castling say how are you preventing Magnus from castling well if Magnus castled in this position at the end of the day I am going to attack his King and his Rook what how with what with my queen but how this is blocked and that's in the way yeah like this Knight F5 and if he takes before I go here I remove the guard from that square and I'm gonna be a material I'm gonna be winning now I played this little trick and I thought all right Magnus is gonna play here H6 and then in this position uh he started disrespecting me for lack of a better word um you know he thought he saw it was like three four hundred points higher rated than Blitz he's like 3 200 Blitz I'm like 2 800 you know I'm not like the world's worst Blitz player but you know so here Magnus played King F7 and I was like you know it's Magnus so of course I'm like oh my god king F7 what a move because very simple he just wants to play he's gonna do what what they call castling by hand he's gonna manually walk the king to the corner I thought well you know I don't really know what I'm you know I thought I can sacrifice on E6 to not let that happen so I played Queen E2 I was like I'm gonna play 96 and I was expecting rookie eight and then if you know if this I don't know I thought maybe I could develop an attack as you can see the computer just thinks I'm I'm not getting a whole lot I mean it thinks that the king is gonna just go to safety so I played Queenie 2 but what what came next was unbelievably surprising okay after playing King F7 I thought rookie ate King Jade castling by hand in this position Magnus played King to G6 now you see stockfish gives it a double X like first on Ironically in the middle of a game Magnus just walked his King out to G6 almost completely unprompted and I and I I lost my mind here okay I was like uh what I thought about taking I thought about defending my Bishop and then here I played the move G4 now the fascinating thing about G4 okay is that it it's a brilliant move it's actually the top computer move in the position I didn't realize my Bishop could be taken I accidentally played a brilliant move I was thinking he's gonna take it I'm gonna you know get to his King I literally forgot he can play this I I don't have the evalon during the game I don't know it's plus three okay I don't know I thought oh my God what am I doing I just hung a bishop but I thought all right you know what like his last three moves Were King F7 King G6 but maybe I could do something with this King like maybe it's not the end of the road all right I hung up the hunger Bishop his King's open what do I do time to open up his King all right I'm gonna try to get in here now he can't take back because first of all his King looks really weak second of all I can get my Bishop back all right so I thought Okay g takes up five he can't take I've got this I've got this I've got all these different checks King H1 all right so he goes King H6 which is you can see the computer really doesn't like um and I thought okay I can give him a check I can give him a check I can bring my queen over what if I just keep taking though this move enables two things right and you can see the disrespect here like there's a reason it's plus 4.4 it's because out of nowhere black literally made four king moves the lesson here is don't make four king moves in the middle of a game that's just probably not going to but I didn't know that you know I'm playing that I'm panicking all right so I go here and my intention is to play Knight F5 now if he takes on E6 that opens up this uh but after 96 he's in severe trouble his Queen is hanging he cannot give me any checks and uh the attack on the king is going to be devastating and the problem is this bishop hangs in all the lines so I get this he's gonna get mated um so I played fe6 he went Queen A5 and now this move I actually did this was not a blunder of a piece whereas last time I just forgot my Bishop could be taken here I saw this was hanging but the most important thing here is to not let the queen come here and this move is like a naval blockade on the position C5 now of course when I played it I didn't know I was gonna get the 2x clams two brilliant moves all right I'm playing the game of my life here I don't know what the heck is going on I don't know what's possessing me at this 2AM you know game on my iPhone I disconnect the queen from the defense of the king queen E5 Queen E3 Knight F5 all enabled you can take my knight but that's not where the queen wants to go because I'm gonna get my Bishop back at least with Knight E7 and uh then your king is left you know to battle my my queen and my Rook while the queen is just you know on vacation enjoying a pina colada so C5 and I thought oh my God like my heart is I'm like oh my God don't mess this up don't mess this up don't mess this up I mean it's gonna be a YouTube video regardless if you win or lose but don't mess this up Knight C6 Knight F5 check King G5 back everything looks dangerous and then here I realized oh my God I have H4 check I have H4 check and the thing is he's not going to G6 because if this this is mate this is just mate I'm like oh my God oh my God my Rook is guarding I can't believe this is happening King to G5 H4 check King takes F5 Queen D3 check like okay I was expecting this and I was like oh my God his King's gonna Escape it I'm not gonna be able to mate him but maybe I can suck my Rook maybe I can sack my Rook or something nuts maybe I have a mate right so I'm thinking oh my God I'm gonna play rookie for like this is the way we're gonna win this game but he plays Knight E4 he sacrifices his Knight and he tries to run backwards and I play check King F6 and now I just don't let his King Escape back I play Queen F4 check King G6 and here the engine finds a force Checkmate in 13 after H5 but I played King H1 and a little bit of my advantage is gone but Rook G1 sliding over is on the way and if he plays H6 trying to escape out to H7 which was really the entire idea of this whole maneuver Rook G1 and if he goes here I sack my rook and I was like oh my God this Pawn is the hero this Pawn is the hero Rook G1 check Bishop G5 now here there is still a way to blunder you can blunder hgag discovered check and you lose but Bishop G5 and I sacrificed The Rook my third brilliant move I only thought I had two of them but three HG Queen G5 King H7 check here check here Rook G1 and no matter what he does his Queen and his Knight cannot prevent Queen G7 and if one of his Rooks tries to prevent Queen G7 Queen G6 Queen H5 are mate and that's why after 31 Rook G1 Magnus resigned and I damn near threw up I damn near so I was like no way oh my God there is hope for me in my chess career oh oh my now folks before we sign off this video um I don't even know what to say I mean for I I might not I might not ever I might not ever play I can't even speak I might not ever play a chess game ever again um it doesn't get any better than this uh uh I I want to say two things before I I sign off here um number one uh if you're lucky enough to be watching this video in the first three days that it comes out um we're having a 50 off course to sale on my website and after watching me beat Magnus you know might want to and um the second thing I want to say is like what's really really crazy about this is the same day that I played Magnus there was a game played in the Reykjavik open in Iceland between women's Grand Master Dina billing and uh Gregor gayevsky who's a Polish Grandmaster and I'm not sure if you can tell the the similarities here but position looks very very very similar to ours um and it was uh just a fascinating breathtaking attacking display um by uh by both parties so yeah chess is a fascinating game it's a fascinating game for sure now get out of here
