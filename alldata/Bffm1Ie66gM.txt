this is uh quintessentially British we have tea and biscuits and we are talking PDF yes it's the 30th anniversary of the release of PDF I knew it was going to be a success of sorts but I did not foresee how widely it is now taken up but I must add to that I also underestimated how long it would take people to Twig what it was for so that was an extra source of tension you know so very well David you've been telling us to go with PDF it's the future well the future's taking an awful long time coming I'm pleased I was right because I am not a futurologist i generally shy away from making definitive statements that what we'll catch on and what won't but this one I was convinced about because I knew it was the future but I just didn't quite get right the Gap that there was uh between it being released and it being adopted and largely because even people in the trade didn't fully understand what it was doing and the leave origin extra flexibility it would give them in what they did I think I've talked Elsewhere on PDF what is it for even people in the trade could sort of well I do everything with liner type what's wrong with that and I would say well suppose you could make your pages of stuff even better if they could insert material prepared on kit that wasn't from your favorite Setter but was adhering to this new standard called PDF and in certain with certain rules you could insert bits of PDF Here There and Everywhere and they said what by subverting all I said not necessarily by subverting all the software you're using but just by saying I can do an insert here using this add-on to the plugin and it's completely self-contained but I can put bits and pieces Here There and Everywhere it gave potentially massive new flexibility I think what I didn't realize at the time was that because in the npdf was a success it really was instrumental in changing my career Direction uh I had I and my Merry gang of colleagues got into this because we were computer scientists we weren't always I was not thinking at the time of wouldn't it be nice to do those really smart sharp documents that Bell Labs can do and that even when you photograph them and put them through a photocopier from the release material that's about this thick when it comes to the post even if you vote to copy this again it still looked good and it looked better than anything we'd got would it ever be a situation where quality of that potential became available to Mere how should we say enthusiasts from the wrong side of the Atlantic PDF came out in 93. that's correct but is that you've got involved earlier didn't you yes I did um even before I knew about PDF just as part of reading the Unix documentation because we'd bought Unix about three or four years before even got a little PDP 1134 to get herself started we were just a computer science group within a bigger maths grouping it was only a little machine but it was ours and it was wonderful and we could play with it so it became a strange feeling to be the proud owner of some Machinery which basically only made sense that that money and uh with that degree of expenditure due to the fact that in an incredible display of bounty to us all good old Bell labs and the highly talented people there invented Unix as an operating system and then gave it away because they couldn't be seen to be making money and using these obscene quantities of income from the stream of stuff they shouldn't be doing anywhere and then using it to try and put us out of business by undercutting us on everything we did it wasn't true but you could see how Corporate sensitivities were aroused by companies that were under restrained and Bell Labs was told you will not convert yourself into a computer company you will stay hands off you will help universities if you help other companies boy we're going to draw up such a tight thing because we have got the entire U.S government on our necks if we are saying as breaking the antitrust rules so it's all worked out extremely well for higher education establishments I could see from the documentation that came with the Unix that the very lowest level of output device they had was essentially what will be given from a daisy wheel printer Laser Printers were in the process of being invented by Hewlett-Packard and by Xerox Park and others but they were not widely available yet so if you wanted a slightly lower quality but good version you had to change Technologies completely because by this stage your genuine typesetter end of things was beginning the path towards crawling towards Laser Printers at 6 or 1200 DPI but that was about the best you could get and the problem was that if you went for these other Technologies which were basically like tele types typewriter fonts and so on then you ended up with the your output looking fairly neat but not the same as it would have looked if only I could have afforded to send it off to a proper type Setter like an autologic apps five or a linatronic 202 and this machine UK design is called the linotronic 202 this was the one step so if you want a few anecdotes there about how I change my field simply because of an unlocked for gift of a proper type Setter that really could do 972 dots per inch and you didn't mind the smell of bromo developer and fixer there you go because I didn't have to wait that long I could see coming off the laser print Mac laser printer in the early 80s here it was on Plain paper no chemical processing took about a minute to image each page but this was clearly the future it would soon speed up the chemicals will be like a memory from yesterday I remember growing up and people talking about this mythical paperless office right it was all about oh we won't be printing things out everything will be on the screens and of course we kind of were a lot closer to that these days aren't we but was that in thought when things like PDF and PostScript were coming out oh there was a lot of debate about why don't we leave it's all electronic and just post the um script of the paper in front well they're all in the future David have a little terminal on their desk in the exam room and I thought oh no they won't but this was the idea it'll all be electronic paper will be sold like yesterday people would be baffled by what it was no I didn't see this I thought it would be an incredible adjunct to have both electronic and paper kept alongside each other and I think this is true even now as you see in my legacy box here I do try to keep hard copy archive versions of things that are really important as well as locking the actual document and the software somewhere safe in the file system of my Linux machine which is over in that direction your type setting exams you've changed your field and you're now working in document engineer is that fair that's right how do you get from there to kind of PDF and Beyond well PDF was a common factor between the two I mean the more if you like important test was whether that we could produce and distribute a serious Journal just a little demonstration piece and it would but at the same time as a as a what's a word on look for side effect we had also got something which was my point of view was perfectly good low qual lower quality but for exam papers you were killing two birds with one stone and I thought well you know this is absolutely great it's just what we need for all of the unwashed who can't tell the difference will get a blurry but okay thing off the Macintosh laser printer everything else if people still cared and could still tell the difference could it be sent to a bromide typesetter but I did forecast it increasingly people wouldn't be bothered and I could see coming up on the rails but never quite quite quick enough for me to head off trouble at the pass all the improvements in laser printer quality I mean you're talking now about three thousand or two thousand dots per inch that's I think minimum but in those days it was wow it's now possible to get a 600 DPI laser printer you know if people say well how did you know you were on the right track Dave and this time it will go your way well I thought well just out of the blue because they'd heard about what I was doing on the Grapevine Lord knows how Adobe UK found out what we were doing but there again by that time we'd taken on John Wiley's for the actual experiment and it was not Beyond you know not Beyond possible that some backlink somewhere had joined the two together because I did not solicit the letter from John Warnock and Chuckles they sent it to me out of the blue you know if you're not too busy on this particular day would you just like to come down and I said well I'd like to come down but I'll bring the um John Wiley UK technical director Mark bide I'll bring him down with me because I know that he will want to hear what your plans are one has to remember that on the other side of the fence there were Technologies being developed alongside these that were relevant but needed bridging points to show people where you could jump Paradigm as they were because the big problem was there was a world of appearance and super duper PDF and there was a world of structure even if it's only para or P from XML SML everybody wanted superb quality of appearance to be digable outable of all this stuff they also wanted full capability to use the tags as kind of semantic marker what is the meaning of this and if you're not careful you end up with a single source file with about 27 different interpretations whether it's purely structure partly structure trying to second guess what PDF's gonna do whatever the two sides are still not reconciled not surprising because there was a big semantic gap between the two it's all very well to structure it but that magic thing about how does that known as tree structure translate into something visually meaningful and helpful is another big problem in its own right everybody your architecture or whoever it will doesn't matter how technical this stuff is if it's anything graphic e vectors shadowed photographs whatever whatever this technology is powerful enough to do it and all it requires is the people who have adopted this technology not to try and Corner the market and make it their own because they won't succeed the whole reason for Adobe being prepared to give up some control to ISO was that in a sense they could moderate and police the way it developed and it wouldn't just be seen as an adobe benefit March and I think they got that right because what they got was the status of being the undoubted experts behind postgroups and PDF and uh my colleague Matthew as I say is on the iso Committee in Geneva for quite a few years and was regularly sent back to the USA um saying will you ask the designer of PostScript what on Earth he was thinking about and be able to come back and say that is not a feature it's a bug and in the course of testing out all our worst cases to try and keep you ISO happy we will no doubt run through lots lots more of these so it's sort of a robustness now what's happened is the app has gone in cropped the image down to a much smaller one which takes up less space in memory so like kind of engineering type things this one is getting creating removing providing criticizing so like for some reason these types of words
