what's up guys today we're going to be looking at reviews on Amazon and yes my face is really red I don't know if you can tell this lighting but I was in the Sun too much and now it's really red and most you're gonna come and feast your face looks like a tomato I know I understand no need to flip out I'm not gonna die and yeah now make sure you like the video because everyone who likes this video will get the first product we talk about for free I'm not even joking every single person who likes this video will receive the first product we talked about I'm dead serious I would not lie to you guys the first product we're going to be looking at is called the gift of nothing basically you pay six and a half dollars for essentially nothing and we're going to look at the reviews to my dismay I discovered air molecules within my nothing very dissatisfied it's everything I've always wanted I bought this and it turned out to be a piece of crap what a waste of ten dollars for nothing wait if it was a piece of crap why did you rate it five stars that doesn't anyways the next product is a book about how to avoid huge ships now you're probably thinking this book sounds pointless why would anyone buy it but to be fair it is extremely cheap it is only 230 dollars I followed the directions but utterly kept finding huge ships everywhere the ocean the pond my toilet this book has poor directions to informative read this book before going on vacation and I couldn't find my cruise liner in the port vacation ruined wino Kindle edition given that there's a huge ship bearing down on me right now I'm extremely disappointed that I cannot get this avoid cover art I was going to buy this book but following the titles advice means avoiding the huge ship on the cover so I guess it's a successful book since I avoided this one warning the title is misleading this book is for avoiding huge ships I repeat huge ships not boats I got hit by three of those this morning four out of five stars next up we're going to read some reviews about this Asian sticker and it alright I mean it's not really smiling though I put this above my bed a month ago and I'm still not good at math the next reviews were to be looking at is for a UFO detector which costs $90 once star is too much for this product I don't know if this is a scam or if mine was broken but it doesn't work and I'm still getting abducted by UFOs on a regular basis one star didn't detect my alien wife this thing is a scam every time I fooled my UFO around back this thing would not go off maybe I need a new spaceship or my money back okay so there's this product on Amazon called area where men's gradient puzzle and as you can see in the title it says men's puzzle and is 2016 so lots of women are getting triggered why is this a men's puzzle why can't women do it and there's this one review that is hilarious not made for women well I'm sure this puzzle is great for others I made a great mistake while purchasing it I noticed that this puzzle was made specifically for men I thought that I could solve it but I being just a woman and therefore we can done intelligent found it so difficult that I began to stress cooking I made nearly 42 sandwiches in under an hour well I'm sure this puzzle is great is just not made for women I hope that any other women considering this product learn from my experience unfortunately most of us can't read so this probably won't make any difference dang okay so I was looking for a gaming mouse pad and this isn't a review but on Amazon you're allowed to leave questions ask questions about products and on this gaming mouse pad someone left a question asking will this work for a Mac some someone literally asked someone asked that quite a stat question no I don't want to live in this world bless the smiling Asian boy when I come home from a hard day of work here they're smelling down on me from my wall no matter what mood I'm in you looked at me with those big brown eyes and you understand giving me the motivation to go on smiling Asian teenage boy you empower me to use kind words in action I cannot envision my life without you you have brought joy and pleasure into my life I picture you all the time with me with us gazing into each other's eyes I owe my life to you smiling Asian teenage boy and with this I say thank you I feel the same way
