I've got something I want to show you meet my big pink 10in ohy Netbook from AliExpress why you ask if you sort all the new Windows laptops in existence from low to high the top result will be this the laptop 10.1 in Windows 10 notebook computer full HD Netbook mini gaming Mass memory 3 gig plus 32 gig cheap PC laptops but what it lacks in having a brand name or a name at all it sure as heck makes up for with being P so what happens when you buy the absolute cheapest laptop we are about to find out like we're about to find out about our sponsor ug green do you need some on the-go juice the ugreen 145 wat power bank is equipped with PD 3.0 QC 3.0 and a massive 25,000 mAh battery check it out at the link below see here's the thing as the machine gets cheaper the computer gets lighter and the screen gets heavier to the point where the balance is uh not great let's take a look at the manual laptops I feel like this is one of those inspirational posters what I do get is a surprisingly thorough quickart guide though things do fall apart a little when we look closer touchpad it's convenient for you to operate the computer wow it says I can charge over either the barrel Jack or the type-c interface huh I wasn't expecting that I think I figured it out there's two completely different laptops in here with two completely different Legends for what everything is on them oh this one's actually right oh I was looking at the wrong one so the touchpad is not convenient to operate the computer it's operating laptop easily wow okay let's see if there's anything else in here more packing foam and wow they included a mouse o imagine looking at Apple's Mouse and thinking right there that's the ergonomic design I want this was a very cheap laptop and it never mentioned once that it came with a mouse that is a huge bonus okay look at that trackpad that's probably massive yeah this is probably a pretty big Improvement and to their credit it doesn't charge from the bottom the only other thing in the box is our power adapter which totally makes sense except also doesn't because the AliExpress listing shows and mentions micro USB for power In fairness though I think I'd much rather have a barrel plug micro USB was not made for this not going to hold that against it what I will hold against it is its truly archaic screen to body ratio I don't think I've seen bezels this big for funsies we calculated it and it's 59.6% wow with that said the build quality of it I mean it's no aluminum unibody or anything but it's far from the worst I've ever seen for context here's an LG gam a machine that costs an order of magnitude more and it's better but and bigger but you know Things Fall Apart a little when we get to IO though starts good USB 3 I mean that's not to be taken for granted on a machine like this a headset Jack micro SD slot for expansion uh actually that's an earphone hole sorry this is an ear phone hole yes I'm sorry okay did I get anything else wrong actually that's trans Flash not micro SD okay that shouldn't matter trans flash is just an outdated term for micro SD really it's is it not the same okay hold on a second so we've got a new highspeed high-capacity micro SD there's no way I think it's just an outdated terminology this is going to work wow did we have Brandon from the lab check this display yes it's really slow right my micro SD card totally works look at this look at these icons popping in that's nuts what icon pack is that then over on the other side obviously we've got our power input USB 3 again and then it said it had HDMI but this is mini HDMI which is infinitely worse it is an awful awful connector now Alex sent me some notes on the keyboard saying and I quote it is surprisingly good okay I um hm it's not the greatest thing in the world but the layout is what you would expect the keys have a surprisingly long travel and as long as you don't mind the miniature key caps it's not terrible I'm getting kind of a designed for kids Vibe yeah which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as it works okay that seems like the perfect target audience for the cheapest laptop in the world with that said it has to work okay um and the trackpad is not as good the size honestly I don't even mind that much given how small the display is it's not like I have trouble moving around on it but the click I think it could best be described as crunchy here listen to this if you press too hard on the left click the right click activates as well of course who needs a quality trackpad when you've got a Bonus included Mouse and according to my notes it is better than I expect yeah I'm a little skeptical here m is great great okay let's have a look here 125 HZ pulling rate 25 milliseconds of latency okay that's about expected adjustable DPI all the way from 400 to 1600 and oh is that what this button does yeah it has a okay it has a DPI button Antoine measured this yes 03 and 38 for sensor accuracy and precision respectively that's actually a really strong result yeah that's quite good this thing absolutely annihilates the Tommy hillfigure gaming mouse we looked at a little while ago and some glorious mice before they updated the firmware sorry SP I actually don't know what spin out is you know when you like are in csgo or whatever and you flick the mouse and instead of it tracking it just like poops itself and your character just goes like oh sure to be clear we're not saying you should replace your gaming mouse with this thing sensor acceleration and spin out are both problems at high speeds like you might encounter in gaming in fact you can even see that instead of it moving straight across in a line sometimes there are outliers way above or below we're just saying it's a lot better than we expected The Click feel is also awful here can you even hear it ironically the DPI select button has by far the best tactile feel still opening still opening how are they going to spy on me if the camera app can't even open wow that's beautiful I can't tell how much of that is the bad camera and how much of that is the bad pixel response time of the display wow I have aged terribly not the best webcam I've ever seen you know people are always talking about how like all the bearded white dudes here look similar and I never saw it until I looked at an image in this webcam y can't tell the difference why don't we talk performance now for CPU there might be two options what do you mean two options well the specs have two different ones either a Celeron or an atom both from about 2016 which one do you want what do you mean which one do I want it's going to be whatever it is in here okay I'm checking task manager and it looks like we got the ceron n3350 that is a dual core processor with a base speed of 1.1 gigz wow that explains why it's been kind of slow hold on a second though things are about to get worse what the heck is 2.8 gigs of memory how do you put 2.8 gigs of memory in a computer Alex do you have an explanation for this also how high is this chip supposed to Turbo because I don't think it does at all oh wait oh no it does there you go okay she'll turbo to 2 GHz that's one of the things that I have in my notes it's like Heisenberg's uncertainty cuz you can never really measure the laptop because things like task manager and Hardware info use so much CPU I don't know what's worse the fact that dragging a task manager window spikes the CPU usage to 60% or the fact that it isn't even trying to render that window preview okay okay I did that intentionally cuz it does speed it up a lot oh okay yeah oh okay what the hell I think I figured out the memory thing it's a one gig stick and a 2 gig stick two of three slots are populated also this is DDR3 memory and here's another thing why is dis zero the C Drive listed as an SD card I don't know that but it is emmc so it is pretty bad although not SD card bad okay oh man this thing sucks given the cost can we really expect that much I mean this is a $24 CPU I don't know you can at least expect Updates this thing will be getting them until September 30th of this year after that it's EOL oh but does a CPU need service updates well like security updates are nice oh yeah especially with all the stuff that's been happen okay we have other ideas for stress tests though you suggested opening a YouTube video yes this is one of the strongest Arguments for ad block that I think I've ever seen like you got to be careful about the kinds of pages you load cuz anything images or autoplay video they are going to grind your entire computer to a halt are forums light enough how about LTT store.com oh my goodness look at this delay look I I have I have pressed enter already what oh okay I didn't do anything I'm afraid Shoppers use the laptop Netbook whatever are going to have a hard time hey look at that you can sign up for a notification for when the no to Edition LTT screwdriver is coming any who I got distracted what I'm supposed to be doing is opening up a YouTube video how about crab Rave 10 hours perfect what could be better we should have task manager task manager is probably sucking back 30% of the CPU Alex why you got to Massacre my boy way like that o how are the speakers I bet they're functional that's as loud as they get huh I feel like I've had smart watches with better speakers than that I want to hear the drop first there's no base there's barely mids okay can we do 720p yes yes we can barely that CPU is turboing like its life depends on it but will we reach 1080p Nirvana I think it's dropping frames wow that took a long time to full screen what's the HL button Windows apparently speakers are pretty awful you can hear them shaking it too yeah that's morocca sound I don't think you can listen to these at higher than about 60% without Distortion and at 60% I can barely hear it I really don't think it's dropping frames Alex it looks like it's figured it out it's doing 1080p playback damn and In fairness to it this display is a lot better than the TN piece of crap that you would have found on a machine like this even 3 to 5 years ago yeah it is IPS it's not bright but the viewing angles are actually usable uh wait where do you adjust the brightness I haven't actually tried that on the website it claims that it is full HD AKA 1080p 100 HZ and 16x9 mhm how many of those do you think are true this doesn't seem to be 16 by9 NOP looks like it might be 1080p no oh well it's definitely not 100 HZ what is the resolution is it like 1 16600 by 900 or something 1280 by 800 really oh it looks all right yeah it's not that bad I guess it's not that big yeah 10 in that makes a really big difference and I figured out the brightness you just have to do it in windows with the slider something that I noticed well actually our camera operator noticed is that there's a lot of flicker though in the display and it changes depending on the brightness which means that they're using pwm control for brightness rather than DC control that is archaic and causes Flicker and can lead to more eye fatigue the actual Labs results for theplay are not great the peak brightness is 244 nits which they describe as piss poor it's very blue 10,000k white balance and 79% srgb which means particularly your Reds are going to be very washed out but with that said could my kids use this to watch Daniel Tiger yes yeah it's fine absolutely in fact it's probably better than whatever was on a premium laptop 10 years ago or at least like $1,000 laptop this is much better we haven't gotten away from the pixel response time issue though and in fact I think that that's probably why you thought it was dropping frames because anything in motion has so much blur it looks like there's motion blur added to it yeah it's not great I love this in the notes Alex writes if the webcam isn't an absolute potato I'll eat my shoe we already looked at it it's more potato than I think either of us could have possibly imagined now with all of that said a slow computer is still a flipping computer it runs at 2 GHz and we had the idea of well hey maybe playing some basic games on it like Hollow night I'm just waiting for that to launch one moment please it won't it's not oh steam's just not going oh wow read the notes oh Hollow KN wanted 3 hours to download because of the CPU being too slow to un unpack the files oh I see it's actually just incapable this is remarkable it's at 100% CPU usage steam is sucking back 40% of the CPU just to not download anything realistically then classic flash games are probably the most you can expect from this thing sadly those are no longer on the internet but with the power of flasho infinity you can still access them if you have an internet connection I did not know about this but I am pretty excited to try this let's go start flash point uhoh oh Visual Studio runtime not found install now this may take a few minutes oh that might take a while I'm doing it I'm going to left then right click then left click again has not even indicated it's doing anything yet this has been a legitimate problem while testing just simply downloading things takes so long that it's difficult it's not because it has a really you know awful Wi-Fi chipset driver or something like that that sucks back all the CPU is it no I plugged it in like hardwired it in didn't make a difference it has a AC Wi-Fi though Wi-Fi 4 modern no AC isn't that Wi-Fi 5 is it I think so that's better than advertised actually really yeah yeah that's what I thought okay so it has a decent Wi-Fi thing maybe I mean for all the good it does this yeah all right flasho Infinity is launched here we go this is it I love this game no no it got pulled down off new grounds at some point or addicting games.com that's one that's the one and then I never found it again it's back oh I'm so excited to play oh I was like really addicted to this game Tim was talking about how much he loves flasho and infinity cuz all the games are just here they've been saved that is so cool I'm going to play for haror man I haven't seen this loading screen in Forever wow the last time I played this game was probably on an Athlon XP I don't remember it taking this long to load I don't know standards were different back then like you boot up something and then just like go and get a water Don't Mind If I Do LTT store.com oh whoa whoa whoa whoa you did it waa it's running really fast okay the speed that it's running at is super inconsistent which is making this really hard to play uh my fuel is low I don't remember anything about fuel it turns out you control the speed of the plane I don't remember the plane going that fast though I'm pretty sure that's not a thing oh my God I can't even tell which ships are Japanese and which ones are American because the display blur is so bad I can can barely tell what flag I'm looking at wait yes okay I'm apparently Japanese okay all right I sank a ship damn it but hey at least it has really good battery life right actually that's not bad almost 5 hours of video playback and over 2 hours of stress test yeah especially from a 19w hour battery this thing's efficient that's a very small battery which means I guess it actually doesn't take that long to charge then even though it only has a 24 WT charger yeah not bad oh my God these screws are all different I wasn't really paying close attention I don't I don't know where they go I think it's like this yeah we've got three different kinds of screws out of the first four I've taken out you know for sure too if you put the long one in the wrong hole it's going straight through that keyboard wait did I say three different screws out of the first four because I meant four different screws that's the first four screws they are all different I'm starting to wonder if this is even intentional it could just be super loose Manufacturing tolerances in the screws does this battery even have all the necessary warnings and like safety certification information on it no also I think it's larger than expected 3,000 Milah hours what's that in wat hours uh 7.6 volts that's 22.8 that's higher than thought Yeah by about 10% not bad not bad considering how little is under it the keyboard Flex was less than I expected yeah there's literally not no way that's an m.2 slot what you could put an m.2 SSD in here that's not an m.2 that is an m.2 it's labeled SSD smart guy what there's nowhere to mount it to it's more upgradeable than MacBooks okay that's a low blow what's hilarious is this is about the same cooling you'll find in a MacBook Air as well the Macbook will perform a lot better just to be very clear I'm not uh not saying these are equivalent products I'm just saying okay thermal pad rather than thermal paste and they actually left what appears to be Captain tape or a manufacturing peel on the bottom side of take that that's definitely don't short it yes so they just didn't bother to manufacture a cooler that doesn't short out the components in fact you can see there are a couple sharp ones that look like they're going to poke through it also they have this cooler that covers a bunch of other components but it's not transferring any heat it's just Capon taped yeah there's our third Ram slot though whatever Windows was reporting I don't think that's what that Wi-Fi chip is I thought it said mediatech something I don't know what FN link is I don't know they exist looks like they have actual good product not good but modern products fair enough like we talked about the 3 gig ram thing and I said I thought I figured it out but this is mounted right against the keyboard there's nothing on the other side of this PCB so is this that's the ram 3 gigs just like that thanks all that's left then is recommend or not recommend it comes with an activated Windows license of some sort so given that it basically comes for free with a copy of Windows I guess if all you need is a functioning computer at all it's kind of hard to beat it for the price but we would strongly recommend something a little bit more functional for a little bit more this managed a cinebench R15 score of just 89 which is not an acceptable amount of performance today for context an Acer asire 5 for under $300 can be had with a rise 3 quad core CPU an actual 1080p display 8 gigs of RAM and a 256 gig SSD and that's a real SSD not emmc flash it's not an amazing machine but we've looked at it before on the channel and it doesn't have any major weaknesses either and with a cinebench R15 score of 92 it could be argued that even though it's double the price it is more than 10 times the computer it'll also keep getting security updates for its CPU past um 3 months from now we're going to have a link to that down below in conclusion it's awful but also kind of endearing kind of like the way that I segue to our sponsor ug green imagine this you've caught your laptop open doing your laptopy things and you check your battery life what the heck how did your battery go down even though you've got it plugged in well it could be that your wall charger is just not powerful enough enter the ug green NEX Olde 100 watt charger which can supply up to well 100 watts of power more than enough to keep you going I'm sure what you're doing is super productive right but what if you need to charge multiple devices at once don't worry this portable power provider has three USBC ports one usba a port so you can charge your phone your laptop your other phone all at the same time cuz you know you're conducting business keep the party I mean the productivity going with the ugreen NEX old 100 watt charger check it out at the link below if you enjoyed this video maybe check out that dual screen AliExpress laptop that we checked out recently where our community actually figured out a bunch of stuff on the Forum to dramatically improve it
