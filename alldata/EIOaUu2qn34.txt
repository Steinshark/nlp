and yeah it's uh good morning everyone uh thank you for coming it's great to see so many of you here in the morning uh even after probably a late night last night um all right so uh as we said I want to talk a bit about helping open communities Thrive and uh my experience in um helping communities over the last 17 years uh to strive in the open and I hope some of that uh will be useful for your work here around C++ or other areas uh where you are involved so first of all disclaimer um I'm going to talk a bit about uh history uh of K and so on and of course all of this is from a particular Vantage Point um and necessarily not the whole story right um but I hope uh the important parts so let's start a bit uh about me why I'm talking to you about this um so for the past 17 years uh as I said uh I've been contributing to a number of uh free and open projects um both software projects as well as open knowledge projects um after I studied uh computer science I've been contributing to KDE for most of uh that time and for since 2011 uh I'm on the board of the nonprofit behind K uh K EV um and uh I was the past president and I'm currently the vice president of that organization uh that's my volunteer life and most of what I'm going to talk about in my um work life I work for Wikipedia uh on Wikipedia's Knowledge Graph called wik Data uh so if you ever need data for your project about the world that's the place to go um and I also uh in my volunteer capacity support uh the video U people so those are the the guys behind uh VC the video player with the cone um basically advising them in in governance stuff and so on so and I believe that gives me um a fairly good picture good view into uh the picture of these communities and through all of this uh this work while I studied computer science and I'm rather technical person most of the contributions I've made to those projects are not on the technical side but more on the community governance strategy and product management site so to give you some context I need to talk a bit about KDE and give you a bit of a uh recap on history of KDE so um KDE started uh in 1996 uh it was started by a guy called Matias atrish and you sent this email or rather News Group post that you can still find online today um titled new project cool desktop environment programmers wanted um we cringe a bit at the cool today which is why it's no longer the cool desktop environment but KDE um we've grown um and it's a rather long post uh but he uh he is trying to Rally people around the idea of building a desktop environment and specifically he calls out stuff like um wanting to build a GUI for end users so he writes the idea is to create a GUI for an end user somebody who wants to browse the web with Linux uh write some letters and play some nice games specifically he's talking about his girlfriend um but basically he wants more people to be able to to work on on Linux in a in a nice environment also important he talks about already in that email uh about cute um uh which he calls a very nice easy to ous powerful C++ library and he's really trying to get people on board uh he writes I don't have the time to do this all alone uh also since licks is my main project the lates editor um but a thing like a desktop environment can easily be cut into to lots of Parts uh there's very probably a part for you too if you want to learn some ACT programming why not do the small need projects for K and already here um this is going to become more important later he's talking about uh K as a place to learn and uh he ends us with I admit the whole thing sounds like a bit like a fantasy but a very serious from my side everyone is talk I'm talking to in the net would love a somewhat cleaner desk and cute is a chance to realize that um so let us join our rare spare time and just do it that was kind of the attitude Matas brought into this so what to take away from this um first of all Matias was a rather uh unusual founder in that he was he started this project but then uh was fairly hands off um for the rest um of the project um also K has always considered itself a rather uh technically excellent and pragmatic Community it's been close to cute from the start it's been considering itself a place to learned from the start and it's always put end users as the focus um not uh too long after that already uh kdev the nonprofit behind it um was founded and it was established as a organization that supports the KD community and Legal Financial organizational matters um like having someone who can sign some papers for a conference for example to host um or to be the party in the uh Kat fig Foundation to secure uh cute uh staying free and open so and for many years K EV has very explicitly not gotten itself involved in the development it has not paid for development for a very long time it has not tried to influence the development but always supported the the kitty Community to do the development it wanted to do this has changed a bit in recent years but that was very uh important at the beginning and over all these years um as an organization it has provided a lot of continuity um for the project and the community behind it um um Now history goes on kitty1 is released isn't it isn't it beautiful it's really um anyone here by chance who has K Used K1 nice very nice uh and we move on to KY 2 any K2 users nice more the like expected this is really cool um we move on to Kitty 3 we get a bit more presentable um KY3 who are you yeah cool um and kd3 was kind of a Crossroads um for KY uh when the kitty3 series came to an end uh cute was moving to cute 4 um major breaking changes major rethinking of what um what is going to happen so and this is roughly the time I joined um Kitty now why why did I get to Kitty um I've always been interested in uh technical things and computers uh from rather early on and I always loved the idea of being able to build something um to Tinker with something and the idea of uh creating something in the open and when I was studying computer science at some point I was like hm this window thing really not doing it um there has to be something better and at that time Ubuntu was the rage so I was like okay let's give this a try um I installed it and tried it for an hour and was like like it's not bad but we're just not clicking um and then I looked around a bit more and people were saying like yeah there's also this other thing called kubuntu um which is basically the same but different um so I like okay fine let's try that and I installed it I used it for an hour and was like oh my God my mind is blown this is amazing uh this is the thing um and the the thing that hooked me was integration so here for example you see Kitty's um messenger up at that time uh copete and in copete you could say hey to this messenger contact get their address from the address book and send them an email with email program or from the file manager you could say send this file to that um to that uh contact in coped I was like oh my God this is amazing um from coming from Windows with shareware freeware all this integration was just not did not exist um so I was hooked um and like yeah okay I'm going to use this this this is great um and then uh I talked to this guy uh s uh who I was studying with and he was like hey you're you're using KD's uh software right I like yeah yeah hm I'm doing marketing for their for amarok their music player um why don't you help us like okay I can do this I can help you write release announcements and so on um and at some point he said like you know what in two weeks there's Linux T in Berlin and you're coming with us I was like oh my God I have no idea what I'm doing um but there we were um and finnally enough people who came to the booth were like asking all of them were asking the five same questions I had this I had this figured out quickly so that was good um but the much more important thing that happened there is that I got to meet a lot of uh other KD contributors for the first time in person um and um that's basically what made me stay um it's the people in that Comm right um and over the years people having faith in me and and letting me try stuff letting me also fail at some things um and through that learning um a ton um so for example today uh I would not have my day job uh without all the things that I learned in in Kitt um my computer science degree is great but it did not get me my job so in K we say come for the code uh stay for the community and that's really I think a a core thing that is true for many communities um so here you can see our uh grp photo from our last conference in uh Tessalon in Greece it was great um okay back in history kitty3 um I joined and uh that was around the time when ktie came into had quite some trouble years I would say um because over the course of a few years many things came together um we were moving from a central SBN repository to get um very decentralized every program had their own G repository of course as opposed to how it was before in a in a monolithic SN repository which meant that people who worked together before in the same code base started drifting apart um cute moved from cute 3 to cute 4 as I was saying earlier um kd4 uh was very much uh a revolution not an evolution so we basically threw a lot of the work we've done before away and started basically from scratch with very good ideas and intentions and Visions behind it um but let's say the execution of that initially and the way the public uh expected it to be did not match um people were not happy at the beginning um which of course is not great for the people contributing to that right if it's like why did you destroy what I have been using for so long why did you why did you break everything why did you move everything uh why can I no longer do this um on top of that the initial Vision that we had that Matia set out as a desktop environment for end users on Linux we we kind of checked that off but also H not really um and then questions came like does anyone even need a desktop anymore is this is this does anyone care or is everyone going to move to mobile phones anyway um and then there was a lot of push to uh change the framing of of what KD is from K is the software that we release to KD is the community that releases that software all of that was uh leading to I would say a rather unhappy Community a very stressed Community a very splintering community and a bit of an identity crisis um if you want so what do you do then um to not have everyone freak out basically how do you how do you keep uh people together and what we did um are three things over several years um the first of which was to create a Manifesto to basically Define who are we what defines us what um what does it mean to be KDE um and we wrote down values uh in that Manifesto after a lot of discussion and we um we ended up with open governance um free software inclusivity Innovation common ownership that was very important for us everyone K should be able to commit to every uh piece of the code for example and um an end user Focus but that's of course not enough um we also had to explain okay what's the benefit of actually coming to KDE with your project um and we we call out things like you get to make use of Kitty's uh infrastructure you get to be a part of a large community that does for example translations bug fixing bu triage for you and much more you get representation of the nonprofit behind it um you get more visibility um through Kitty's promotion and so on and of course uh something that doesn't just come with benefits but also commitments so if uh someone came like hey I have this project and I want to come to K with that project I want to make it a k project um we also had some expectations um towards them now for the first time actually written down and agreed on like respect our code of conduct uh be aligned with our vision and Mission do not have a mandatory contributor licensing agreement um have some technical uh requirements checked off like um if you have an online service then our assment team needs access to that and stuff like that um and the same for copyrights and trademarks and patents and this basically for the first time gave was um a shared understanding of should this project join KDE and what are the expectations we have towards that project as opposed to 500 people having 500 different interpretations of what it means to be a k project um very helpful also very painful um so that was nice and useful but it didn't fix all our problems because um we still weren't able to pin down okay why do we exist now now that we've kind of achieved but not really mat's initial Vision so um a bit later we started looking at okay what's our new vision what's our new Mission and we ended up after a lot of painful discussion with uh KD and wish in the world in which everyone has control over their Digital Life and enjoys freedom and privacy so one important thing to note here is that for example it doesn't talk about a desktop um but it does talk about um uh being in control of your Digital Life um Freedom privacy right um which opened up KDE Beyond this um KD is a desktop no it's a community de among many other things makes a desktop and then um since this is very lofty we like okay how do we do this how do we give people um control over the Digital Life and freedom and privacy so we said um ktie has taken on a mission to create software products which give users control freedom and privacy um we give them an excellent experience user experience in quality software um we give that to them regardless of their location background abilities operating system and device and we are here to promote free and open source uh software and free and open source ecosystem so again this gave us much more clarity and also told some people like yeah okay what you want to do is maybe not what you get to do in KDE so after we had that um it was it was really helpful and and people kept referring to this say hey but according to our vision um we said we would do this or we said we wouldn't do that but still it doesn't give us okay what do we do now what what do we do what do we do together as one Community as opposed to everyone doing their own thing in their own little corner of this massive project so we set out uh to set um goals and socialize them and this um basically meant we would make a call um for people to make proposals for what KDE should focus on over the next two to three years and anyone anyone if they K contributor or not could come and and make a suggestion make a proposal um and after some time we would have a have a discussion period where people could ask questions refine the proposals um and maybe say hey I don't think this is a good idea and here's why um maybe we shouldn't be doing this or here's how I think this should be done differently this should be done how this could be improved and then um after all of that uh we had a list of potential goals for kitty for the next uh years and we set out to do a vote among uh active contributors for the top three and um we've gone through this process for three uh the third time now and in initially in 2017 um the outcome of uh that that first uh vote was top not usability and productivity for basic software so hey let's make all our software more usable and more more productive for people privacy software let's look at privacy issues in in our software let's make people more aware of the privacy the implications of doing something and uh last but not least streamlined onboarding uh of new contributors to make it easier for people to join now the interesting thing that happened here is that of those initial three winning goals two of them were proposed by people from outside K and uh this was very much an AA moment for me because this whole process gave them um um the the ability to say oh I I have something I I have an idea I think this is this is good um and I'm willing to put time into making it happen which before that they they didn't feel empowered to do um and um since then they have become some of the most prolific contributors to K so uh I consider it quite a success um so we forb this in um 2019 um with uh the winners uh being consistency um so making all of our software more consistent um Wayland getting ready for Wayland And apps which is okay let's work towards making it clearer that people can use individual apps from KDE also outside a kitty plasma desktop and the current ones uh voted in last here um k for all so this is all about accessibility um improvements sustainable software Energy Efficiency and more and uh last but not least automate and systematize internal processes so basically all the things that a community does at talk sometimes let's automate some of that let's not have a single point of failure person things like that so while all of these processes were rather painful to go go through um this is really really helpful for keeping a project as large as KDE together and United and working towards something that um all all people like most people in a community agreed like yes let's focus on that and of course this is not all that kitty does but it it sets a focus and it makes it clear hey if you want to contribute in one of those areas that's a good idea so after those rather difficult years um where is K today um we have clearer goals um I would argue we have better software uh we have Partnerships uh to get our uh software directly to end users uh so this our Hardware Partnerships um we have stayed true to our values that we laid out many many years ago we have a more cohesive community and we're able to mat much more clearly articulate why we exist what we do and why we do it and you can see this for example here um in in these Kitty for you Pages um as just one example um which is a website where you can find specific Pages for certain groups and how K can help them so for example we have uh KY for activists or KD for students for travelers and so on so these are the pages that tell you hey hear the things from K that would be interesting for you right now there are about um 600 active developers um and I would say uh as many in non-developer roles so organizing um events and things like that um with a size of about 50 million lines of code um 80% roughly uh of which are C++ K software today is used in lots of places like C uh NASA in Hollywood U for example in uh the shooting of gravity avatar The Hobbit um steam de is using Plasma on the W is using Plasma on their steam deck devices um which you can turn into uh from the gaming console you can connect it to a screen and have basically a desktop that's plasma and many more in terms of most successful applications I would say plasma uh CR or painting application uh Kaden life uh which is amazing for video editing Kate our text editor she gr a learning suit for kids um KD connect which uh connects your phone to your uh computer and KD frame um more on the library side so and uh what is KD not um and I feel like C++ is in a similar situation KD is not the latest hype of the day um Kitty rarely runs after the latest big Tech hype uh be that Bitcoin large language models or what have you um if you're someone in that um then KD is probably not the project for you and I feel like C++ is maybe also not the project for you um so instead we're focusing on what actually improves lives and sometimes this might be one of those Technologies right but um so far um but the problem with uh some of that is that it's sucking up a lot of the energy and a lot of the good people um that may be able to contribute to something in my opinion more meaningful um and I think um a clearly people centered Vision in the case of KD without a profit U motive behind it can act as a as a nice antidote to still get people interested in this and and um contribute to it so over this years after learn a lot of lessons some of them painful um so here's me trying to tell you about them so you don't have to go through the pain um first of all so I'm going to talk a bit about um lessons for you as an individual for community and then for society let's start with you as an individual um do take care uh of yourself do not make any of this the center of your life the center of your un Universe um this is probably the hardest uh for me to to actually live by um and one of the things how do uh that happens is train your successors um have a succession plan if if you're gone life happens um who is going to continue the work that you've been doing um think about that talk to that person talk to those people or even better to not be the single point of failure for something in the first place again very hard especially in an open Community with um resources um and one thing I've noticed um in a lot of communities is that the leaders in those communities uh sometimes tend to have this urge to be the the first to answer a question the first to answer to a bug report the first person to review a merch request [Music] um this if this is you try not to do that um try to give others some space to be the first um try to let them answer that support question try to let them do a first code review and then go in um that's one way to grow people into um into the roles you need them in but you also need to be able to let go have patience um and this is this is hard um and one Mantra uh that we have in in Wikipedia um that has helped me with this is good enough for now safe enough to try you might have worries about something but it's good enough and yes we can try this the world will not end and this cuts down uh on discussions quite a lot because a lot of times people discuss about the last 10% that maybe do not matter that much try it um another thing I've uh realized over the years is that uh free and open projects are kind of the ultimate leadership tests right if you're in a leadership position in one of those projects um you're really forced to Rally people behind you you basically never almost never can tell them what to do you need to convince them and you need to engage them and one way to think about this is that people need uh three things to have fun in a in a task and a job in in in a position um and that's Mastery autonomy and purpose Mastery you need to be able to feel that you can do the task it might be a little challenging but you need to be able to do it if if you're completely lost and overwhelmed it's not fun you're not going to going to do it autonomy um you need to have a bit of space to do your thing um you can't constantly have someone micr manage you and tell you what to do and what not to do surprise and last thing purpose um why am I doing this is this is this interesting is this useful is this meaningful um and the cool thing about open projects most of the time the purpose piece is just check um and in general trust people to positively surprise you take a chance on people um trust Falls are hard but let people positively surprise you um another thing if you ever find yourself in in some sort of leadership maintainership whatever uh position in in an open project it can be very lonely it can be isolating and what really helps um is to find someone in a similar position in another project um someone you can go to and say like oh my God they're driving me nuts today or I have this problem I do not know how to deal with it um what do you think or just I need to Wi for 10 minutes um and you need to listen to me because often you can't necessarily do this with the people in your community um so find someone in a adjacent communities um who can be that person for you now let's look at the community scale for communities culture matters and as a community you're advertising your culture everywhere this for example is a a group photo from uh the will Lear conference uh in Dublin earlier this year and uh one of the things uh videoan does every year at their conferences is um hand out the cones the cone heads and then they do a treasure hunt through the city so for the day uh first day of the conference the city is filled with people with Cone Heads running around which is amazing and you get so many people asking you like why are you why are you doing this what what's the deal what's the deal with your cone um and then you get into a conversation like yeah yeah yeah we we're working on this project and we're doing a treasure hunt can you help us with this question do you know where this and that is it's very nice um oh here magnet fishing um or here from Wikipedia um Wikipedia has the Wikipedia acuteness Association and this is is quer Buu one of the members of the cuteness Association um so basically whenever there's a conference people bring their plushies and there group photos of the plushies and travel pictures and so on like it's it's very nice um oh here this is a screenshot from wi data uh the project I'm working on uh at Wikipedia and wik wikid dat has these data pages just basically and everything that b describes has a unique identifier random well not quite so Random you can see that there are nerds behind this project um darkus adoms for example is q42 um there are more um or here uh which is my favorite edit on Wikipedia and if you want more of these I can highly recommend following um an account on Twitter or Instagram um Called Death of Wikipedia where Annie is posting a ton of really cool pictures so what happened here is there was an article with this picture and um the uh it said Piper car a me member of the Scottish national Arctic Expedition placed the back pipes for an indifferent penguin March 1904 okay and then someone someone I know um makes an edit and says Piper Care on the right I mean it's important to to specify this right um there's a ton of this stuff in Wikipedia I can highly recommend depth of Wikipedia it's lovely um so again uh people come for the code people stay for the community and stuff like this your culture um and besides all the things I showed you another way how you advertise your community and how you advertise the culture of your community are discussions right if you're discussing in the open um you're basically never just discussing with the person you're discussing with there are a ton of bystanders who will take that into account in understanding what community this is what's allowed here what kind of tone you're setting and and uh how you interact with each other and here uh initial tone setting of a community is especially important so if you ever uh are in a position to start a new community think about what kind of community you want because the initial setting is very hard to get around later in the life of that Community um a community needs a clearly articulated why this is as I was explaining earlier with Kitty right the reason why we went through all this pain of defining our vision our mission our goals to to really have that and and um have that um agreed upon because you can't just uh dictate that from above um if you want buy in for for such a thing you need to create this collaboratively with people and the goal um or the end result the artifact that you create like our vision is great but just as important and maybe even more important is the process how you got there all the discussions you had getting there um as painful as they might be and um for this it can be if you're going through such processes it can be immensely valuable if you have someone lead those processes who is not invested in a particular outcome so I for example was um leading the process around the creation of the vision for k um but I didn't care about what we end up with um I I cared that we have one um but the details of what is in it I didn't care about as much and that really helped um in the discussions um speaking of discussions um one thing uh that has helped me immensely from um nonviolent communication training is uh dism of listen to understand not to respond uh often times and just as much in in real world discussions as in in mailing list post or on chat or whatever is we read we listen to be able to respond um instead of listening to understand what the other person has to say try not to do that um it really makes a difference in discussions and in how that other uh person feels hurt or does not feel hurt by you um one thing I um I try to live by is people should never be surprised by what I do um and that means um there should have been a time before any major major thing um where we talked about it where we discussed it where people felt like yeah okay I could I could have my say I could give my input and I was hurt um and a painful thing here is especially in open communities you have to say something so many times you can't hear it yourself anymore um you've basically got to preach it for people to hear it um and do not expect people to hear the first time you say something or you announce something or you uh think you have agreed on something um can be very frustrating sometimes but it's good to keep in mind um and one thing that helps with this is having a regular agreed upon and advertised way to stay up to date right my first point was do not make this the center of your universe and that also means not for many people not being able to stay up to date on everything that's happening in your community so what what I try to do um in communities where I'm involved in is get them to the point where they have some sort of um Regular update of what's Happening that's short and concise so for example for Wick data we have this uh weekly summary which is just a uh once a week for the past 11 years 12 years almost um uh message that uh people get sent by email and on Wiki and on social networks um with anything that that's important um and for K we have uh Nate uh who publishes these blog posts this week in KDE which is also trying to summarize the most important things that have been going on in K in that week and that's an nice and easy way to stay up to date also for people who who are maybe just occasional contributors or who really do not have the time to stay up to date with everything that's happening uh in your potentially large community um and then uh communities need ryles rituals and rhythms um so this can be stuff like birthdays uh Awards you give out uh conferences like this one um immensely helpful so for example for for Wick data we uh celebrate the birthday uh where people come together and there's birthday presents that people have like they they code little things they write documentation and so on it's really lovely um there's cake cake is always good um or for K we have the Academy Awards um where every year we give out uh Awards to people who have um done something significant for the kitty Community um and then the really lovely part I think about this is that we do this at our annual conference and and then everyone gets to to sign these Awards so you you have a an award to take home with signatures from people in the community and it's a really nice thing um now to make stuff like that happen you need people who are connectors right the people who say hey you should talk to that people that person um hey you should come to that event you should uh get together and and do this um and those people are invaluable so anyone who organized this conference thank you um so if you don't have them in your project um um see if you can find them right um see if you can find ways to to bring those people to your cont to your community who who bring people together um and as as we've seen with the goal process right where in the first round two of the three winning goals came from people who had um not made significant contributions to K before and your barriers are killer and in my experience so much of that entry barrier is in people's heads and not feeling like they they're good enough not feeling they are allowed to uh contribute to your project not um feeling that um they can make a difference um so think about ways how you can um give people that um allow people to to join allow people to to to bring in their ideas and and so on um all right now let's look um more at the society level uh I think we need a lot more tinkering and I think uh you're the type of people who are very much um in that space so um please go out and um get more people um around you who might not um be the type to Tinker with something and it doesn't even have to be Tech right uh can be knitting I don't know um it I think really makes a difference um in in how people think about uh their life and how how much agency they believe they have um in society because I feel like we're moving more and more to a society that is um take what you're given as opposed to take something and make it work for you um and I don't think that's uh necessarily healthy for us um I think we need a a lot more open infrastructure uh to build on um and I thought this uh could um was very insightful on that um where it says for every shitty user hostile chain to a big tech service there exists a small independent service that could offer a viable replacement but continues to be ridiculed by the very users who complain about the shitty big tech service change so next time um some proprietary big tech service um gets on your nerves um think about this and think about uh supporting Alternatives where you are more in control um which brings me to uh the next point is about uh all of these open projects are tend to be held together by a very small number of people and especially if it looks different from afar so for example BLC is used by a gazillion of gazillion people um but their team is super small um and that puts a lot of strain on on that team right um so yeah um keep that in mind when you're making uh demands or have expectations towards those projects that they might not be able to fulfill but where you can help um support them because there's always something to do um and um even a little uh thing like a thank you to your favorite project um it helps a lot I hope this uh gave you some insights into open communities and um how you can help improve them and I hope it was helpful um thank you very much do we have time for questions yes okay audit questions hello hi um so you mentioned that the community needs a rhythm and also rituals and that really piqued my interest because what makes a good ritual for a community and what is it that a ritual actually does right um so what what a good ritual is I think depends a bit on your on your community of course um but um I would say things that happen regularly like anniversaries are always good things where people come together in real life are always good um occasions where you can somehow celebrate something um are always good and all of this um why why are rituals good um because I have noticed that if you don't have these regular points in time that that give people a rhythm um things tend to flunder and people tend to um just move on instead of saying hey let's look back at what we have achieved over the last year for example or let's now take the time to reflect on what's coming um and and what has happened and plan what's coming um yeah so anything that that has this regularity and and um reflective character uh tends to be helpful I would say so it's like a renewal of the identity you have basically yeah you could you could put it like that um you also mentioned that um also regularly meeting up in real life really helps facilitate a sense of identity um how do you say in general is like the difference from a purely online community to a uh let's say mixed Community with uh mostly online but also offline meetings yeah I I wish I had that Meme here but there's this um there's this GIF of two uh I think it's Bulldogs who are baring at each other through a fence and being like really um and then the fence is removed and they're like and it just personifies this hey when you when you actually see the person and when you um met them in real life you have much more to go on much much better understanding of who this person is um if you've shared a dinner with them I don't know uh then if you just know their name and their email address and and exchange uh um a chat message here and there right um and those can also be very valuable communities but I think there you can Elevate them um if if you can get people together in person thank you very much okay all right um there's some questions from the online world and I you know be asking of the the first one um it's a bit of serious question from honey as a woman have you ever faced the problem of getting your voices heard respectable of your technical competency and if so how do you deal with it um yes but those were the communities I didn't stay [Applause] in hi hi this is scarying uh like a more question can you maybe a missed but I don't think so can you maybe talk a little bit about C++ usage there so the stand compilers I don't know if everything is you need tested more or less like if there some hydrogenous devices targeted whatever I don't know anything about KD thank you um how K is using C++ yes um so as I was saying about 80% um from from the last uh check we did is C++ code um and largely through cute so um cute as the make C++ nicer let's say and uh what standards can you use uh can how modern compilers can you target um I cannot tell you that all thank you um but maybe Ian if he's here yes Ian do you have an answer to that question okay so the answer is depending on on the project uh mainly the Frameworks so the libraries used to follow what cute requires so whatever uh can be used to compile the current version of cute that works for Frameworks for other projects we could go berserk and go for C++ 23 in C in 2017 it just depends thank youan being in the KDE Community for all these years how does the K community help you as a person I'm sure you have a lot of learnings how the k Community has helped me as a person how um in in countless of ways um so while while I was studying uh I spent way too much time on on contributing to K if you ask my mom um but the good thing about uh that was um when I got a a student job next to my studies um I went to this company that does semantic we stuff um and I went to them and they had advertised the uh usability tester position for a student for a few hours um and I did some usability testing for them and then at some Point um the boss came and like this is no no let's not do this um I I saw that you do all this Community Management stuff um we need someone who does developer Outreach um and you're you're why don't you do that like cool um sounds great yes much more happy with that than uh usability testing um and that's how I met um the guy who founded wik and who was like Hey I need someone who does uh who knows how to manage communities who knows how to talk to wikipedians about this new project uh that's otherwise going to explode um and I was like yeah sure I can do this and none of that is anything I learned in uh in my studies um like yeah so how did it help me um on the one hand allowing me to do this like having a space where I can I can learn this and I can practice it and on the other hand also having a place where I can do this in the open and but people can recognize and see what I have done and um basically having that as my portfolio and saying like yes uh this person really knows what she's doing there and and this is this is going to be helpful for us um so there's an interesting question which I you know so how does KDE but also Viki like I I think you work for the foundation of the Viki uh data and vik media that's what your dat job is and how how do like projects like KDE survive financially and can you talk a bit about that side yeah um so KDE is largely funded uh by donations by individuals um that can be one of donations or or or regular donations and then um memberships in the nonprofit um supporting memberships which can either be for individuals um who pay1 a year or more uh depending on their choosing um to be a member of the association and support the project um and the same for for businesses who then pay a bit more um grants um so for example we had a had a grant from uh one of the German Ministries to work on a project uh to get the German uh Ecco seal the plow angle um the for for our PDF reader OC so kti has a first software that uh has an Eco seal from from the plow angle um ever not just free software but um so grants like that um and then a lot of of the organizations around it some of them uh put their people to work on stuff in K so for example wal um paid some people through consultancies for example to improve plasma so it uh can be uh so it can do what they wanted to do on the steam deck um yeah I think you already answered the question that I had so I was wondering how the collaboration with external companies uh contributing to KDE and development or external or other things works if it's all happy or there's training I don't know with the vision that KY has how's your experience with that yeah um so yes I I believe they are the ones we have are happy that's why we have them um the supporting memberships in the nonprofit uh give these companies um a seat on The Advisory Board um and space at our annual conference and general uh good wipes about hey this is a company just like here uh who who supports this community and and who invests in this community um so those are the the the official uh K EV pieces and then um the companies who hire people uh to work on KDE that's of course at the end of the day um just like any other contributor right but one with a lot more time and maybe some direction from their boss um but their contributions go through um through regular channels just like any other uh contribution thanks hi uh long-term user love love KD amazing uh I I want to ask a question more like a from a point of so I'm work at the commercial development and we have all the structure like you know you have a system supporting stuff and you have a management and so how does all of this works in the open source Community when everyone is just volunteering so how who assigns tasks who maintains infrastructure how does it all work together like do you have informal leadership like how is it I'm very curious yeah um it varies from Project to project I would say um for KDE uh the only official representative body is the KDE EV and and um from the membership of K EV we elect a board that can for example sign contracts and stuff like that and say hey yes this is the uh location where we have Academy next year or conf friends and stuff like that um but when it comes to the individual projects a lot of it is meritocracy if you do the work you have more say um and uh if you've been contributing for a longer time your word probably also counts more um some um K project have official maintainers um who then can in uh in case it's needed make a decision like this is what we're doing this is not what we're doing um but rarely is that um the person who who has been voted into that position um to have that power but it's more they've put in the work to be in that position um yeah and for for Wikipedia it's it's similar uh you have administrators for example who get voted in and you only get voted in if you can show that you have a track record of good work on the project and um so on great thank you and uh one small question why did you stop naming projects with Kay like what happened projects with K yeah like coner copit and amarok and all them I mean we we the cool desktop environment so the K as a on top of that um KD was founded in tubing in in Germany so K was um and for a long time we we stuck to the K we've gotten over the K almost um but yeah it's it's it's one of those crooky things um at the end of the day that I was talking about yeah thank you yeah hey you said that in the beginning the k u Foundation resisted to fund projects uh so I guess right now they do but as soon as money is involved you get a big trouble with communities how to balance that who gets money who does not how do you deal with that in the KD Community yeah um so transparency um is is an important part um we've gone through a long process um around making a living um what's the what's the title where we said okay one of the big issues we see is that people contributing to KDE can most of the time do this while they studying or if they have a really nice boss who uh allows them to do it on the side or other such circumstances right um and that is not sustainable um unfortunately and we want people to to stick around longer term and that means giving them um a uh a base to live on basically um so we went through discussions okay if we do this um where should we put money what's what's meaningful um and the goals for example help with that right um so now what we have is um I want to say four uh for contractors who work on stuff like documentation getting framework six in shape for release um and uh packaging apps for App Stores um all of which are tasks that are not super high on people's preference list let's say so it's not the uh oh someone is taking away something I would have liked to do most of the time um that also helps yeah but it it's It's Tricky to navigate uh definitely and that's one of the reasons why why we stayed away from it for so long and do you have Administration work that is paid in in the yeah Foundation as well yeah so uh we have an assistant to the board who does an amazing job um without her we would be lost so she does all the paperwork accounting stuff like that um and we've had someone to do that for um I want to say 15 years or more um so that has has been a much more regular thing because it was very clear that the board does too many things and this is not meaningful time uh for the board to to to do that work we um we need them to do much more strategic work board still does too still does way too many um underground things if you ask me but that's also the reality of of a nonprofit like that yeah would guess it's very hard to balance that also how much do you pay for such a valued job as you described it and also like making a living for a developer depends on where he lives what he does uh so it's very hard to decide who to give funds uh also yeah you have like uh influence from the companies like you mentioned wolf uh they will push their own directive their own incentives so it's very hard to balance that with the community they might have different ideas and directions and but that's with uh external companies pushing in in some directions that's a nice thing right they they don't have more St um in terms of I'm the company and I give money and that's why I got to say it's more I'm paying someone to put time into it and that's why I probably have more say um which can also be tricky but is I think the better option but I guess you also run into the same issue you mentioned with the big tech companies who uh show away Services the users wanted uh you have companies contributing stuff yeah and then abandon it because it didn't get a commercial success yeah thanks again well um you talked about onboarding and I think that would be something interesting to uh get into like how do you join KDE host your mentoring how do you you know manage that within your community yeah um so we have basically two big routes I would say one is uh unstructured one is very structured uh the unstructured way is um when you get go to the Kitty uh website you will find uh get involved uh lat L and that uh tells you uh different ways how you can get involved as a developer as a uh translator as a promo person and so on um and then it's basically just joining and getting a feel for how things are going and then seeing where you can help um and asking uh where you can help um there's really someone pushing you to the next step there which is part of the the issue I was talking about earlier where people have this barrier in their head of not not feeling like they're empowered to do that next step um and then a much more structured uh way are our mentoring programs um so we take part in Google summer of code um and we have our own uh similar program called season of KDE where um so Google sum of code is a paid internship basically uh the season of KDE is uh less strict and not paid um but you do get a mentor by your site you get a clear project um that you can work on and if you complete that project and your Mentor says yes uh then you get a certificate and a t-shirt at the end uh which is usually nice for the people who are who are taking part in that and you have a very clear like this is my mentor this is the person I can go to if I have questions this is the person who's going to be a bit on my toes to make sure I'm actually doing stuff um so depending on what you want and need um that uh that are the two roads we have thank you I think we have a question yes uh thanks for the talk uh do you also have people who come to KDE after they retire from their jobs um probably um um I'm inclined to say that's very rare though but should be more maybe well people get older it's a it's a thing it's a thing yes I I do think everyone is welcome to join the community so yes um there was a question about contributions to KD from companies and we we have to happen to have uh someone here from kdab with Ian and I thought maybe Ivan wants to um tell us a bit about the contributions that kdab has made to uh KDE and um because I think it's like an interesting perspective to learn about okay so as the main issue with kdab and KDE is that everybody who knows me from KDE and they hear KDA be okay so you're still working for on the same thing right because everybody thinks that KD and kdab is the same thing and it it's not helped by the fact that onethird of kdab is KD developers so let's say it's a little bit fuzzy of um distinction and I would say that officially kdab uh contributed to KD in various software development tools like K develop Kate obvious ly Heap track clay the static analyzer Etc and some of the things and a little bit uh more fuzzy for example David forb who has been the maintainer of KD Frameworks since before Lydia and I was ever born uh he has been employed by kdab for ages and maintaining those Frameworks was largely a part of his work at KD but also his freework so it's kind of the edge is blurry but kdab as a company that kind of started From KDE is a huge contributor still and a very appreciated one thank you um so I'm going to see if we have more online questions but if you have a question uh that be kind of you know call now um so maybe it be interesting you know this um how did you as a community deal with the challenges that came with 2020 and being mostly remote and how like you know how this has shaped your contribution and how to uh you know KD be or no KDE is working know more remotely than it did before that maybe yeah um I don't think works more remotely now than it before because it has always been a community that's been spread out uh over over the whole world basically um with hotpots in in Germany in Brazil and India um but uh the pandemic of course uh forc us to uh not have our person conference um uh and instead do that online um we for quite uh some time didn't have Sprints so our smaller developer contributor meetings um and some of them went online but it's just not the same thing as getting people together in the same room um so one of the things we we had some years ago for example was someone in um uh in Switzerland uh in a small town in the alss called Randa uh who had a connection family connection to someone who has a huge old um youth hostel um and he would invite Kitty contributors there for a week five days to hike on stuff um in the middle of nowhere it's amazing and I wish we would still do that um highly recommend it um but anyway um so besides those those inperson meetings I don't think it changed that much in terms of how we interacted with each other I think it did change a thing a bit um the the motivation maybe even to to contribute to K in that I think some people including myself uh saw contributing to KDE and Wiki data other open project as a bit of a escape and as a hey here I can do something meaningfully to not go insane at home um so yeah that's what I would say to that okay there's one question on Wayland and K as you you had a slide on that this was one of your goals um is this but now like the default or just it like was it about like adding support for it um the goal was about um making a lot of changes in preparation for Wayland okay um so work in progress I would say but getting there and and people are using Wayland in their day-to-day work now um yeah but KS to be IR out all right thank you very much that was a very interesting keynote and question session so thank you very much everyone
