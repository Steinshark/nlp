we're here at CES 2023 in msi's booth and we have 10 laptops to look at and shockingly none of them are trash how did you do it MSI first of all stealth 14 Studio which we'll tell you about after this word from our sponsor thanks to Acer for sponsoring this video they've been working on their earthian initiative to be as sustainable as they are Innovative so stay to the end of the video to find out more this thing is freaking sick it is so rare that you get 14 inch laptops that are actually good but this thing has up to a 40 70 with a 90 watt TD feeder I got that right I did heck yeah this also has a 13700h but the most surprising thing is that it's really well built this thing has a magnesium chassis and only weighs 3.7 pounds look at this Andy it's like well built I'm genuinely shocked guys sorry it's not magnesium they're telling me that it's magnesium aluminum alloy very important to get that correct also important how is the keyboard it's fine it's what like maybe an A minus somewhere around there you guys can't get everything right but that said most of it is very good this thing also comes with up to a Quad HD 16 by 10 display that's 240 hertz that is so awesome on something like this it is just really impressive that it's a gaming laptop that you can just Chuck in your backpack and just go off and do whatever what also is impressive is the amount of battery life of this thing I'm sure it'll die pretty fast given how powerful it is but if you look at this it doesn't look all that big but when you sort of look at it from the side it is a thick boy this is what is this here 72 Watt hours and a laptop of this size is hecking impressive also of course they have a big old Vapor chamber here to keep everything cool and replaceable memory this stuff goes up to 5200 Mega transfers per second and that's the fastest that I've ever seen in a gaming laptop that has replaceable memory well until the next one that we see that 56. up next is the stealth 16 and they say that they have vastly improved the speakers on this thing it's six Speakers by Dyna audio and uh let's just see how good it is can it beat the HP it better because it's so much larger and has two more speakers but here we are six speaker Dyna audio seems pretty good it actually it actually does stage pretty well like it gets pretty wide not bad not bad kind of hard to tell because it's so loud in here but how does it compare to the HD and the lights better sorry guys they look so unimpressed the absolute best part is now they have to hold it for a prompter thank you very much what's fortunate though is that if you're not fully satisfied with those speakers though you're able to pair a second Bluetooth speaker as like rear fill surround it's actually super cool so if we play this here are we allowed to play this what is what is this okay so weird because it does actually process surrounds so that's a rear speaker it's so cool like you can see how it's set up here in the software like there's laptop there's the Bose speaker you can even program in the rear delay that's a really cool way to use Bluetooth speakers thank you oh there's a sport Atmos nice aside from the speakers this is also just a very good feeling laptop again magnesium aluminum alloy chassis and uh let's see how the keyboard is it once again is aggressively fine and of course this thing has all of the power that you need for gaming up to a core I9 13700h and a 4070 with 105 watt TDP now I just want to get really mad at Nvidia for a second here uh that's sort of like the top end of the 4070 but it can be down to 35 Watts that is just unacceptable guys why would you do that anyway moving on next up is something that I was not expecting to see here though this right here is the Raider ge78hx with their smart touch pad look at this where is it where's the touchpad I don't see anything well look at that all of this right here is touch pad area and they've actually done it in a pretty smart way so it isn't just a large touch pad where you're able to have programmable macros here on the right as well so you can you know use your touchpad for actual useful things instead of just turning it off when you're gaming with a dedicated Mouse very cool anyway we'll look at the normal one oh geez how heavy did you say this thing was six and a half pounds 6.8 pounds of absolute gaming chunk this right here is the ge78 Raider HX which is kind of the same as the last one but without the big touchpad and with a lot more RGB they're kind of like oh it's like retro oh wow that actually does look really cool I've only seen it from the top but when you look at there it's kind of like the ionic five of course the specs of this thing are absolutely Bonkers so you get up to a core I9 13 980 HX terrible name Intel excellent CPU 24 cores in a laptop that go up to 5.6 gigahertz that is freaking crazy not only that but the memory is replaceable and it's 5600 Mega transfers per second how the heck did they do that that's like outside of the sodium standard I think of course this has the beefiest mobile GPU that you can get so that's the 4090 that's what 16 gigabytes of vram and that's 175 watt TDP the total TDP of this thing is 250 Watts even though they have the largest battery that you can legally put on a plane 99 Watt hours in here that's what like one two hours battery life something like that one and a half they're saying yep oh no engineering sample sorry it's going to be better later I'm sure no on physics says it won't but what physics does say is that this right here is one heck of a heatsink look at all of that copper right there it's just beautiful and look at how big these heat sinks are it goes all the way up there it's like a whole inch of fins also not only do they have dedicated heat pipes for the CPU and GPU they even have a heat pipe for your vram they've gone so hard on this thing it's just so pretty I love that they left it just as copper is it painted on the inside nope wonderful absolutely love it but I know what you all are thinking 6.8 pounds that's all the MSI has no here we have the Titan and this one's 7.2 oh my God what a ridiculous machine this is it has Cherry MX switches which actually feel really good let's just uh have a little typey type here that's like an easy a maybe even a plus it's about as good as you can get for a keyboard on a laptop because well it's mechanical Cherry switches and all that it costs you is it being this thick and what's the starting price of this guy 42.99 geez we should go look at the more budget options if you're more budget conscious this right here is what you want this right here is the cyborg 15 and it starts at just one thousand dollars now that gets you an i5 and a 40 50 but that still is pretty good and even though this whole thing is made out of plastic well this right here is aluminum but that doesn't really count it feels really good like look at this I'm gonna just push on it here even msi's top laptops of just a couple years ago they just flop all around like an LG gram or something this one right here not a single problem and more good news the keyboard is no better or no worse than they're much more expensive stealth lineup so a minus maybe somewhere around there but I'm still pretty impressed and sure you don't get anything fancy like a mini LED display but I don't know who cares 1080p 144 Hertz is going to be good enough for most of you and especially if you only have like a 40 50 or a 40 60 you're probably not going to be pushing 4K anyway I really want to get this thing into the lab what's the TDP on the 4060 oh they just told me that the TDP on the GPU and this is 45 Watts maybe it won't be a little fast but 1080p you can still probably do that we'll need to get this into our lab everybody knows that MSI has heaps of gaming laptops though what really impressed me here is the way they've stepped up their game for create oh my God this is light this thing's just 2.2 pounds which is the same as an LG gram but shockingly it doesn't feel like a wet noodle again just MSI you made laptops that don't flex all over the place I'm so impressed my keyboard is like a solid a it's not the best I've ever felt but to hang that slight also we have a 1980 by 1200p display that gets up to 400 nits and what I really appreciate is that they haven't taken the bezels right down to nothing this is fantastic because I can actually put my hands on it so many 13-inch devices it's just kind of like that because they took so much time to make this super small and the whole device sort of does not benefit from that also the real fantastic thing about this is the battery somehow they have fit a 75 watt hour battery into this thing giving you an actual 15 hours of battery life it's a genuinely good guys I'm I'm impressed I want to have this for like a proper run not only that but they give you two Thunderbolt fours it's HDMI 2.1 2.1 band 2.0 boo all right never mind well half points for that wait oh there's a headphone jack geez I almost thought they dealt us there for a second fantastic work guys and also full size type a and a Micro SD card reader this is this is really good it's the LG Ram that we've been wanting for years that LG just has not made at all as the cherry on top this thing gets the 1360p so that gives you four performance cores eight efficiency cores and something this big now I'm sure it's not going to have the same level of performance as something like the 13 plus because uh well this right here is what you get for cooling but at the same time that's a lot better than something like the HP dragonfly Elite that only gets the U if you want a slightly larger Creator laptop we have the prestige 14 Evo and the CPU in this is very strange so it's the i7 13620h weird name weird CPU so you get six performance cores and four efficiency cores so half the efficiency cores of the 13 but I don't know sure maybe someone wants that well you probably do want though is a 40 60. if you go up to the 16 inch that is what you can get I'm sure this thing right here again okay this one's a little bit more flexible it's not too bad it feels like the same key switches a a minus somewhere around there what's really cool though look look at this look at this so this is the new pen for the Creator z17 and watch I can just write something here because this tip is graphite but then I can also come over to the laptop and still write things they currently don't know how much graphite tips will be when this one runs out but they did say that there's a plastic one that's also included so yeah I think it should be what like three bucks four bucks for a couple of them they say it'll last three years but uh we can see how much it's worn down just from today so uh there is one fatal flaw of the pen though look look at this this is It's magnetic guess where it Clips on go anywhere else guys nothing anyway fortunately the rest of it is fantastic so this has a Quad HD display the 16 by 10 version and it's 165 Hertz that is so good for something like this also we have a RTX 4070 in here with a 90 watt TDP look at this Vapor chamber they have for it overall though I'm super impressed like they have actual laptops that aren't floppy it's fantastic especially that Prestige 13 75 watt hour battery that is fantastic I can't wait to get these into the office to properly test them out and I can't wait to tell you about our sponsor Acer Acer's been working on their green initiative earthion to bring awareness and contribute to a Greener future Acer's eartheon is a mission platform for them to build towards a Greener future they tackle this through six different aspects of their business product design
