ladies and gentlemen this video is one of the most insane stories I have ever seen in my life it is about an individual who just got into chess two months ago and in that time has done nearly 2 000 puzzles and has played 2 000 rapid games recently Crossing 1 000 ELO I have never seen something like this in my life before and in this video our protagonist is tyler1 some of you may know who tyler1 is some of you may not know who tyler1 is let me introduce you to tyler1 this is tyler1 not to be confused with Tyler zero or two or whatever this is tyler1 he is a streamer who primarily plays League of Legends which is why his physique is so built it's from spamming all those Mouse clicks uh tyler1 is an extremely charismatic and slightly terrifying individual and as a dedication to him I am actually wearing a tank top myself in this video my muscles are not that big tyler1 recently competed in the chess.com Champs tournament and he wasn't that good when he started but that did not stop his confidence for as I'm going to show you in this clip where he called me out and kikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlson uh adults there's going to be a bad word or two you might want to you know put your hands over your kids ears kids if your parents are watching just tell them to leave the room for a second Tyler might say a bad word or two also volume warning and uh yeah I mean if he just fine-tunes a couple things plays the openings just the shut the [ __ ] up with your backseat gaming I'm self-taught who are you bro put me one put give me 1v1 against this guy I'll put 10 grand I beat I'll beat this guy first try who's this guy to say that he can beat me in chess you didn't play me bro I level up to my opponent by the way I level up I like match the competition you can put me against that hikiro guy or the Magnus Carlsen guy I will body them bro hikiro or Magnus carlston or me playing tyler1 for a ten thousand dollar match now he might have challenged Andrea and actually succeeded uh but that's besides the point in any case at that time Tyler was rated around 200. well now two months later he is nearly 1100 it is absolutely ridiculous his growth has been nothing like I've ever seen in the last 30 days he has played 1200 games of Chess that is 40 rapid games a day that is and that's not even human this man has done oh my God I lied to you he's done 3 500 puzzles his puzzle rating is 2300 this is completely insane I really I'm not exaggerating this is this is insanity and he has gotten all the way up to 1056 rapid in this video I'm going to take you through this journey I'm going to show you his early chess career and I'm going to show you his recent chess career because this is otherworldly stuff I mean truly this is absolutely nuts uh wow my goodness uh what what can I say um and uh oh and just by the way a little offhand remark uh today we announced uh the chess kid national festival chess kid is like chess.com but for children uh it's a very kid-friendly kid safe 2024 February um I'm gonna be a big part of it so there's a link in the description I'll put in I'll talk about it a little bit more it's in February it feels like 10 years away anyway this is the first ever game that uh tyler1 played on chess.com and like most games on chess.com in your first game um this is how it went this is July 2023. this is about 60 days ago okay tyler1 plays a game plays E4 E5 and then he takes a pawn and you know for some reason here he plays Pawn to F6 because you know first first chess game you ever play it happens uh his opponent takes back on in the center and then goes here and and the Knight actually gets trapped uh that's you know that's not a great move um of course White's Queen should come down here with Queen to D5 check but that is that's it's we're a little bit you know above the pig right here and Tyler's actually winning Tyler's actually his very first game on chess.com that's how you know he's a god gamer he's never played chess before and he's beating an 800 level player unfortunately it is short-lived here the queen is targeting the F7 square and C5 uh and uh black has to defend both of those things by playing Queen E7 or queen f8 Tyler gives a check and unfortunately very promptly gets checkmated however he was winning I mean you got to give the guy some credit like this is how you know you have hope in chess because the very first game you play you don't know anything about the game and you still you still get a winning position now the next game he played it was really funny because you know he he played some pawn moves again you I'm not I'm not judging his chess play here I'm just judging the result as a whole uh the players pushed a bunch of Pawns uh tyler1 took on A4 and blundered the bishop that's fine okay takes then he played here here and here and here and here his opponent resigned that this was the first ever game that tyler1 won he was completely lost and either his opponent resigned or abandoned the game maybe they were afraid of his muscles you know uh I I don't know uh but but he won this game for some reason so these were his first two games on chess.com now things were going very poorly in the beginning all right he was you know he was watching my videos and losing a lot of games kind of like you guys do um and you know he was trying out different openings and and he was just kind of like learning learning the the early strategies and and trying to not fall into tactical uh blunders and traps and all these different things um he got up to about 500 rapid but he was still kind and he's got the black pieces in this game uh this is this game was played July 18th so about you know 10 days into his chess career and as you can see still very much uh you know rough around the edges still not quite there with with the with the understanding um set up a whole little wall here but his opponent broke through very quickly uh immediately hitting the bishop uh and the Knight into the pawn on E6 Tyler didn't defend it and then Knight takes f8 and then and then it actually goes from bad to worse here because instead of taking this uh yeah Tyler hangs hangs his Queen so er early age of his career was just like the early stage of any chest you know he might watch this this hatch is still on on the table I'm pretty sure I wouldn't chest box Tyler you know I wonder though don't muscles that big get tired if you throw punches I don't know Tyler don't hurt me I'm just analyzing your chess games um and his opponent did a nice job here cleaning up and then just took the e-file and Tyler just got mated um you know he had finished his opening on move eight and on move 19 he was checkmated and also down 10 points of material it's hard okay this is July 18th fact whatsoever is a Bonafide scrub on July 18th he does not know how to play the game Tyler you gotta agree with me all right but then everything changed then everything changed this man after POG Champs ended and he got some wins in box Jams he beat Ginny he beat squeaks those names might not mean anything to you because you're 35 and don't watch Twitch that's fine um he beat a couple of the streamers he had a good run uh and and he decided that he was going to play serious chess he was going to play chess seriously and this continued for a while um this continued for a while he uh he he was actually pitted in a game against his own brother this happened at the pogchamps live final they weren't there but they played remotely this was a brother matchup we have uh e-rob uh playing against tyler1 these guys are uh are are you know you know that sibling rivalry and in this game Tyler was a different Beast all right he came in and at this point he started playing What's called the cow opening which is a terrible opening but not at the 1000 level I mean at the 1000 level you you could literally you could basically play anything and be fine and this opening is kind of good because it protects white it protects white skiing so you're never getting Scholars mated and tyler1 has made it work he likes this opening all right D4 and in this game he kind of played the cow he played what you're supposed to do in the cow opening now you know the cow is fine you can play the cow you can play the potato they're all terrible openings you could play the egg they're all terrible openings it's no disrespect on anybody and and I mean like this was already a major evolution in his game like he he was getting completely good positions from the opening and he was not making one move mistakes this was already like he was evolving as a player which is amazing this game was played uh August uh 18th one month after the after this already 30 days this this man played some openings that he likes gets positions in the beginning of the game that look relatively reasonable um maybe we should invite him to the chess kit Festival um so like everything was good and and I mean he he was doing a nice job and he was trading like he was simplifying the position down look at this trading off his opponent's pieces castling his opponent was taking space he was counter taking space and then he was rerouting his knight from a passive position to the other side of the board like this I mean look at this stuff this is amazing it's 20 moves have gone by and white has not blundered any pieces for a 500 that is very impressive now he starts attacking the queen side in a closed position you can either maneuver your pieces or your pawns and Tyler one is making Pawn trades to make progress in the position look at this trading down and now he's got the pawns going here this is amazing stuff Place Queen B1 G3 to kick the queen out and then just keeps advancing into his opponent's territory this is super super well-controlled game of chess King G2 to defend the night excellent stuff Rook to C1 look at this Knight to G5 hits the queen and now he trades pieces he's just trading pieces down and look at this this is amazing just amazing stuff Pawn to H4 unfortunately here a slight disaster happens because uh he forgets that the queen sees The Rook and he goes here it that's fine it's gonna happen it's gonna happen but his opponent misses it and then forgets that the queen now guards the road pre-moving this I guess and now tyler1 is winning tyler1 has played 40 moves of Chess in this game and has not made a mistake I mean this is incredible he could take the Rook he's just gonna promote he could give it a couple of checks he gives a check he misses that he can take the Rook but you know now this I mean this man has not made a single mistake this game he hasn't he hasn't made a single 561 playing like this now it's very simple you have to glue the king to one of these ranks promote the pawn and give a mate and that's exactly what he does look at this look at this is incredible check check not the checks that I would give but it's mating one now it's mating one on G7 or h8 okay he misses it now it's made in one on G7 with both Queens on C5 on D6 and he goes here and draws the game so this man played 52 good moves he played one bad move and he threw the entire game and that's life I gotta tell you you know you cannot get frustrated a lot of people get frustrated this man was up 25 points of material and just had a brain fart and that happens you know you've got to give checks you just when you're winning you you just have to make sure that you are giving checks okay you are giving checks otherwise something like this might happen and um it's devastating but he wasn't devastated and he grinded and I will remind you that from that point from August the 18th we could scroll all the way back I mean it's not even fully possible to see his game archive because look at how many games he plays every day I mean I can click like page seven and it will be like still September 10th I could page seven you can't even go back that far he just played non -stop this is totally crazy I've never seen something like this and he broke a thousand and I'm gonna show you his his last couple of games like these are real serious games now none of that pushing pawns one rank stuff this man is playing some real chess and his games are Scrappy and he is playing the cow in every game he is playing pon pon night night night night out and then Bishop and nobody knows how to stop this the position is of course slightly worse for black black is a little passive but who cares sometimes Tyler goes here and makes trades sometimes he goes here this man has a system he plays it with white he plays it with black and what can I say Pawn takes Pawn takes Knight D5 maybe that challenge to hiraku or whatever he called Hikaru and magnets carlston and me is serious all right he gets a position that looks like this from the opening and now let's see him play chess how does a how does a guy that learn chess basically two months ago play against one thousands okay Pawn to C6 Pawn to B5 not exactly uh you know the computer's preference but he's opening the position and there's going to be an attack Brewing over here Queen E4 attacks the pawn he defends the pawn his opponent plays Bishop D3 immediately hits the queen immediately taking advantage of the situation Rook to d8 puts pressure on the bishop and this move is very tricky the idea of this move is to get Tyler to take so that he gets mated but who is enabling the Checkmate the bishop black has one check in this position you always have to look for the more forcing move look at this bishop to H4 attacks the queen and you can't take a lot of people here with play Pawn to F6 tyler1 realizes what's worth more than a queen a king check that is genius for the 900 level now Rook takes and now he takes guys this is some gangster stuff I mean I'm telling you this is a guy this is a guy who is Unleashed 3 500 puzzles worth of tactics that is how you get better at chess now I'm not saying you need to do this within two months some of you you know are not able to dedicate that much time or attention to something like this but takes now Tyler takes the rook and he takes the Knight and now he takes the pawn with check simplifying into a winning end game this this is nuts okay that is crazy now white plays the best move which is Rook to D1 to try to get in over here now some this is still a pretty tough position he plays H5 gets his King some Breathing Room defends his Bishop loses a pawn but now it has to get out okay he's slowly finding his way out of the position he starts bringing his King all right there he is bringing the king nice brought the King Pawn to C5 he's gonna have to start bringing some other pieces out is he gonna figure out how to do this King D5 rookie four okay this should be five now White's Rook is kind of stuck check but now White's Rook is kind of stuck white tries to break out like this and here Tyler did essentially what's kind of like the um any of you watch Naruto Naruto versus uh you know the when Rock Lee drops his uh belt tyler1 loses his Bishop Rook to C6 check good fight by the players white doing a nice job pestering black not letting black break out of the position but by putting your Rook over here Tyler decides you know what run it down mid tyler1 is a League of Legends player at heart run it down mid run it down mid the king says I'm gonna go do the dirty work myself sometimes the mob boss has to take out the garbage that's just how it works the henchmen aren't doing a good job we're okay for king of three Rook C4 King G2 his opponent panics plays F5 he takes rookie three rookie for check root takes H4 rookie 4 check would have led to an end game that looks like this and here actually it's white who is winning because of the two Pawns but that's life it's the last it's the person who makes the last mistake Pawn to F4 instead of being greedy and taking this Pawn tyler1 runs it down mid Queen his opponent resigns and this is how tyler1 broke a thousand the most impressive moment in this game for me by far was the ability to spot Knight takes D3 check that is a sign of a player that has a future in the game of chess that is that I mean like chess's all pattern recognition and to be like my queen is hanging but instead of Defending it do I have any checks yeah with the Knight I said before this is the only check it's because my brain just threw away this move because it's obviously a bad move Knight takes D3 Knight takes H4 removing the attack on the checkmate incredible just awesome awesome stuff um what to say but there's more he wasn't done you thought he would just stop at a thousand there's more uh his games have been so crazy his games are like Wars I mean I'm telling you Bishop B4 check people really struggle to deal with this opening for white because there is nothing you can really do principles wise like when white plays the cow and gets a position that looks like this white is not really worse I mean white has technically wasted a little bit of time but like this is not going to get played at the candidates or something but you know Knight D2 okay he loses the pawn on C3 but he just plays Rook B1 and takes the file a pawn at this level is not really a pawn and now his opponent gives up the bishop and the bishop for The Rook which is a bad deal giving up two pieces for a rook is almost never good and now tyler1 has both Bishops for The Rook so he just has more pieces than his opponent who very promptly allows Queen takes B7 now this game has an apocalyptic vibe to it okay I want you to just watch because this is very funny what you're about to watch is super super funny um tyler1 in this position of course can Castle but he very correctly spots that his opponent gave up the B7 Pawn boom just a free Pawn now black plays Knight to D4 and you know with white here you should probably get the queen out but Tyler one takes the Knight and now very simple castles very simple he hasn't castled yet his Queen is still bothering and now white is going to try to mobilize the knights black gets the C Pawn out of the way tyler1 immediately attacks the queen queen to B4 hiru would be a very bad decision for white to trade Queens because it would allow black to have two connected past pawns marching down the board that is basically impossible to stop um so Queen C7 and at this point black realizes wait a minute I have pawns A5 now Tyler one here could be a scared little boy and start to you know go back and play defense this man when I tell you that this game has an apocalyptic Vibe just watch black marches down the board like it's you know uh Will Smith and I am Legend there is nobody else around on that side of the board so he just goes for a queen queen E5 Ponto A4 at this point tyler1 realizes wait a minute I'm gonna lose this game unless I act now like this Pawn is just gonna go so Queen F5 Knight to G5 tyler1 is going for a mate while this Pawn is marching if A2 he's gonna play Knight H5 if A1 Queen he takes and it's mate on the next move this is nuts this is completely nuts Knight G5 in this context is genius black probably has to get black does the wrong thing black goes here black loses the Knight not only does black lose the night now the promotion square is also covered this is really really really bad news for black but black sticks to the plan and now tyler1 is winning with Knight F5 has to be taken and this is Unstoppable mate that's a little bit difficult to see instead tyler1 goes here and now black super super clutch blocks the Queen by playing Queen to D4 this is really bad because if tyler1 trades the Queens here he's not going to stop the pawn Rook A1 Rook B8 Rook B1 and tyler1 is going to lose so instead tyler1 plays the top computer move E5 allowing the queen I th this is nuts he's not even losing he there are two Queens on the board if tyler1 takes then after Rook A1 he's gonna lose because he cannot stop this but this man does not panic and realizes his King is actually safe the queen is knocking on the door but tyler1 is still playing for a win and he takes the Rook black is slowly losing material black is unable to take with the Rook because the Rook needs to guard the pawn because check and mate so black can go Queen E5 or queen A8 black plays Queen A8 and now is losing again despite being up an entire second Queen because Knight F5 takes Queen H6 the same tactic but that's very tough to see so instead of that tyler1 sensing that he's hitting a brick wall decides H4 which is not the most accurate move but I gotta love the idea now the queen takes the pawn and Tyler realizes that now the queen no longer pins the pawn to the queen so he plays E6 tyler1 is knocking on the door and may I remind you that tyler1 looks like this you better not get him mad that smile is deceiving this man plays Pawn to E6 Pawn takes F7 is a massive threat black has to take now and make a drop the computer is now recommending that the players Shuffle the moves but instead of that the opponent plays Pawn to H6 Pawn takes F7 and tyler1 wins the game with Checkmate against two queens this is so crazy this is so crazy this man's games are unbelievable and he's so clutch counter-attacking the king while allowing a pawn to promote I've not this is I mean the two months of Chess y'all this man started playing chess seriously like 40 days ago 3 500 puzzles 1200 games in 30 days I've never seen something like this I've never seen something like this I never have people talk about speed runs and all this stuff this is beyond that this is an otherworldly level of play and I think I I found one more very fun game for you um that he played he had he had a game with the black pieces some sometimes you know sometimes he blunders in the opening sometimes he tries to implement the game plan and uh you know look look at this for example H4 he realizes wait a minute that's free he's right but it's very dangerous to take that pawn as you can see from the evaluation because now you've opened up this he's got to be very careful taking that pawn queen H5 now is winning for white battery and attack on H7 but tyler1 is a dog Bishop to F6 tyler1 is completely lost in this game but this man does not go down without a fight Rook to G1 he takes takes and plays Queen F6 it is plus eight all his opponent has to do is open the door open the door for the Rooks and the Bishops and it's over takes Bishop H7 King here Queen H5 like it's he's he's it's just here here you're gonna lose at some point rookie between H5 all over his opponent plays one inaccuracy Tyler takes and immediately launches his own counter-attack spotting that that is not checkmate Knight A4 and queen B2 is Checkmate what does his opponent do takes on G7 anyway spends three seconds out of his 8 minutes and 37 seconds plays this it's not made at all and here tyler1 has to either play King F6 and run or King h8 because this move loses Rook G1 check Bishop G7 check Bishop anywhere on this diagonal check here Bishop G7 and any of these moves is made not that one one two three four five six but instead of that his opponent takes the Rook now it's time for tyler1 to fight back F6 grabs the bishop he's got no business at all winning this position but he goes here and this move threatens the pawn and people are reactive by Nature so his opponent goes oh my Pawn is hanging I gotta defend it tyler1 doesn't need a second chance and his conversion here clinical E5 chop chop chop s the pawns stops that pawn as well takes that pawn and now he just goes down he doesn't even care about losing the bishop because he has so many extra pawns rookie four Bishop G okay loses the we're gonna pretend that didn't happen King F6 King E5 doesn't take the Rook because he doesn't need it D5 Bishop F5 check and his opponent resigns because he's going to lose the Rook I'm not sure Tyler won't saw that for sure his games are so wild like you have got to bury this man into the ground to beat him because he's winning these absurd back and forth games but they're they make sense like they make sense he's defending well he's fighting back from unpleasant positions and he's taking his chances when presented this is one of the most insane stories I've I'm telling you that I have ever seen this man in 40 days has played over 1200 games of chess that is that's unheard of that is unheard of I kudos to him now get out of here
