I think at this point large-scale reliable data is really important but also important are the human stories and something that caught my eye was the day in life of an emergency room doctor Craig Spencer that he revealed in a series of tweets thank you everyone for the incredible messages of support and encouragement many of you asked what it was like in the emergency room right now I want to share a bit with you a day in the life of an emergency room doc a brief dispatch from the cove 819 frontline wake up at 6:30 a.m. priority is making a big pot of coffee for the whole day because the place by the hospital is closed the Starbucks - it's all closed on the walk it feels like Sunday nobody's out might be the freezing rain or it's early regardless that's good walk in for the 9:00 a.m. shift immediately struck by how the calm of the early morning city streets is immediately transformed the bright fluorescent lights of the emergency room reflect off everybody's protective goggles there's a cacophony of coughing you stop masks up walk in you sign out from the previous team but nearly every patient is the same young and old cough shortness of breath fever they're really worried about one patient very short of breath on the maximum amount of oxygen we can give but still breathing fast you immediately assess this patient it's clear what this is what needs to happen you have a long and honest discussion with the patient and family over the phone it's best to put her on life support now before things get much worse you're getting set up for that but you're notified of another really sick patient coming in you rush over they're also extremely sick vomiting they need to be put on life support as well you bring them back to patients and rooms right next to each other both getting a breathing tube it's not even 10:00 a.m. yet for the rest of your shift nearly every hour you get paged stat notification very sick patient short of breath fever oxygen 88% stat notification low blood pressure short of breath low oxygen stat notification low oxygen can't breathe fever all day sometime in the afternoon you recognize you haven't drank any water you're afraid to take off the mask it's the only thing that protects you surely you can last a little longer in West Africa during Ebola you spent hours in a hot suit without water one more patient but late afternoon you need to eat restaurant across the street is closed right everything is closed but thankfully the hospital cafeteria is open you grab something wash your hands twice cautiously take off your mask and eat as fast as you can go back mask up walk in nearly everyone you see today is the same we assume everyone is covered 19 we wear gowns goggles and masks at every encounter all day it's the only way to be safe where did all the heart attacks and appendicitis patients go it's all kovat your shift ends you sign out to the uncoming team it's all kovat 19 or the past week we've all learned the signs he goes on to list the signs one of which is little oxygen you share concerns and friends throughout the city without personal protective equipment hospitals running out of ventilators before you leave you wipe everything down your phone your badge your wallet your coffee mug all of it drown it in Bleach everything in the bag take no chances sure you got it all wipe it down again can't be too careful you walk and take off your mask if you'll make it and exposed it's still raining but you want to walk home feel safer than the subway or bus bus you need to decompress the streets are empty this feels nothing like what is happening inside maybe people don't know you get home you strip in the hallway it's okay your neighbors know what you do everything in a bag your wife tries to keep your toddler away but she hasn't seen you in days so it's really hard run to the shower rinse it all away never happier time for family you reflect on the fact that it's really hard to understand how bad this is and how bad is going to be if all you see are empty streets hospitals and nearing capacity we're running out of ventilators ambulance sirens don't stop everyone we see today was infected a week ago or more the numbers will undoubtedly skyrocket overnight as they have every night the past few days more will come to the emergency room more will be stat notifications more will be put on a ventilator we were too late to stop the virus full stop but we can slow its spread the virus can't infect those it never meets stay inside social distancing is the only thing that will save us now you might hear people say it isn't real it is you might hear people say it isn't bad it is you might hear people say it can't take you down it can I survived Ebola I fear Kovan 19 do your part stay home stay safe and every day I'll come to work for you this is a moving accounting through a series of tweets by an emergency room doctor on the very front lines of fighting Cove 819 without question the best thing we could do now is stay home while people like Craig Spencer doctors nurses health care workers service workers support us and treat the people who are sick and really importantly as we get more and more reliable data this isn't the time to panic this is the time to take optimal action given that we're operating under a huge amount of uncertainty the two things we need to do is the most important is to save lives and the second is collect good reliable data before we can reopen the economy we have to get good data to understand the spread of the virus in order to be able to control it and all the while treating people who are sick without overwhelming the resources of our medical system stay safe out there stay informed stay strong we'll be this thing I love you all you
