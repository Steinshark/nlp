this is the second in a Trilogy of videos about really big numbers and the notorious 666 it should make sense on its own but you can see links to all of them down in the description oh God is this is going to test my Bible knowledge aren't you the Goliath was I can't remember that oh his tribe I can't remember his tribe he fought David didn't he he's the giant he fought David and Goliath yeah of course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so David did the the sling yeah I think you must you must have rocked up to church more than me I've been to the place that battle happened the Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side with a valley between them so here is a rock from the Eli Valley right here in my hand all right there you go yeah that's the yeah okay yeah Goliath that's of course that's who Goliath is yeah so why are we being mean about I mean he doesn't seem as bad as the anyway we we anyway Goliath numbers what's a Goliath number yeah okay so now we're still looking at 2 to the end but now we're not looking for 666 we're looking for 66 6 666's so we're looking for 666 yeah and then another 666 and so on oh okay so we're looking for that combination which has 666 666s in a row oh okay so the number of digits it must have is 3 * 66 yeah exactly exactly but there's not so 666 666s 1998 yes it's 1998 uh sixes in a row but it's 666 666 right that's what it is okay so these numbers which contain this are called gath numbers right they have a symbol okay so the smallest Goliath number has a symbol like that okay do we know any Goliath numbers and it has to be a a two to the N it can't it has to be a two to the N it has to contain this monster here right so what's the first Goliath number we don't know there's not been one found we have found a Goliath number this is a Goliath number let me show you this is the smallest known Goliath this so this is two to the you can say it's 2 to the K where K is this absolute monster so that's the power that's the power not the number that's not the number the number itself is just going to be massive right so this is the smallest known Goliath it's probably not the smallest seems to be the thinking but we don't know the smallest if that's not the smallest and they were searching for the smallest what made them choose that n and not a smaller n there's some sort of algorithm that this this uh particular mathematician found to try to find them and and this one um and this one gets was the smallest one that they could find but there's no proof for even suggestion that this is the smallest actually right I'd love to see the expansion to see where the Goliath appears I mean there's no I can't put it into edit it's just too big yeah it's too big um so obviously I tried I thinking oh you know this was written 10 years ago or something I'm going to whack it into a computer no no no I couldn't find one um I mean my computer just get crashed so yeah I mean it's a challenge I think what is what is the smallest one it's not known and this one exists but it's huge but you know so so wow these are the goliaths how much would you like to be the person to find the smallest Goliath would that mean anything to you or would you think you're an idiot or would you like take some pride in it so so when I so when I was prepping for this video I got a bit talking I'm going to find this and I'm like tell I'm going to tell you find and then I would have if I'd found it I would have come swaggering in thinking look at me like you know and I said Bray I filed it I expected you to be very impressed I would have been and but I didn't find it so sad sadly um yeah so those are Goliath numbers wow so a bit of a mystery there so we're not stopping we're not stopping no we're not sto we're just getting started we're just getting started there are more of these kind of apocalyptic 6660 type numbers that that pickover likes to play with another one is Legions number okay so Legions the legions of demons I think or whatever it is there's something like that Legions sounds bad right of Roman Legions I don't think it's Roman Legions but it probably comes from that I think it's I think it's these kind of Legions of demonic entities that you know so the what is the legion number well the legion number has a symbol as well I think it's kind of like this and it's 666 to the 666 okay M uh you can write this number out out it's not particularly uh complicated this number is bigger than a Google it's not particularly exciting I don't think I couldn't really find anything particularly exciting about it but you can start to ramp it up a little bit so there's another number which which pick over looks like so this he says this is legion's number but it's legion's number of the first kind then he introduces Legions number of the second kind okay so so what is this well this is kind of you build it like this so you have the second kind so you have two of these guys right and this is 66 6 factorial to the 666 factorial okay this is getting silly now this is getting a bit silly we haven't start yet really okay this is big yeah okay this is bigger well we'll see how big it is in a minute because we want to think about how big it is because there's another number which is Big that they introduce which is the Leviathan number again sea monster scary um this has a symbol as well it's got I love these symbols it symbol is like a little Hoy thing a little Hoy thing all right I didn't mean it that way right okay and this is this is uh 10 to the 666 uh factorial okay so the these are both clearly big numbers right which is bigger yes which one is bigger what you think my instinct was that that was going to be bigger yeah yeah yeah and it is it is bigger it is bigger but but you can ask how big it is how would you figure out how big it is okay well one thing you can ask is how many digits do you think it's got the way you would do that you you take a logarithm with respect to base 10 okay because you know you think of something like a you know 10^ the two right it's it's a you take lot that's 100 okay so that's by taking the logarithm you get two and and that's one off the number of digits tells you number of zeros so so taking a logarithm tells you gives you an estimate for the size of the number so if you do the base 10 log of this guy this is the phase two uh the legions number in second kind second kind Legion it's not too difficult to calculate this is this is you use the sort of rules of logs to to do it and you can get you get 666 factorial log 10 of 666 factorial your computer can handle that that's not difficult at all approximately equal to 1.6 * 10 to the 5 96 so that gives you a flavor for how many digits this has got right is of order this number of digits it's clearly a very big number it's clearly bigger than a Google Plex okay this is bigger than a Google Plex which we'll come back to in a minute actually okay what about this guy how big is this well this one's harder to to to we want to take its log right but this one's you can't it's not as easy as this one the calculation is harder you have to use something called Sterlings approximation so Sterlings approximation tells us how to calculate factorials for uh for for big numbers so you've got got n factorial and N is a big number Sterling's approximation tells us that this goes like 2 pi n n/ e to the N now this is this approximation is due to a guy called James Sterling who's a mathematician from the uh you born in the 17th century Scottish mathematician now at this point Tony goes on bit of a tangent about Sterling I've chopped that out but you can see the clip over on number file two so basically you know you use this approximation you approximate this number using this formula this is approximately 6.65 56 I don't know there's more digits uh times 10^ the 668 digits long so it's somewhat smaller it's a lot smaller it's still this this number of digits is still larger than a Google so this is this number this Leviathan number so this is the Leviathan this is the legion number the second kind they're both bigger than a Google Plex now Brady do you remember when we did about a Google Plex one of the things we said was that in a a university that was a Google Plex meters across then you would get doel ganders yeah so we can ask the question what if you had a number a universe that it was a Google not a Google Plex a leviathan meters across or a legion to the second kind meters across or plank lengths across whatever you know units you want you know what is that kind of contain well I reckon if the devil exists and he's around the size of of of a human then there will be more than one one devil in such a universe there would be multiple copies of it yeah just by the same rationale as we had for the um the number of ways in which you can arrange that that sort of you know devil siiz region of space it has to you have to have repetitions okay so there we are all right let's talk about super leviathans now this is my own definition now okay okay H so so pickover does have a definition for super Lans but I thought it was totally unsatisfactory so I'm having my own one okay so so definition of super Lans well remember what the what the the Leviathan was it was 10^ the 666 factorial that was the Leviathan okay the Horny number the Horny number yeah yeah so what's the super Leviathan well instead of using a factorial let's use a super factorial so super factorial is where you have it's sometimes done with a dollar sign and it's this basically and it's m factorial to the m factorial d d keep going with M factorials and there should be n factorial of these guys so it's m factorial to the m factorial to the m factorial to the m factorial and there's M factorial in this Tower so you can imagine if you if you did 10^ 666 super 666 super factorial that's 10^ the 666 factorial to the 10666 factorial loads of these bad boys and in fact there 10 to the 666 factorial of them so you've got Leviathan to the Leviathan to the Leviathan to the Leviathan to the Leviathan to Leviathan and you've got a leviathan of them that's just crazy you might remember when we did um double arrow notation in graes number for those that know you can write this in double arrow notation it would just be n factorial Double Arrow and factorial but anyway um but this is obviously another scale big it's going to take you Way Beyond any numbers you could imagine in the universe in the apocalypse you know Way Beyond panker occurrences everything this is just silly big but this is still going to be small compared to Graham's number that's what everyone was asking this is going to be tiny compared to it's nothing so even this super Leviathan doesn't touch doesn't touch gra doesn't touch the sides doesn't touch the there's a third in this Trilogy of apocalyptic videos it deals withe and Fibonacci numbers links are in all the usual places the last digit you can actually get the last I think there's a list of the last 500 digits you can because it turns out you take a big enough power of three uh the last digits you know are very predictable but the first digit I don't know and uh it's your number what do you want it to the first digit to be uh well in binary it's one so there you go so we have a which is a Google Plex Meers across then that's very big and if you actually traveled far enough in that Universe you would start to see repetitions you would start to see exact copies of yourself
