let's get started so today I'm here to talk about like the hiring offer of meeting C++ right um so hello to everyone in the chat and on LinkedIn um and later on YouTube so are you hiring for C++ is the question right this is also the target audience kind of defined with that um let me go into my slides and then we can start so I am looking for employers for the job fair in two weeks and two weeks actually we will be sitting here in hubo and having the job fair live and I would like to announce which employers are at the job fair but that's kind of yeah um this is not the case at the moment I'm still looking for employers to join and I see that some some companies may be interested from what I see uh but I have not um yet seen signups from companies so I guess the next two weeks will be where this happens so this has often be the case this is just normal um but if you are hiring right now and you're looking for a good way to connect to the C++ Community um the meeting C plus online job fair is the perfect place for you to be to present your company and on the first day we're going to be at 300 p.m. uh Berlin time middle European Time 4 3 hours live and on the second day we'll be at 8:00 P.M live for again two to three hours um to cover kind of you know all time zones um and we've been doing this now for quite some time since 201 21 um and last year's result I recently posted to the blog uh 225 candidates actually submitted unique candidates submitted over the CV sharing form for meeting C++ last year into this um and there's some data on it which I'll you know present later in this um and for years I've been hearing that c steps are hard to find but one thing I can say this has changed in 2023 there's lot less interest in hiring now and there's seems to be mostly um companies still looking but they're looking with less effort and more in the traditional ways what they've you know do for other things and um more like where they like look for all their jobs they also get their C++ fix but they're not doing something extra um and for some companies that might be the right strategy but I think there's some companies out there which actually should do something extra and should be presented like a job fair for C++ to specifically be able to you know get a feeling what deaths are on the market and what people you can talk to for C++ um and to kind of you know see how things are going in this direction um I did a survey and these are from last year from April and August um and the question basically is your employer is currently or hiring for C++ not hiring for C++ and letting C++ folks go and um there we see it's like last year's numbers um it seemed to be getting a bit better in um August than it was in April last year and if I look at the numbers of this year um it's like not as good as in April last year and I wonder kind of is this like a seasonal thing and kind of you have to get a bit more data on it and I'm looking forward to have this question probably uh be again a survey in April to see if that changes um but for the moment we seem to have like still majority of companies are hiring um but it's not over 50% and a third of companies is roughly not hiring and 20% um are still you know downsizing and restructuring um and I also do ask this question on LinkedIn so April August um we see that's like of course on LinkedIn there's always a bit more hiring and firing um and that's the general Trend and if you look at this year um it's very close to what uh Twitter had in is also on LinkedIn this time so these are very close much closer than than they were in the past year and so generally um yeah about 47% are currently hiring not hiring is like about a third and about 20% um is right now in the way that you know there's there's various reasons for the the amount of people being let go um financing has become a lot harder for startups a lot of startups uh go down or just you know structure and have to you know uh conserve their trying trying to you know not not end the startup but keep going so they they set people free um we've had the big hiring and firing spree especially uh the the big tech companies hired a lot of people to basically stock them and to not make them available to the market and the competition and that ended last year and a lot of those people were set free and um there is not yet like the that the market has all you know um bounced back and rehired those people um that's my impression right now um so if you're looking for C++ developers now is the time to really hire very good talent um and let me quickly read chat I see a lot of people in the chat thank you for coming and um yeah so if you have any questions just post it into theat um but I think I will continue in a second with a talk and then um present mostly on the data I have from last year all right let's carry on [Music] so my offer from meeting C++ is through the online User Group which was reaction to the pandemic and this exists now for um soon as four years and from the beginning I thought something like a jop fair would make sense and so um the whole concept was making really really a good introduction in 2021 and since then we've hosted like a few events of that like four to five events per year um this year I can host one in March and in April usually April is bad because of Easter but Easter is like right on the border of March and April this year so that in late April we have uh Long Way lead before uh people are returning from the holidays and going into holidays again after April right May is big uh holiday time in Germany and June and and some other months anyways so um the plan to run those drop fairs is March April late September maybe beginning of October and then end of November to close the year um and that has played out fairly well in the recent uh years um um the concept itself is you have your table and people join it and you talk about your company what you do with C++ what your open positions are what you think about candidates what they should learn or what they should have etc etc and on the other hand companies are sitting on their tables and candidates join them on their table and candidates of course also ask the same questions like you know what do you do with C++ um how do you hire what do you hire and Etc and if it's a match then an interview um is not at the event okay just want to clarify this this is not an interview event it's more like a fair where people come and go and you get to meet a lot of people um again the times in the afternoon for Europe and the first day 3:00 and 8:00 in the evening on the second day uh that's a to cover the time zones better and B to um the evening job fair is not as popular in Europe with the recruiters because they like to you know uh attend in working hours but when we have companies able to staff that in the evening uh in Europe and the European companies or American companies or you know other companies from time that makes sense um we do have very very interesting folks come also in the evening um when they are of work because they can't come during work so this is a very good uh thing and then there is the CV sharing form which captures all those folks and these are the majority in here which are not able to come to either date right there's always like doesn't matter how many job fairs you make uh you never capture the whole audience with it so they are um captured through the CV sharing form they can just just you know um upload their CV and that's one of the things we're going to talk about um but let's talk a bit more about the event so the event starts with a kickoff where I you know talk to the event and Linkedin to get a bit more folks into the event um because those uh can also be quite interesting like people joining seeing it by random chance and um having an interview and getting a job that's always a good uh story too and so um the other goal behind it is just simply to to explain the event to the the audience and get a better retention to come to the Louch um and if you're hiring and you want your own live stream like only the audience should like only be on company X of your y company y um of your choosing then and you want to cover like what you do you maybe you're tra company maybe you're an automotive company maybe you're an embedded company and you want to specialize on that and say this is the topic of the stream um then I I can do your own live stream and you also can sponsor a user group meeting um which then also is online um but let's talk a bit more more about the series sharing form it's always online and the job fair sponsorship gives you six months of listing um so even when you do not find uh your candidates during the job fair um you still get a lot of companies to have receive you know candidates and so your chance is to uh get them within the next month um and this is very successful this has helped a lot of companies hire very good people um this is how the first page of the form looks um it allows candidates to share their CV with sponsors and also to enter an optional six months listing um I I do have a candidate listing which is visible to uh the sponsors of the event and so if you're joining the event you automatically have like right now it's 76 uh folks which have their CVS listed there for six months and of course after six months so they drop out this number kind of you know bounces often up up and down every day a little bit um and so this great a light profile of where they're coming from where they want to work how they want to work their C++ skills field of work and the years of experience and let's have a bit of a look into that um for the uh candidate listing I have this overview of regions where we see that um the submissions currently uh come from Europe and Asia mostly a little bit of North America a little bit of Africa and a little bit of South America um but this changes all the time and Europe and Asia just we have the biggest reach um and also just North American companies have not that often joined so that's not as popular and not as well known in this time zone um these are the skills from those candidates and this is basically to tell you know the recruiter and also to give us a bit of data on what you're kind of you looking for um to you know have employers know as your skill set um so generally C++ 14 lunux 11 17 modern C++ object orientation and cmake are the top seven um the ordering is uh changing and there's some trends for a very long time it was C++ 11 on top now it is mostly Linux if I um go into the other data we'll see that and here it's now 14 but it's just you know so small a margin um and then you have a lot of other skills where people are you know skilled in and I also do ask like what's your background in the industry which Fields have you worked in um here the big change now is for me that embedded is on top and usually for the last years this has always been desktop um I think it has something to do with Automotive making it to the third place because Automotive deaths are also embedded deaths mostly um and then there's Finance industry robotics image processing and so on you know it's a big mix of backgrounds and people uh Science University of course uh covers of the education um some people work for finance some people work for HPC and so on um and when we look at the data for 2023 225 candidates from 52 countries and country-wise I do have a bit of a chick n egg problem when I do not have employers from a country I have less candidates and if I can advertise like for a certain country and employer it usually helps us retention from country um first place here for countries has always been India um and Germany and United States usually are close to you know the second or third um and then comes just the selection of countries from Asia and Europe and it always kind of differentiates um how the how you know how this mix comes together uh Pakistan Iran turkey Brazil Netherlands and Poland are there currently like in the leading group and the next and this year will be again a bit different this is kind of you know fluctuating um the skills for last year um and here it's again it's like the the top seven this time the ordering is Linux C++ 11 14 17 cake object orientation and modern C++ um and if we go around 90 um folks choosing something that is like 50% um so make is above that boost cute and functional programming is around it and um yeah CS 20 is not there yet but I guess within this year could rise to it becomes more popular also becomes more available with compilers you know going down the chain of deployment uh slowly um and then there's just the specialities and package managers unfortunately are still rather a rare Choice um fields of work for last year also it's as I said desktop is on the first place embedded and Automotive now are second and third and if Automotive stays around like that then probably embedded will become the first place uh and server Finance other image processing and so on you know um and one thing I'm wondering is like AI is not like really a space where top C++ C++ is a top lead but it plays such a role in in our future I guess that um we'll see like either like if the high you know resultes into nothingness and we all find out that uh AI is not yet ready for the market um as you know certain things are looking in that way or if we're getting used to using assistance which are Ai and Cloud powered um so that's like something where I look into for this year is like this this is like a field where which finds more people with a background in in our community or not um and I wanted a way to compare those numbers with the overall community and this is still work in progress but I do actually have the perfect tool for this um with the meeting c community survey which is a survey tool and just as a k this is a different data set and context different matter so take this with a grain of salt but interestingly at least currently the data is fairly similar um if we take a look here at the C++ skills in the community um we see that 114 and 17 C++ standards is on top it's not very surprising um Linux is then was more than C++ on the fourth and fifth place and C is already like yeah it's not it's then cmake Linux cmake and then mod C++ uh the top six hold up from the top seven we have object orientation and that does not hold up um and I feel like this is makes a difference when people are wanting to be hired then object orientation is more important than when with a general Community uh interestingly more people have chosen C plus 98 which is around 200 and um object orientation should be like at 185 I'd say maybe 180 [Music] um and if you generally look at the top five skills it's sorted a little bit different um I think this is a reflection on that people in a job search are more comfort comtable to um choose something they're really comfortable with and C++ 17 might be for some still to new or they want to or they assume that someone who uses C++ 17 also uses 14 and 11 and that is covered for them um which you know that that's like I think the the main difference between those data sources is that people employ employ different strategies and have a different um impression of what is important for them to choose in this form and for the job search form definitely it's also that um we do have uh people maximize that so that they choose a lot of things they know about like what I'm interested in and other people like what I'm really good in and they're like just just a few ones just just three or five and others to like a lot um which might also reflect on your career status and um so I don't I don't want to limit this to to five or tell people how much they should choose um but this makes a difference um fields of work is very similar um desktop is on top closely followed by embedded big difference is that third number here is industry and then it's Automotive image processing and server which are the force Place shared together and then everyone else um AI is like more like in the not so often chosen ranks here interestingly um so this could be an interesting difference to to job Searchers maybe maybe that becomes important for them to choose AI in the future um because not not of not all of those will you know be uh chosen for truth um but we'll see um and if you look at and compare these we see that uh industry is is a big difference but it's not really mattering that much and then Automotive image processing server um but I think this is also like really a reflection on what companies we have at the job fair um if we have a lot of gaming companies we have more gaming deaths coming to the job fair and hence this will be stronger in the data um and otherwise it will not be as strong in the data of course and same for finance if we don't have finance companies Finance field will not show up as strong and then maybe we had companies with a lot of embedded background in the past and so embedded has become stronger right now um I'm also asking for years of experience and here kind of like these are always the same looking uh graphs um roughly like 2/3 60% until 10 years like people which are either Juniors or just have become seniors and then um for last year this goes up to 33 years in the industry which is like really senior right um and so that's something that is like yeah just interesting to see that there's a lot of folks which are joining the industry and they're looking for their first or second job and then all the other folks which just you know are looking for their next gig um and this basically is a CV sharing form um it allows candidates to share a light profile and then this gets shared with employers which sponsor the event um and on the second uh step of this of course is for the candidate to select the companies they want to share with okay um I I want to stress that that um as a company as an employer you're attending but you're only receiving CVS from candidates that are actually interested in you right um candidates have the choice to also be listed in the candidate listing though you can look into the candidate listing and um look if there's candidates which you find find interesting as an employer but uh the active notification that an candidate has chosen you is always the meaning that they've you know clicked the box for your company and in this step also they upload the CV in the resume and not everyone but most people added General cover letter and if you look at the general data of the history now um last year we had was 100 candidates in March submitting um a record four companies attending back then um and then kind of the interest in hiring during summer naturally uh wi away so last year we probably had the last drop fair in June until companies really demand this again uh because just companies seem not to be interested to attend these events in Holiday times um September we had Linda which is still in in the form great company great employer um but we had from from the execution it was like a late sign up so it was a bit difficult this is the new low um and then uh this went up again and then still you know got all the those candidates from the second uh meeting which was like 69 so the the average of 60 candidates with each event still troop and um if you join one job fair as a company you will also like you know receive more candidates after you're attending and mostly when we do like for a year um that means you're getting the candidates from the next job fair too and as I mentioned you know uh attending companies and early sign up influences how many candidates are coming and what kind of of candidates are attracted the event consists out of sponsored tables where companies you know sent their staff to and they have their logos listed with a link to their recruiting Platforms in the CV resume sharing form on the website in the job section uh I can introduce them in the live streaming they have access to the recruiting tooling I'll talk about that in a minute and the me to advertise with your logo to say hey company ha why is cominging and you probably want to come and you know meet them um and it drives and guides the tooling um I do have fre tables which are basically just letting you have a table at the event as an employer um you're listed below the sponsor tables it's mainly for getting a feel for the event format I kind of have to limit it to two visits um you get a smaller table and um this is for also like some some some people want to join and then um they don't get the funds soon enough it's like two weeks now and in some companies it takes like four weeks to acquire something like that and and building um so either then join the next job fa join this one and then use the budget to uh join the next one too and quickly explaining what a table is this is a virtual lounge and people sit on a virtual table with eight four or two seats everyone is able to join by clicking on a seat once two folks sit a meeting starts and meetings um kind of have their own UI so when you once you in an in an meeting you will not see the lunch again but everyone from the outside is still able to join your meeting um as long as there's a free seat on your table um these meetings are limited by one hour which is a feature by hubido and then basically candy dates should go to the next table or you know they're free to leave your table if they're not interested anyways um after the amount of time they spend there that's up to them um and recruiters then simply should join the table again the recruiting tooling is basic overview which candidates have submitted to you you can read their message open their CV which you also received pre email um you get the statistics I showed you for your company specifically so this probably helps you with internal presentations and helps you to to say this is uh what we spent the money on and so many candidates we had skills they had and this can be very interesting data um for your teams I do have a search form because uh we do have a lot of candidates admitting the one event had 100 candidates submit and that can be too much to keep an overview and maybe you have multiple roles maybe you want to have you know you have this one rooll was cute and then you want to search for a candidate in your submissions that knows cute and um maybe you know you also have some other interface where you need to have the Legacy interface where you need to have Boost or job where you need boost on the server or MFC in the Legacy and so on you can just choose the profile if there's like that the need and there's also a text search to cover um the cover letters and the cover letters kind of also have this this um data pasted into it um so you can search for that also in the text search um and that basically is a job fair it's a longtime project we're doing it now for three plus years it's a success and but it needs really and it hangs on the employer support from companies and early stups help a lot more for the community to know who is coming to the event and we always learn with States um how to deal with it and how to um improve the event and let me quickly read chat I see there's some questions here's an interesting question um is there some data indicating continents as well as Industries like fintech Automotive that hire more C++ Engineers um as most of my candidates come from Asia and Europe I can uh kind of generate graphs for that and I have done that in the past um but that then gets a rather long talk and so I skip that this time but yes I I do have the data on the regions and I can basically generate a graph uh of skills by region for example I can do that um I do only have candidate data I do not know what companies and Industry on specific continents or countries are looking for ah this is also a very good question um and I I agree with that that um there is of course this whole developer setup and um usability with code that comes and yeah that's actually good I I think I would like to also have this like in the skills covered but yeah this is like how to express it how to find a name for this um and so you know and I I understand that you know that you're mostly missing an candidate is an interest and experience and meta aspects of the software development life cycle um how to build stable yet extensible interfaces apis and well maintainable code and um I think this is like really difficult to to to cover in in such a form um but that's of course something you can um ask for and also kind of see like if um yeah let me generally let me let me think about on how to integrate it in the skills I probably get around it but right now I yeah I I agree with it that it would be interesting to know if people also have experience with st Ops and API design and maybe that's already like two good keywords to add to um the skill set um which helps people find out more on the candidates they have in front um and with that let me continue back to the slides um I quickly want to go through the submission model candidates user form to choose the employers and then this creates an application State um employers also can basically use the filter search to create an application State um I do not have like a direct back channel to the candidates because while I do have an internal state for candidates which can which you know can be applied from the employer s uh my experience in the last year is or last years is that this is not really used um and I don't want to Force like my tooling on companies uh companies have their own internal setup and they usually are very happy when they receive uh the candidate email with uh the CV attached that's fair game for most companies uh some companies have a different setup that is basically that you see the link to their portal to submit it there which is an extra step and the way they receive candidates but they of course will uh filter out those candidates that are not as much interested to submit to company Y and the Y portal and you know create an account there and do all the things that you need to do to submit for that company um and that is completely their choice that is something uh which came as feedback from employers and I've implemented it and that's covered but um and also I had the case that like one company currently is not listed because they fill their positions and they don't want to be listed if they don't have positions which is understandable um and this CV in submission form basically creates a profile which covers the skills the field of work the region or just continents I also collect the the country where you're from but I don't filter on that that would be a bit of an Overkill um and the years of experience and companies May filter or search on these and the filter is actually um you can set this also as a visibility filter like your company is using cute and you do not want to see or be visible to candidates that do not use cute um you can set that cute is mandatory you can choose a range of things which uh then are either all mandatory or partly mandatory um and um like for example if you want are are specifically looking for um candidates with an experience in AP design API design or something um that would be a good uh feedback which we just got um thank you for that um where you could set a filter on and then you only get candidates which are uh choosing this as a skill um but of course the the downside of that is that some companies overdo this and then wonder why they do not receive any CVS right because not everyone chooses this and some candidates will be rather um critical of choosing SS of skill which is the down the downside of having um like too many skills or skills which are more like uh in the ex like you know maybe something would make sense in that to filter for that but then you might end up with having less candidates for stuff which is not like very common and for the community we do get a better hiring um we get less uh use of recruiters and head hunters uh from agencies which just you know spam everyone with drop offers which right now is not so much the case but I guess it's still happening um and I do get the funding which I need to to run the event right this is not my free time it's not a hobby um and I I try to integrate employer with this event into the platform Edge I have build over the last more than 10 years now and it's still my goal and um LinkedIn just last uh week I two sus ago LinkedIn uh went over the 40,000 um so meaning C++ is growing a lot still and there's a lot of C++ deaths out there and from from the numbers we saw that right now about 47% of the deaths I can reach are working for an employer which has currently open positions so I hope that some of them will be with us in two weeks to join the job fair and we have fun for three hours and conversations about jobs C++ and often during those talks uh a lot of tables evolve by the way around topics like API design uh how do you use certain features uh how do you um you know keep your code maintainable and Par programming and other things um but it's completely up to the companies what they do on the table so sometimes you have devs talking to Deaths sometimes it's recruiters talking uh with STS and so it's completely a different experience from table to table often and with that thank you for listening um I'll be looking again in the chat if you have any questions also for YouTube If you have any questions just put it in the chat in the comments there's not chat on YouTube um and if you have you know contact me on LinkedIn write me an email job fair. med.com leads to the website where you can sign up as an employer and March 12th and 13th are the dates for the job fair and so if there's any more questions um I happily can answer them there's a comment on languages you speak as in German English or something um yes um but I for now I don't want to put that into the tooling because it's just too much and um I think that for most companies that are hiring they also have english- speaking teams or some of the German companies have chosen to you know to um restrict their reach to Europe which I also understand smaller companies hiring here might just only be visible for European candidates if you see this after we have been live um I can still answer the questions in the comments and I usually do also um there will be YouTube this will be on YouTube probably by tomorrow tomorrow and um yeah send me a message on LinkedIn contact me if you're an employer um that is also a good thing because that's like you know one of the main goals right now is again to find companies which join this event and some companies might join it again that has actually happened that we had multiple companies join it over the years for a few times so we'll see what happens and with that I hope to see you in two weeks at the meeting C+ plus online job fair
