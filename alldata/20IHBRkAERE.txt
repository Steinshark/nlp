hey guys i'm ready for the land party with a mouse and keyboard what a weirdo [Laughter] what are you thinking dude you're crazy man oh thank god it's only a dream yup the 90s were a wild time apple nearly went bankrupt jenko jeans were cool and games like doom and quake were taking the world by hellstorm but many folks struggled to adapt to first person control schemes so clever designers thought could there be a better way and came up with these the thrustmaster fragmaster and the microsoft sidewinder dual strike both of them claim to give you a better experience than a mouse and keyboard so what happened to them have we been missing out all this time or did we narrowly avoid a dark alternate timeline where the mouse and keyboard went extinct and linus didn't tell the audience about his sponsor hetzner hetzner offers high performance cloud servers for a great price with their u.s locations in ashburton virginia you can deploy load balancers block storage and more in just a few seconds use code ltt 22 for 20 off at the link below which do you want to start with i want to start with the fragmaster okay sweet this one we got used off of ebay um and you can kind of tell the packaging's a little beat up i would expect anything this old to be i think you might want to explore the packaging before you get inside because there is some pretty funny stuff on it i think i do master any move like the popular circle strafe maneuver is that considered a maneuver anymore i think we just call it kiting the side strafe i'm sorry i didn't see this evade incoming rockets by sliding left and right while attacking forward to get the frag mega hertz mode increase your fps frag a possessive frags per second use it as a regular four axis joystick or select the exclusive mega hertz mode and change your up down left right movement to ultra fast nose control that's gonna be terrible instead of a simple x y which by the way is also any direction we've got two rotational axes you ready david yes is your body ready though it never was for the fragmaster the driver cd it looks like a game i love this branding windows 95 and 98 you know something a lot of people don't realize especially you younger folks is that in the early fps gaming days there wasn't really a standard control scheme it wasn't just wasd and mouse like we have today or asdf or whatever it's still pretty standard there was all kinds of stuff like i remember sitting and trying to play an early unreal tournament game on my friend's computer because i didn't have a good computer at the time and in order to look up and down you actually used keyboard buttons okay this wow couple problems right out of the gate okay i see the mouse-like movement here right it's a joystick obviously like thrustmaster joystick company so basically they took a joystick right and then they put this on it so here's how you kind of move but you'd be stuck with more like a like a like a scrolling action versus uh like being able to move it faster in order to control how far you're going and how quickly you're doing it problem number two is as soon as you do any of this it starts to it starts to go the other way like there's kind of a counter lever this is going to be awful lots of buttons credit for that you've got two paddles on the back on each side okay then you've got three on the front rip the three button controller layout by the way sega genesis fans you know turns out we don't have anything at lmg that can run this um because it uses game port two game ports so that's to daisy chain it daisy chain it with what so like basically thrust master if you had like a hodas and you had like um your joystick and your throttle you could daisy chain and i don't know what you daisy chain it to in this scenario but that's the whole point hey there yeah okay so we had to ask anthony to bring in his computer oh and that's what this is i'm assuming yeah wow ladner computer center we were born in the same place buddy and around the same time and i know i know we should be using the crt oh yeah where's the cr it's right there it's right there but we don't have a way to screen cap oh okay uh yeah this is drifting very okay actually is it drifting or is it is what the frag [Music] i sincerely hope there's a calibration tool in their software because i have it deflected this much in order to keep the mouse from drifting to the right like oh wait oh i see oh it's got a cute little animation so you can see oh now you're not gonna be drifting now it's now there's it's in the dead zone uh-huh no it's still drifting oh no is it just maybe it was on an angle when you plugged it in okay so it's all sort of messed up because i don't know that game ports actually technically support hot plugs so we'll see how this goes okay not detected okay hey i think it zeros when you plug it in yeah are you ready for the fragmaster joystick settings interesting this early half-life one demo actually doesn't think it's crazy for you to play with a joystick okay so you need to tip it to look up and down and it'll go to the max to the max limits of looking up and down and to move forward you use a button what does sliding it to the left and right do so that does nothing not in this game in this game apparently not i don't know where's the quake bindings hold on a minute here if i have to press a button to go forward where where were the bindings push grips forward back to move forward back whoa slide grips left and right to strafe this is supposed to straight yeah it doesn't work also and it's it sits and superimposes the instructions over my or is it is that in the game no that's in their software so if you're using your mouse and keyboard and you have the fragmaster software installed it will always say that it is cool that they integrated it specifically into the tutorial and it will even time up with where you are in the tutorial this is run and this is walk i have to press both of them it's easier than a mouse and keyboard though oh yeah certainly okay i need to i want to walk so i guess i need to what's wrong linus what's wrong this controller is wrong oh okay yeah blame a shoddy workman blames his tools if i was blaming my tools you'd know what because i'd blamed you hey you got him roasted come on you invited the tool joke oh good i get to do platforming now crap this is so frustrating if i bought this i would return it immediately it's weird because i could like i can thrust forward i'm the master of that yep it's on the thrustmaster support website advanced game auto setup utility oh [Laughter] how was this advanced half-life has a joystick enabled toggle [Music] are you boys ready to master fragging we're in yeah we figured it out we hacked the matrix look at this advanced maneuver i'm gonna get so many frags the thing is having to reverse back to a neutral position to stop moving is bad right stop moving needs to be stopped moving when i'm trying to line up with a door as i'm turning into it that there's a a quarter of a second delay while i return to center i'm overshooting it yeah yeah i think it's time to move on to the sidewinder dual strike let's just hope it's not the sidewinder strike two come on that's pretty funny what limited one-year warranty included combines the agility of a game pad with the precision of a mouse rotating perspective control for three-dimensional action now you told me that this was brand new in box it was mint it was from comp usa and it had a sticker on it for the year 2000. okay it also had warranty like a it had a guaranteed warranty sticker that you could buy a warranty which is the most computer store thing in existence look at that beauty this feels more like a weird puzzle that you're trying to take apart than a game controller it doesn't even it's not a ball no it's not i expected it to be more like a track ball integrated into a thing so you actually rotate or tilt and those are the only two axes this is going to be atrocious how could they possibly have released this into the wild at least the buttons are labeled we've got a d button i mean i like the d i yeah i have a d button this feels like it would be really fatiguing to use yeah there's no way to rest you have to actually be able to manipulate it in 3d space at all times like you can't just like rest it on the desk or rest it in your lap and play all right control okay we've got a yeah here we go oh my goodness what they imagine a gamer looks like in a button-up shirt because you're microsoft and you're stuffy and it's the late 90s and you well we know that gamers are just like sitting with cheeto dust all over their desks but i mean we've got to be professional here whoa my mouse is working right now though interesting it looks like the range of motion here is just a little greater than the width of my display how am i expected to handle getting to the edge of my virtual mouse pad we'll figure it out settings oh you can change your sensitivity acceleration on and off and he also said it'd be just a joystick okay okay all right it's definitely more polished than the fragmaster all right up down pan left right move forward we're back you can see the thrust master stuff is still invading wow that's really annoying strafing works you can go at a diagonal which was kind of hard to do with the thrustmaster this hat is is awful how am i supposed to jump and crouch though if it's a and d it's good just gotta be quick oh yeah okay i got it man it really you end up with your wrist in kind of a weird position sometimes when it's not zeroed in the right spot it feels like a real good shortcut to carpel tunnel town like the fact that you can whip at all just means you have a chance to be like oh yeah enemy boom boom boom boom boom boom not being limited by just the scrolling or panning speed of a joystick is obviously superior the only question remaining dark souls players is can you even run these things on a modern computer spoiler alert with the fragmaster uh no such luck but what we haven't tried yet is the sidewinder dual strike here it is look at this sidewinder dual strike usb version one and here's my two axes it's a joystick that means any game that you could bind to joystick controls feasibly you could actually play with it it's the end of the
