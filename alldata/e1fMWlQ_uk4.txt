we're not yet at a future where the corporate media is entirely irrelevant we're in this Lial State this intermediate state where the New Media is relevant it's useful it's necessary certainly for newcomer break on the scene like me but it coexists in a landscape where the traditional Gatekeepers are still very much present relevant and important and so they realize here's the game they're going to play is take this conversation you and I are having right this is going to be a 90-minute conversation thing about a conversation is it has context what we say 40 minutes from now may call back something that you and I just spoke about 10 minutes ago all right that's the nature of this format the corporate media operates television lists take cable television as example based on two three four minute segments and so there started to be a really interesting that started to happen in July and August is by then there's a whole body of probably tens hundreds of podcasts like this that I had done where what they were able to do was to then helicopter airlift something that came out of a conversation that had context attached to it right an hour sometimes two hours worth of context around a statement but to airlift that and to put that on air in a way that was cast in a completely different context than what it was intended in the context of a two-hour conversation and it wasn't that they were just punishing me what they were doing in the process was creating a disincentive for any anybody else to actually participate in those longer form conversations because the message is if you do that do it at your own Peril because you will be punished unless you do it the standard way where you script it you don't go through exactly what the traditional assembly line is for political communication and you're going to do it through the format that we have control over or else we will punish The Defector and that's what they began to do so in August in the lead up to the first debate and this was this was somewhat damaging to me and it created a bit of a theme that the other candidates pounced on and and exploited as a theme well I'll tell you the surprising thing that happened at the first debate was remember my whole thing was in March make the debate stage what happened is in the summer I surged so much so that not only did I make the debate stage I was at the center of the very first debate stage Ronda santis and I were the two people at the center of that debate stage one of whom was the guy who was the pre-ordained Challenger and replacer of Donald Trump according to you know many pundits in the world of conservative media and then another guy who nobody had heard of at the center of sa with the former vice president multiple US senators to Governors to other people who were irritated as hell that I was there and I did not expect this dror Peterson but the thing that shocked me I enjoyed it was at that first debate I ended up being the target of every person you were actually I think in that in that room physically even and and that was interesting to me but in the leadup to that is what really gave them the ammo and this is where I wasn't strategizing at all at that point I was is just still continuing I talk to everyone's strategy I'll talk to everybody I'll talk unfiltered Etc there was a reporter from the Atlantic this is a funny story I haven't really gone into depth on this but I should there's a reporter from the Atlantic who has who has been really asking the Atlantic has been asking to do a detailed embedded profile of us you my team and I think maybe they were a little bit shudder than me on this said well we want to be careful about this I said what the hell let him in you know we talk to everybody strategy we've committed to something stick to it practice what we preach so he came to Columbus Ohio and then he was going to come on a on a private flight to whatever campaign stops we were making culminating the leadup to the first debate and there was something funny about this guy forget his name okay but the first thing he says it's weird it's like bizarre he has a he has a very mild mannered affect and he goes out of his way to say multiple times I have a stutter I was like okay I don't care if you have a stut I it doesn't matter to me but he went out of his way for me to understand that he had a stutter and he told my wife and everybody else he met apologizing profusely I have a stutter so don't mind me on this my wife is is has a wisdom that I don't but she said just be careful about this guy because of that fact right it's not that he had a stutter it's that he went out of his way to point that fact out to us that she says I think he's he's looking to potentially exploit you just be careful with him I didn't take it one way or another she you know ended up being a kaisar so kind of kind of character is what what for those of you who who know the movie reference there anyway he he he he you know follow me around builds a lot of sympathetic rapport with me and you know ends up really somewhat of intellectual smart guy ended up able to be leveling with the arguments that I was making demonstrating his Sympathy for the essence not just the superficiality but the essence of the arguments so I feel like I'm really leveling with somebody this point campaign we had learned a lesson so so what my press secretary she smartly had the habit of anytime a recorder recording the conversation she also goes on the record and Records the conversation yeah that's a good idea on the record let's make it mutually on the record now she's worked she has worked had you know 247 for a lot of the campaign one of the weekends she had she had to go to a wedding okay and this was a week this was during the flight that this gentleman and I were taking to a campaign stop where we were headed so now he has me without the uh without my sort of press person near me and I think without without being in recording he he's got his recorder on the plane okay so we're talking and I'm foolishly just you know talking away like I'm talking to a friend here to a guy who's already ingratiated himself a little bit softened His image with me I almost felt even even a little bit little bit saddened for the guy that he had this loss of self-confidence based on some attribute that wasn't his own and seemed like a a smart guy and so we're talking and he he pulls out so about two weeks before something had happened where I was on one of these podcast and a guy by the name of Alex Stein asks me he's cling kind of a quasi comedic podcast and he asked me do you believe what the governments told you about 911 and I said do I believe everything the governments told me about 911 well the reality is we know the governments lied to us based on Declassified documents that came out 20 years after 911 that Omar albumi who was a individual who was previously deemed to be a 42-year old graduate student that randomly met two of the hijackers that was the story that the 911 Commission and the FBI published 20 years ago turned out in the Declassified documents 20 years later was a Saudi intelligence operative so we know the government lied about that so based on that hard fact of course the we don't believe everything the government has told us about this now that statement was the fodder it's the classic move take something in the context of a podcast style conversation air that to the conversation about okay so here's the conversation we had on the airplane he says all right I believe the government should tell the truth about what we know about what happened on January 6th and that's something I have been very vocal about during the campaign I think government should tell us everything everything's fair game were there FBI agents in the field tell us were their FBI agents in the field were their FBI informants in the field just answer the question transparently most of the mainstream media throughout the campaign has said that the FBI director has said there were none actually that's false Christopher Ray when he's responding to Congress refused to answer the question which the media has then later reported as saying that he said there were none so I said whatever is just tell us the truth and so we have a detailed must be a 20-minute conversation easily about my view on the government's obligation to just be transparent whatever it is just let the public tell the truth publish all the video footage don't disclose some video footage and high others just tell the public the truth We the People deserve the truth so then he asked me okay well were there federal agents in the field on January 6 you know do you think it's a fair question to say were there agents on the plane on 911 now this is I mean this is a looney idea right nobody this not out a shred of evidence for this but in the context of my principled answer saying that for January 6th or for anything else the government should just tell the people the truth said look the government should tell the people the truth whatever it is I have no reason to believe that there were federal agents on the plane it's a ridiculous idea to think there were but whatever it is the government should tell the truth to the people okay on that on that segment and it was one snippet of a maybe a 30 minute conversation on this topic which is a broader two-hour conversation during a flight the story comes out this is right on the eve of the debate okay and the story comes out from the Atlantic it's in a detailed story goes into a lot of other things the one thing that the editor-in chief or whoever the main editor guy is at the Atlantic puts out and highlights is ramaswami fuels conspiracy theories asking whether there are federal agents on the planes on 911 so this is weeks later after he's come so I truthfully like I remember the January 6 conversation this was a one-off snippet I didn't remember saying that and I just told my team I was like I don't I don't remember saying that I mean clearly these people have reporting standards he was recording a conversation he's reporting on something can you just ask the Atlantic just share with us the recording where I said it just for my own knowledge of what I even said it was a free flowing conversation I'm not denying the way I was quoted but just tell me what I said they refused to Now CNN this comes full circle from the Don Lemon has their own Vengeance to square has booked me that night okay and and boy are they coming ready and I'm sure there's coordination it was it was done in a level at which it would be hard to believe there's not some level of coordination here so CNN's booked me that night and they asked me the question so so I know I'm going to get asked about this so I'd like to know so we just respectfully asked the Atlantic what did I actually say just tell me what what do you have what's the thing that you're quoting here in the article because then the article goes on there's a bunch I'm being panned across the Spectrum left and right at this point and they refuse to provide it so I go on CNN and she says you know why did you say why are you saying that there could have been Federal officers on the plane on 911 so I've never thought such a thing it's a ridic it sounds to me like a ridiculous proposition so I say look I don't think I said that I think I was I was misquoted or taken out of context that's the truth of it and I think that what I did not realize is that's when they knew they had won because she went out of her way to say oh I take you at your word there okay what they had then within hours of that interview airing the Atlantic slices just that portion where he's questioned me after the detailed discussion about January 6 would it be fair for the government to ask the question of whether were their agents on the plane on 911 just released that snippet and then CNN and the entire media has a field day because the entire slogan of my campaign is speak the truth right speak the truth when it's easy when it's hard truth is the one word slogan of my campaign they use this to damage the hell out of me and so I asked the Atlantic we said publicly you release the snippet why don't you release the entire conversation why would you to this day they haven't done it and to this day I will challenge them if you want to be honest Arbiters of it CNN the whole next day running an entire field day saying that but he said I have and if you listen to the exact footage it's even different than they describe it the exact footage is sure I think the government should tell the truth I have no reason to believe there were it seems like a ridiculous idea that there should be but whatever it is the government should tell the truth that's what I said which they summarize as saying that I'm raising conspiracy theories that there were federal agents on the plane on 911 ridiculous now you now you attribute that to so let's go into the attribution so obviously this was somewhat shocking for you shocking yeah okay so now but you you've already set up some uh diagnosis of the motivation you said that as far as you were concerned the Legacy Media wasn't very happy with you Sid stepping them let's say even though at that point you didn't really have an alternative they also weren't very happy with the fact that their attempts to pigeon hole you let's say had backfired quite spectacularly and then you had this character from the Atlantic who played I'm I'm your friend while you invited him in only to try to find um one of these situ where something you said could be taken out of context to Savage your reputation but but but but there there's the rub like why exactly is it is it just the additive combination of the reporter wants to make a name for himself the Atlantic wants to have a story CNN wants to capitalize on it along with the fact that well it would be lovely to throw some dirt on a republican because what the hell why not and to paint him with this right-wing conspiracy theory like is that sufficient is that the causal explanation for the manner in which that laid itself out and then we'll get back to what effect that had at the debate yeah so I don't think it was sufficient all those things were were definitely factors but I think this was in the context of something is going as it's not supposed to here okay there's a guy here who is advancing a trumpian worldview of positive I think of it as a positive nationalism but nationalism none Less in the United States and he is defying our expectations for what that's supposed to look like because he speaks in a manner that is at least as I'm not saying this about myself I'm saying this what I think they see in me as audite and educated from the halls of the same Ivy League colleges that they that they deemed to be their esteemed institutions and speaking in a manner that goes toe-to-toe on the facts with debating so-called the science on issues relating to covid policy or otherwise that we're unable to contend with this is a real threat we need to go after this in a deeper way because he's not given us the video clips from speeches that we can caricature we need to actually set the traps and this needs to be quashed it needs to be quashed now and by the way this social media thing that's sidest stepping us to hell with that that's creating the disinformation that's creating the alternative the misinformation that allows candidates like this to rise it is our job and our social responsibility as a media institution to extinguish that possibility let's punish his ability to do that by lifting some of the comments he's made in those lwd settings offline from the traditional media that individual citizens are beginning to access to their own paril and set the record straight for how this is done were the people who vet who actually become serious presidential candidates when he's a non-serious contender who cares but this guy's rising in the polls to become a serious presidential candidate could really have an impact in shaping public opinion we have an ability and a responsibility to make sure that doesn't happen cut his legs off I think was exactly what happened and then you have the industrialized politics in a Republican primary where that provides the fodder for other candidates who were frustrated by the same thing happening to be able to use that to their advantage not even the candidates but in many cases even the super Pacs supporting them which is part of this industrialized Cesspool of the modern industry of American politics that's really what happened
