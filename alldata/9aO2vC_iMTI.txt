Hello everyone and welcome Perhaps you have driven or perhaps you've purchased the vehicle with a small turbocharged engine and it claimed you know It's going to have the power of a v6 and yet the fuel economy of a small four-cylinder and then you're actually driving around and you're noticing your numbers don't quite match up with the numbers you saw on the sticker saying you're Gonna get this kind of fuel economy in this car so in this video We're gonna be talking about why small turbocharged engines may not always get the great fuel economy That they claim to and so we're gonna talk about some of the benefits There are legitimate reasons why you might want to have a downsized turbocharged engine But then we're going to get into why you may not actually see in the real world those kind of fuel economy numbers That the manufacturers are claiming it will get and so starting off with the benefits Why might you downsize an engine and throw a turbocharger on it? Well, the benefits are very real the engines smaller it weighs less It's got less moving parts. You've got less friction. You've got less pumping losses And so depending on the loading scenario on that engine how you're driving it you can actually get really good fuel economy with these small Turbocharged engines, but then you start asking for power and things change up a bit and so looking at an engine here And I've got plenty of videos talking about how turbochargers work, but a very simple representation here. We've got our engine We've got the turbocharger this thing spools up with the exhaust gasses and it pulls in additional air So let's say you know We have atmospheric pressure within this engine that's about fourteen point seven or about fifteen psi. And Using this turbocharger this compressor right here. We're able to add in seven-and-a-half psi of Additional boost so now we've got about 50% more oxygen within this engine and as a result We inject more fuel and as a result of having more air and more fuel burning we get you know Somewhere around 50% more power. So the idea behind a turbocharger is very clever It allows you to have small displacement engines that still get a lot of power But it may come down to being power or efficiency Not necessarily, you know both at the same time, even though there are ways to indeed have both at the same time Which we'll get into later. Now. The problem with turbocharged engines is knuck And so one of the things manufacturers have to design for is how do we eliminate not? so what is not well as that piston is compressing that air & fuel mixture on its way up towards the top of the Cylinder, you have your spark plug fire and it of course ignites the air fuel mixture But the temperature and the pressure because it's turbocharged is very high and so you may have pockets where that air fuel mixture Is hot enough that it ignites on its own and then as a result You have two ignition sources You have these colliding flame fronts and in a worst case you can have quite severe damage if you have really bad engine nook and so a Turbocharged engine it's adding in air. It's adding in fuel and As a result you're having higher cylinder pressures So each individual cylinder has higher pressures and as a result Each individual cylinder has higher temperatures and all of this gives you a greater likelihood to have not okay so what things can the manufacturers do in order to eliminate not so that you can still have high boost levels high power and not have this knock destroying your Engine. Well, you can use you can retard the ignition timing, but that means you're not going to be as efficient You're not gonna make as much power so you don't want to do that You can lower the compression ratio, which also means less power overall and lower efficiency But you will often notice the turbocharged engines use Significantly lower compression ratios than other style engines and that's to help reduce the likelihood of having knock and that in itself Makes the engine less efficient But the real kicker here and the real reason why you may not see great fuel economy Using your downsize turbocharged engine has to do with the air fuel mixture at these higher loads So what happens is as you floor it in that small turbocharged engine It wants to avoid these high temperature scenarios in each cylinder and one of the ways it does that is by using a really rich Air fuel mixture. So ideally you're running somewhere around fourteen point seven to one air to fuel ratio That's the ideal amount where you're gonna burn all the oxygen. You're gonna burn all the fuel It's gonna work out great but when you're running at high boost levels and high throttle you're going to lower that from fourteen point seven to perhaps Eleven to one perhaps twelve to one in order to bring the temperature in that cylinder down And so that might seem strange that injecting more fuel actually brings the temperature down but it does part of the reason why is as you inject that fuel and it has the phase change from a liquid to a Gas, it drops the temperature within there so you're injecting more fuel purely to lower the temperature within that cylinder and as Of doing this you're able to avoid knock and create lots of power. Of course The downside is by having that rich air fuel mixture. You're not creating power very efficiently And so if you're to look at a graph of torque here on the vertical axis and then rpm on the horizontal axis And you look at the torque curve of a turbocharged engine So it'll start somewhat low come up as that turbo builds boost and then taper off as it starts to get You know too much speed for that turbocharger. And so you look at you know, this is what your your peak torque is What the engine is totally capable of and then if you were to look at you know How much torque can you create how much torque? Can you ask for how much throttle can you ask for from that engine before? It has to start enriching that air fuel mixture in order to avoid knock and it's generally not going to be very much So that's this line right here so you can see that you know without applying too much throttle you're going to get past this point where you can still use an Ideal air fuel ratio and still make efficient power then you're going to go beyond that And once you're beyond that you're using that rich air fuel mixture, and as a result, you're getting lots of power great But you're not doing it very efficiently and so with a naturally aspirated engine Let's say a larger naturally aspirated engine which has its drawbacks. You don't want that many cylinders You don't want that size necessarily for the low load scenarios. But as you add those cylinders The amount of work that each cylinder is doing is less the amount of air and fuel going into one cylinder is less So those cylinder pressures are lower The temperatures are lower and as a result you don't have to use as rich of air/fuel mixtures and so by using a Less rich air fuel mixture in these high torque scenarios in a naturally aspirated engine you're able to get a better You're able to get more power for the amount of fuel that you're injecting into it So, you know the benefit of these small turbo engines at low loads you can get good fuel economy But then once you start asking for those higher amounts of power and order for it to avoid knock It has to use a really rich mixture and so you get poor fuel economy Now, why do this? Why go this strategy? Well from the manufacturers end if they're looking to publish, you know EPA city and highway numbers and that cycle doesn't have much demand if the demand is all on this low-end Well, then you can use a small turbo engine to kind of trick that test into showing great fuel economy numbers whereas if you were to start getting into those higher load scenarios, those fuel economy numbers are going to go down and so You know that's kind of an interesting thing where it's a manufacturer choice of how accurate do they want their EPA published numbers to represent the fuel economy that you're actually going to get and so The next video that I make and I'll include a link to it somewhere around here once it's actually published but the next video I make is going to be on Mazdas 2.5 liter turbo and we're going to be talking about how they actually design in order to raise this level right here at which you Can have increased loads and still be within that stoichiometric air fuel ratio and still get a good amount of power without Sacrificing your fuel economy nearly as much as some other styles of small turbos So look forward to that video if you have any questions or comments, of course, feel free to leave those below.
