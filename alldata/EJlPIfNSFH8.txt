in this video we're going to be reviewing cs50s web programming with python and javascript is it really the best free course to learn web development let's find out if you've been following this channel you know how much of a fan i am of ps50s first course their introduction to computer science so after finishing that to my absolute delight i saw that they have more courses available for example their introductory course on artificial intelligence and their introduction to web development with python and javascript which will be the topic of this review if you know where cs50 is an extremely popular introductory course on computer science that's widely regarded as the best free computer science course that you can do online so right after finishing it i knew i wanted more so i started their web course which promises to quote continue right where cs50 left off and provide a strong foundation in web development and after completing e as they put it you will emerge with knowledge and experience in principles languages and tools that empower you design and deploy applications on the internet so the question is does cs50's web course live up to the extremely high bar set by its predecessor just like the previous course csv web is divided into eight weeks but there's no time limit to this week so i just think of them as sections that you can do in any time you want each week consists of a lecture video some accompanying lecture notes as well as a project slash problem set for you to do based on the materials that you learned that week and if you saw my cs50 review you know that cs50s assignments are extremely hard and if you do cs50s web course you will see that the projects are even harder and even more substantial than the predecessor so that's the first real difference that i saw but again if you saw my cs60 review you know that i actually think that if the assignments are difficult that is a good thing because that's pushing you to learn more and also get used to the fact that programming in the real world is not always easy after the first couple of weeks these projects are like full-fledged web applications so just be prepared for that they're not something that you'll do in a couple of hours in one night a lot of time they would take several days for me to complete i'll put up the topics of each week on the screen and now so you can look at them but essentially the course teaches you to build a full web application from start to finish both including the front end and the back end he uses obviously html css and javascript in the front end so if you've learned those before then the first couple of weeks might be a bit boring but it will also teach you some more advanced concepts in these things so even if you know some css already it's still worth doing the sections on css on this course on the backend the course uses python and just and specifically the django framework and it also introduces you to popular technologies like bootstrap some apis and sql if statement is beginning and ending in django the indentation is optional inside of the template but in order to distinguish when the if statement is happening from when in terms of the lectures to my initial disappointment cs50 web is actually not taught by david the excellent and renowned lecturer from the first course instead it's taught by brian yu who was sort of in an assistant role in the first course but in this course he really takes center stage and he's the one who's going to be teaching all the lectures but this disappointment was very quickly forgotten as brian is also an excellent teacher he doesn't have quite the same like enthusiasm and the jokes as david does but he's still a very excellent teacher with an extremely clear teaching style no complaints there i honestly think that the whole education industry should be taking notes from cs50 because how much you learn something and how much you end up actually understanding about what you're learning really depends on who's teaching you and it really depends on the style of the teacher because if someone is teaching in an engaging style it actually makes you want to learn that thing and if you want to learn that thing it's always so much easier to learning because when you don't have to force yourself to listen to some boring hi who's explaining something but the real reason why cs50 and this new core cs50 web are so good is because the style of the courses makes you excited and want to learn the things but that being said it does have a considerably smaller number of these very high budget visualizations and these demonstrations that the first course is really famous for although he does do his job exceptionally well most of the lectures are just essentially brian coding stuff on the screen and then explaining it rather than these very elaborate demonstrations that the first course has so that is definitely a corner compared to the first course but then again it does really make sense a lot of those high budget things they take a lot of money and because ccd's original course is the main selling point of this theme it sort of makes sense that you couldn't expect the same from this more specialized follower of course one tip i do have with the lectures is you should probably try to sort of split them into multiple parts even if you are watching them at 1.5 times speed like i am it is a lot to take in the lectures move at a very fast space and you really need to be concentrated at all times to really grasp what is being said that you really don't want to miss anything so what i would recommend is probably splitting each lecture at least in the two parts so you watch the first one take a break maybe like what you want to do the following day to finish it just so that you make sure that you keep your concentration the whole time because it can be a lot to take in in one go but now moving on to the projects itself that you are going to be building as i said the goal of the course is to teach you to build a full-fledged web application the great thing about this course is you essentially build a lot of these already during the course and it's not like most courses where you build some like very basic tic-tac-toe or something like that no no these are like actual full-on projects with a full front end and a back end that like throughout the course they become more and more complex as you sort of learn more things but they do take up a significant amount of time a lot more than even the ones in csu's original course i would estimate that you should spend at least six even probably more hours per project but if that seems daunting to you then remember that in your career as a web developer or whatever you want to do you are going to be building very complex projects and you're going to be working with code bases that are even more complex than the ones that you have here so again the fact that they're complex the fact that they are difficult it's getting you used to the fact that this is what working as a web developer in the real world is going to be it's not going to be easy so to give you an idea the projects you are going to be building are a google search clone a wiki page an email app a social network site a common slash auction site so i made like a camera auction site for example as well as a final project of your choosing for example for my final project for this course i actually made the first version of my website you can go check it out on my website it looks a bit different now than it did back then after doing this course you will be able to build a full website which is pretty cool and the great thing about these projects because they are so complex there are just projects that you can just go put on your portfolio after that that will actually keep you motivated to actually make them good and to actually go out of your way to make them look nice to actually spend time doing other things because these are the projects that you can probably even use to apply for jobs have this set of css properties maybe halfway through the animation have a different set of css properties and then at the very end have yet another set of just how hard is the course well it's it's very hard in my opinion in fact i do think that it's even harder than cs50s original course it starts off quite easily especially if you've already done some basic html css or javascript the first couple of weeks are actually going to be pretty easy i wouldn't say easy but not that hard and the projects you build in the first few weeks are more like practice projects and better the other ones but it does go from zero to 100 very very quickly so just be prepared for that in general don't be deterred by the fact that the course is hard as a programmer in general you should be having a growth mindset which means that any challenge you have ahead of you or anything that you have to learn but you don't know yet the way you should be thinking about this like okay if it's hard it just means that i need to spend a lot of time and put in a lot of effort to solve these problems and to learn these things the way i think about anything is that there's obviously a lot of things that i don't know yet but if i had to learn something i honestly believed that i could literally do anything like sure there's some things i probably couldn't learn like it would be difficult to like become the best footballer in the world or something but most things are figure outable i assume that anything that there is to learn anything i need to know i can learn it if i just putting enough effort and that's really the attitude that you should have going to this course that's the attitude that you should have as a program as a software engineer and that's the attitude that you should have in life in general it just makes life so much nicer when you just assume that you can do something you're going to come across a lot of obstacles in this course that you won't be able to do immediately so what i want to challenge you to do is then just instead of thinking oh i can't do it think how can i do it google go to stack overflow ask people there's gonna be a way to figure out how to do these things i figured it out many people have figured out you can do it too so the most important thing when going into this course or something else that's difficult is just having the right kind of mindset and assume that you can do it because you can i know it programming at its core and most jobs in general are about solving problems if you want to provide value in the world you need to be able to solve problems and if solving the kinds of problems that this course gives you is not for you that's fine but maybe that just means that programming isn't for you because what you're doing to be doing in this course the problems that you're gonna face are very similar to the kinds of problems that you will probably be facing in your career as a web developer so just keep that in mind so as a conclusion should you do this course well if you've already done cs50s introduction to computer science and you do want to go into web development specifically or just learn about it because you want to i think this is an excellent course to get started learning web developer the course is completely free you don't have the paper and i want to say this edx is going to try to sell you this like verified part of this like certificate thing do not pay for it you do not have to pay for it when you complete this course you get a free certificate when you submit all the projects you are going to get a certificate from harvard for completely free you do not need to pay for the edx certificate i said this in my previous review about cs50 and people still ask me like oh should i pay for the certificate no i i said this in the review people still ask you should not pay for the certificate don't pay for it so after doing this course you are going to know how to build a website but it's not going to make you an expert it's probably going to get you the point where you can then go out and start building things on your own to add to your portfolio and just keep learning more based on like documentation or maybe doing some follow-up courses or something like that so just bear that in mind you are still going to have to do more learning after this but that's an introduction to the field it's an excellent course in my opinion but for now whatever method you start using to learn web development or coding the hardest part is figuring out the right methods the right ways of studying that are going to allow you to learn most effectively and this is something i've spent like years mastering like figuring out the right methods to study because if you can study more effectively you can literally learn in one hour but someone else might spend three hours learning so that's exactly why you absolutely must check out this video next when i talk about my biggest hack my favorite method to really master really complicated math and coding concepts really fast
