foreign welcome back to talk Tech with Tiff in this 
episode I sat down with Nick who most recently   held a position as ux researcher at Google 
prior to that she's worn many different hats   from software developer data analyst and so 
many other roles which we dive into recently   she was impacted by the layoffs at Google 
and she shares about her experience through   that also I link down below my newsletter 
which covers job postings career tips and   so much more so make sure to go check it 
out alright let's get started welcome to   talk Tech with tip the New York Edition where 
I am sitting down with industry professionals   to hear about their career Journeys and current 
roles I created this series to hear from people   who are established in the tech industry so 
that we can all learn what these individuals   do in their day-to-day jobs and the types of 
opportunities out there [Music] [Applause]   hi Tiffany how are you today I'm great super 
excited to be here Tiffany I am so excited I'm   definitely more I I'm so excited to be here with 
you today because as I was saying to you earlier   I've been reading a lot about hackware and your 
your journey and the mission behind hackware   which we'll dive into in a second here and I'm 
really excited too but before we even do that   can you tell me a little bit about yourself and 
uh and your journey yeah I'm Tiffany Riggs I'm the   founder and CEO of hackware and uh prior to hack 
where I I'm a Serial entrepreneur but I've always   been in Tech I love technology it was a place 
where I feel like I found my tribe because the way   I talk the way I think and then I met people who 
sort of talked and thought the way I did so I went   to school for computer science I went to school 
in Atlanta Georgia at a historically black college   and university Clark Atlanta University study 
computer science loved it because it it appealed   to my my thought process of solving problems and 
now I had a tool to solve problems yeah and then   you know started my first company when I was in 
college and then started four other companies and   have always just love how technology evolves 
we're moved into cyber security and worked   as an ethical hacker and um yeah I love this 
Dynamic of cyber security it's about identifying   risk vulnerabilities and then using software 
as a tool to solve those those problems so I   you know that's a little bit about me but I'm 
happy to dive in more I love that when you went   to computer science and you mentioned that you 
really enjoyed it because it it related to the   way you think with solving problems but prior 
to going into or knowing computer science or   I guess my question is how did you know computer 
science was for you uh was there courses in high   school you took or how did you initially Discover 
it good question well when I started there wasn't   any programming classes like there are for many 
students now for me when I got started it was   typing classes and so it was about learning how 
to type and wanting to learn how to type fast   um and that was like my entry into sort of 
technology and then the other thing was I am   a gamer my growing up I grew up with my brother 
my cousin and the way for me to be able to have   fun with them was gaming and I knew that 
technology was for me but was because it   unlocked the curiosity where I wanted to know how 
do these games work they look so real and I would   break them open I had a Game Boy back then that's 
that was popular game boys and so I would break it   open because I wanted to know how did it work and 
I was trying to figure out like how do they make   these characters so real and I want to reverse 
engineer and figure out how I can build it wow   um and then I went to my guidance counselor 
and for me it was two options it was going into   technology computer science or it was going into 
being a veterinarian like I love pets so um and at   that time they had these uh forecasts of you know 
what you when you get out of college like what   does that outlook look like and for Tech it was a 
very promising Outlook and where I'm from I come   from very humble beginnings where um there's not 
many uh people who from where I'm from going to   college or you know definitely getting into Tech 
and so I saw this as an opportunity where I could   do something that I love and when I get out I can 
have a a good life a good outcome and immediately   when I took my first computer science class that's 
when I knew that I made the right decision because   it was it was just all about like figuring out how 
to build something and how do you create something   in all of the all of these challenges and problems 
and and how do you solve them and that for me was   um my jam like that was what I felt like I 
I finally was in a place where I felt like   this is is for me although it wasn't many who 
women and others uh minorities who were there   other but I felt like mentally this was for 
me this was for me I it's so interesting you   mentioned you were sharing a story about how you 
would essentially reverse engineer your uh play   State PlayStation game boy game boys yes Game 
Boy and it's foreshadowing into essentially you   know what it was like from such a young age what 
you're doing the business you built today which   is a very interesting story as well but before we 
get into what you're up to today with hack where   I'd love to hear more about some of the uh other 
businesses that you have founded and you know what   what you really enjoyed about them or what you've 
learned from them throughout your throughout that   entrepreneurial Journey yeah Tiff I think for me 
it's all about not waiting for someone to solve   my problem and the problem was burning um so deep 
where I just couldn't let it go yeah and so the   first problem that I was solving really was when 
I was in Atlanta Georgia I learned how to build   technology I learned how to build software and 
I built this point of sale software solution and   then for me my entrepreneur side kicked in and I 
was thinking well is there an opportunity for me   to sell this software that I built my dad was 
an entrepreneur I've always wanted to build a   big business and so for me it was it was thinking 
okay I have this software I want to see if I can   sell it and I sold it to some local restaurants in 
the area wow and then from there it was all right   um how do I they were small small mom and pop 
restaurants that needed a way to be able to   check out funds and transfer funds easily and 
they needed an easy user interface to make that   happen and it worked well in that demographic but 
where the challenge happened was going upstream   and working with larger chain restaurants which 
I learned really quickly that there's a it wasn't   a company that was backed by investors it was a 
bootstrap business which mean I used all my funds   and whatever Revenue I got in I had to use that 
to grow the company and so the challenge was going   Upstream it's a longer sales cycle and and there 
wasn't any funds coming in but expenses were going   out and so it failed because the learning was just 
trying to understand cell cycles making sure that   you can you know have enough Capital to be able to 
handle that Venture but the smart thing for me I   learned that I take into my business is having 
a diverse A diversity of types of businesses   to withhold to to handle you know different cell 
cycle so I like having ones that pay faster which   is you know shorter small businesses they can pay 
faster the decision making process is shorter and   then you know that could then that allows me to 
be able to work with businesses that are bigger   that have a longer sales cycle and then the other 
business that I built was I had moved to Atlanta   Georgia when although I'm here in New York City 
now I'm originally from Dallas Texas okay and   so I moved to Atlanta Georgia and I was the only 
person there I didn't know anyone yeah and I love   hair yeah but I couldn't it's a hard thing to be 
able to find beauty services in a city that you're   new to at that time yes and so I decided I wanted 
to build a Marketplace that could make it easy   for people to get Beauty services and it focused 
focused on the minority community so being able   to you know get local hair stylists and Beauty 
professionals to be able to show their work on   my platform and then be able to put a appointment 
setting capabilities where their customers can   book right there on the platform there's a lot of 
platforms that do that now but back then yeah 10   years ago that wasn't a thing and then the other 
side was now the this audience this customer base   can you know be able to look and see does this 
you know Beauty professional can they do what I   need them to do for me and so it was a two-sided 
Marketplace but the thing is with the two-sided   Marketplace it's a chicken and egg problem and 
so you have to make sure you have enough uh   Beauty professionals there who have 
appointments open to be able to handle   that demand and then you also have to have you 
know those consumers who are there who want to   buy from those professionals and make them want 
to put more of their services on the platform   um and so it was just the challenge of trying 
to get those two things to work and then also I   was a mom I just had my um my daughter who was an 
infant and trying to manage this new business we   had celebrity hair stylists on it it had scale it 
had an audience but that audience it was trying to   figure out how do we make this audience pay and 
it was another bootstrap business so trying to   um you know get the audience to pay was which was 
a challenge and then my third business which kind   of comes to a little bit of the beginning of hack 
where was I had a commute so this business was a   business that I was also working with one of 
the largest defense contractors working with   the United States Air Force in the Navy and that 
was my day job but my problem that I was trying   to solve was how do I get from point A from home 
to work in a way that um isn't stressful so my   commute I had a three hour round-trip commute 
that's a long command yeah and so I was trying   to figure out okay well I know that there's many 
who have this same problem how do we all get to   point A to point B and share this ride together 
where it's you know a we're we're solving the pain   point of the cost but also we're saving ourselves 
time and uh and so that was a great solution it   I launched it in Dallas I launched it in DC I was 
showcased at South by Southwest so it launched it   launched it in um Austin and then had an exit with 
that so I successfully sold that technology to   another company congratulations thank you and then 
I just decided I was tired of Entrepreneurship   okay and what's funny is that I love technology 
I love businesses but it's it is a very very   tough thing to do and then when I started I'm 
wondering why do I keep doing this to myself   um and so I um uh and so I went and I started 
working for uh 100 just working in Corporate   America and that that allowed me to understand how 
do you build enterprise software yeah because it's   different when you have a startup and you 
and you're building something but there's   not really like formal processes to your 
software software development life cycle   um but when you're working at an Enterprise you 
get to learn how to build Enterprise Solutions   um but that led me to the journey of you know 
working with the military and learning okay now I   know how to build Enterprise Solutions but I also 
have to learn how to build resilient software yes   you know that can handle you know cyber criminals 
trying to exploit and try to figure out how they   can get in you know um and I and we're going 
to talk a little bit more about this but that's   something that we forget in the development World 
our code if we're not thinking about it from a   security mindset it could be exploited um and so 
work there for some time and then I realized that   the entrepreneurship bug was biting me again but 
I didn't have a product at the time okay and so I   was just thinking about well I know I can build I 
love building I could just build for others and so   I built a consultant consultancy and I was able to 
bring on my employer as one of our first contracts   yeah that's pretty incredible Congratulations 
by the way I think that's a huge win to go from   I'm kind of interjecting for a second with that 
I just think that's huge to go from working   for someone to them still paying you but in a 
different way yeah you're now you know that's   really that's incredible but I tell people that 
all the time it's about relationship building yeah   so even if you are at when I was in a a company 
I was an entrepreneur yeah like I knew that you   know even though I wasn't having my own company 
this department that I was working in this was   my company I love that and so you know building 
those relationships yeah and then deciding to   leave leaving on positive terms making sure that 
the company that I'm leaving that they can still   be successful so if I need to go back in another 
capacity with an entrepreneurship venture or if I   need to come back because I just need to work with 
them again I can exactly um and so you know that's   that's really important just to never you know 
no matter the relationship to not burn a bridge   because you never the world is so small and then 
when you get in the tech world it's even smaller   and if you don't know that person they might know 
someone that knows you and whatnot and it's I   love looking at it from the perspective treating 
treating where you were working in the time in   Corporate America as as your own business because 
someone who so for myself right now I'm working at   a startup and then as I have a business uh through 
Tiffin Tech on the side I I can relate so much to   to the owner of that startup in the sense that 
this is their baby yeah this is so important   to them so how would I want my my my work 
my employees to to go about their day and   whatnot I always keep that in mind because uh you 
never know when it will come full circle again   and that's key and those are the best people to 
work with you know is someone who understands the   entrepreneurship Journey yes and that's why a lot 
of times when you see startup job postings yeah   and there A lot of times they're calling out they 
want somebody who has had a startup maybe you know   entrepreneur minded because they understand the 
Journey of trying to build something from nothing   and how it can be hard but also being able to 
put yourself in the CEO's shoes because you've   been there exactly exactly and when you you're 
after you left Corporate America you went into   creating your own consulting company how did that 
leave lead into what you were doing today with   hackware actually maybe a question that before you 
share that uh how would for those watching who are   not familiar with hackware we keep on mentioning 
it throughout so what what is hackware thank you   for asking hackware is a cyber security learning 
platform so we use AI to help companies protect   their end users with phishing education and we 
build AI driven fishing simulations that learn   from real threats we also are training the user 
after that simulation is sent how do they change   their risky Behavior so how do they with the 
micro video um understand how to not fall for   a phishing attack when it actually happens and so 
this is an automated platform that is working for   course lean security teams to make sure that the 
employees that they support can can Empower them   to report avoid these phishing attacks that 
are happening every day and that's becoming   I mean I'm preaching the choir to you but that 
is becoming more and more important as the day   as the hours go by and when you started hackware 
what what inspired you to start it was it through   working closely with the Navy or what was your 
journey from Consulting your Consulting business   into hackware yeah the journey was really we were 
trying to solve a problem for us in-house yeah   um so there was a the thing I love about 
hack where that I can see now is that it   is it combines two of my loves again cyber 
security so trying to find vulnerabilities and   we did that with our red team operations ethical 
hacking so we would go to an organization would   hire us because they wanted to know how a cyber 
criminal could get into their organization and   it's all about showing them all of the areas 
where it could be through fishing it could be   through some application vulnerability and then 
from there one of the so then it was how do I   use my solution background to build a solution to 
solve that problem that we found yeah um and so   that's where the software engineering side came 
in and one of the things that I kept singing was   with our engagements with working with military 
contractors and then working with small businesses   Enterprise businesses when we would do these red 
team operations fishing was always a way that we   could show them that a cyber criminal could get 
to their end users and then take data out of the   organization and that was a trend across all size 
companies but the problem is running a business in   labor so it's a service business that we have and 
all of us spending the time running these fishing   uh these these red team operations it became too 
expensive and I wanted to build a tool in-house   that could automate and do this stuff for us so it 
could you know understand what's going on in the   threat landscape because that's what we would do 
we would go and look and try to see how are these   phishing attacks happening and then try to look at 
the organization understand the the employees that   they have figure out who would be a good Target 
and then from there craft a email to try to see if   these employees are going to fall for it and that 
takes time sometimes that can take two to four   weeks doing that exercise and trying to do it over 
and over again and so I wanted a product in-house   that could automate that for us where we can go 
do other things it worked really well for us and   then I was like I finally got a product because I 
love products yes I love product and I'm not much   I don't really like the service side of things 
yeah it's great but it's not for me and so then I   thought okay I know that there's other businesses 
who have this problem um and so I decided to work   with some companies that had a service business a 
managed service side of managed service companies   who in the Dallas area needed a solution like this 
okay I sold it to these uh organizations in Dallas   and then they gave feedback so they said it works 
well the phishing simulations are real but what   do we do after that so you're showing me all of 
these people who are vulnerable to fishing yeah   um and you're not remediating this risk you're not 
helping me solve this problem is put a solution   in place yes you're showing the problems what 
Solutions yeah and then they're so busy they're   they're thinking well I don't have the time to 
create a solution I don't have a time to go in   now and try to figure out what training 
do I need to send to all of these people   um and the tools that were out there there 
are other tools that are focusing on security   awareness that's where we play but again they 
were manual it required someone to go in and   roll someone into these courses and then follow 
up yeah yeah so then I decided okay we got the   feedback they like the fishing simulation part 
of the platform that's working great that has   the wow factor but now we need to train these 
in in individual users and so we we're meeting   the needs for the administrator the security 
administrators but we have to create an experience   that the employees wanna take the video they want 
to watch the video they want to learn and learn   from it yeah so that was another challenge wow and 
then we learned short is the key yeah so we have   to right when they fail a phishing simulation and 
roll them into a short like right then and there   based on their what they uh got wrong yeah and 
now the adoption is more it's easier to consume   just like content now content now is short form 
yes people don't want to sit through long no   content yeah unless it's something that they're 
super passionate about yeah but employees might   not be super passionate about they're like I'm 
doing this to accuse my employer no yeah but   then they're actually learning as they're doing 
it right yeah yeah so like people like us who   are into Tech and into cyber security yeah we 
probably wouldn't mind exciting be excited and   want to and want to learn more but you have 
you know different functional groups in an   organization where they just want to know how can 
I do my job more securely and can I give back to   my job yes and that's exactly and that's where we 
came up with the version of hackware that is being   used today that is being used today and you have 
really shared the the progress or the Journey of   hack where where it started and how 
it's continued to evolve as you see   uh the needs from from your current clients 
and as the tech industry is evolving is there   and maybe Tiffany you can't share too much I'm 
not sure but is there something you can share   with us that is coming up next for hackware 
or is it more like stay tuned kind of thing   or yeah I mean we're always evolving and I 
mean and this is where I get excited because   I really love the the way that AI products have 
get are getting adopted now yeah when hackware   first came out it was a product when you mentioned 
artificial intelligence or machine learning people   did not get excited about that there was a little 
bit of fear and you know concern about well what   is this thing actually going to be doing yeah and 
uh but now the exciting thing is just seeing how   um it's really exciting to see how people 
are trying to find applications for AI in   there in their in their day-to-day and so 
I think we're just going to keep dialing   dialing into the on that I mean the thing 
that we're trying to do is make sure that   our uh generative fishing capabilities 
that it continues to to emulate and maybe   um there's two sides we want to make sure that 
if someone in our Network email gets compromised   which is called a business email compromise uh 
attack and then they use that person's inbox to to   go after people in that user's Network now so the 
the thing here is that you want to make sure that   the sometimes the content is on par with what 
this individual will say and so when I'm when   we talk about generative AI we want to make 
sure that we can impersonate this individual   in what they potentially would say and but again 
we're trying to help end users create that pause   um where maybe they are looking at the contents 
and and maybe there's something in there that   is off about the message but really trying to 
take it a little bit higher in and elevated   because that's how some of these attacks 
are happening and then the other side of   business email compromise scams is now we're 
going to do a test where we're going to say   something that this person wouldn't say 
like it's their inbox but they may work in   um they may work in finance and so that's true 
and there is a there is money that is there but   the the policy and process for asking for funds 
or wire transfers is is what we're doing is going   outside of that process so it could be that we're 
sending an email asking for funds to be wired but   this is not what Tiff would ask even though it's 
in her role and it's in her responsibilities this   isn't what she would ask yeah um and so we want to 
continue to elevate that we have the capabilities   but it's all about continuing to evolve and learn 
and then also on the training side building a true   recommendation engine that is going to keep 
looking at what has this person watched and   almost like Netflix trying to understand what 
should they watch next yeah like where have   they come from what have they seen what else can 
we help educate them with yeah yeah I feel like   and I feel like I could sit down with you for 
hours on end because your personal Journey or your   career journey and and uh even with hackware 
there's so much to dive into and for those   watching though what is I always like to to end 
these these conversations with what is some advice   that you would give your younger self and and I 
like to end it with that because I mean I just I   really your career journey is so interesting 
and how you speak of Entrepreneurship I find   so inspiring uh how you just go after things and 
just figure it out along the way uh so what is   some advice you'd give to to your younger self my 
younger self I would there's so much time spent   preparing and sometimes you you spend I spend way 
much time just overly preparing like looking at   all of the different scenarios and then once I get 
there I realize I really didn't need to do I spent   so much time yeah you know preparing um and it's 
all about sometimes getting enough information for   this this level that I'm at and then just taking 
that step versus thinking 30 steps ahead and it's   a waste of time because there's so much there's 
especially in this environment like things are   changing so much and it's changing so fast and 
it's really all about just getting started and   that's what I tell my team and anyone who's who's 
getting involved into technology really it's all   about just taking the step of starting and then 
just Compound on it just keep compound compound   pounding on it and not about thinking and not 
focusing on making your first step the perfect   step the right step because it's information it 
can help you along your journey but you're gonna   waste so much time just trying to to prepare 
that you're you're going to be missing missing   some opportunities so for me it's just about what 
do we need right now to get started and then we   can build build build build iterative approach 
I love it that's what uh I would tell myself I   have to keep telling myself yes I hear you and 
it's so true especially as as someone who is a   bit tries not to be a bit of a perfectionist it's 
like well you know I gotta wait till this is in   place or this is the place like no just start you 
know even with your story starting out in uh POS   like point of sale and then going into a beauty 
entrepreneurship it's completely on paper anyways   it looks like it's so different than hackware but 
at the end of the day the skills you have yeah so   much to learn from all of those Ventures and yeah 
when you look at it from the outside it doesn't   make sense but it makes sense to me so many things 
that I've taken away and it's compounded where it   helps me into in what I'm doing now and I'm sure 
you know once this journey is done and I move on   to something else that'll be helpful you know 
for the next step exactly I love that that's   great advice to end on just get started just start 
yeah yeah thank you so much for your time Tiffany   it was such a pleasure to sit down with you and 
uh really hear about your journey and then also   to about hackwear and for everyone watching I 
will link more information about hackware and   Tiffany down below I keep on wanting to call 
you Tiff because I call myself Tiffany I'll   uh vote Tiffany down below and uh thank you again 
thank you Tiff thank you for having me thank you [Music] thank you
