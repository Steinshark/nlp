hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about the engine in the new koenigsegg jessico so this is a very crazy very wild super powerful uh new mega car that koenigsegg has released and in this video we're gonna break down the engine some of the different components there's all kinds of clever engineering that koenigsegg has done with this engine so we will start off talking about the specifications and then work through some of the very cool unique features of this engine and how it has changed from the aguera rs so just like the aguero rs it is powered by a 5 liter twin turbocharged v8 engine and now it is producing 1280 horsepower on a pump gas on 91 octane us or 95 octane europe or 1600 horsepower if it is running on e85 it is capable of producing 1500 newton meters of torque or 1100 pound-feet so we've just heard about ram's new heavy-duty truck that has a thousand pound feet of torque this has eleven hundred pound feet of torque and like a thousand more horsepower uh than that ram truck so 1600 horsepower a thousand newton meters of torque from just 2700 rpm with that peak torque coming on at 5100 rpm that range of a thousand newton meter plus of torque from 2700 to 61.70 rpm and then revving all the way to 8500 rpm thanks to a flat plane crankshaft which we will get into later in the video now koenigsegg claims that this vehicle should be able to reach 300 miles per hour i really hope we see a production car making this magical number it'd be super cool to see and also this will likely be the very last purely internal combustion engine powered koenigsegg so the future will have hybrids much like the regera and electric cores that koenigsegg will be developing this one being the last purely uh gasoline-based ethanol-based engine that they will have within their vehicles but they're going out with a bang this is the most powerful internal combustion engine they have ever created and koenigsegg states that this is the most powerful homologated production internal combustion engine ever now because they lead that statement with we believe legally it really has no meaning but that doesn't matter i don't know of another production engine which is globally street legal and globally meets a mission so very cool that's very hard to do when you're trying to create an engine that has 1600 horsepower but also meet all of the emission regulations of this planet to keep it nice and green and all that fun stuff so first off gasoline versus e85 it can run on either so it has a flex fuel sensor it's able to determine what fuel is going into those injectors what's being injected into the engine it reads that sends that information to the ecu which determines how much power it can make and adjusts things like timing or fuel ratio boost accordingly and so with gasoline 91 octane in the us 95 octane in europe those are the same octane rating we just use different scales it will make 1280 horsepower using e85 which has a higher octane rating than pure gasoline does so pure uh ethanol will be you know well above 100 octane rating and so that gives you some flexibility with what you can do with the engine so they're able to create 1600 horsepower running on e85 85 ethanol so by using ethanol you have the benefit of that higher octane rating and that gives you three variables that you can play around with to help make more power so first of all being timing so you can advance the timing meaning you fire that spark plug sooner without worrying about knock or damaging the engine so you can have peak pressure occur at a more ideal time and as a result you can create more power it also means that because you're less likely to run into knock issues you can run more boost and you also have more flexibility with your air fuel ratio so if you're having problems with knock you're gonna have to run a really rich air fuel mixture which may not be ideal for power by having a higher octane rating you can choose that perfect air fuel ratio and create the maximum amount of power possible now if you're going to make a crazy amount of horsepower 1600 horsepower well you're going to need a ton of fuel so the koenigsegg jesco is the first production car to have not one not two but three fuel injectors per cylinder so plenty of fuel supplied there and so you have the two within the intake runner here mounted on a traditional fuel rail just like it's done with the aguera and then you have an additional fuel injector added to the intake plenum before each runner for each individual cylinder so you've got those three for each cylinder another reason for this so we have the difference between e85 and gasoline so e85 is less energy dense so pure ethanol 1.5 gallons of pure ethanol is the energy equivalent to one gallon of gasoline so we need quite a bit more fuel in order to produce the same amount of power and so that means we're dumping loads of fuel into this engine when we're running on e85 and we're creating 1600 horsepower but there are other benefits to having this additional fuel injector as well for example by injecting sooner it means that fuel has more time to mix with the air around it so better aeration and so you know think about those uh scenarios where you want to be efficient for example when you're at low rpm and low load where engines are traditionally quite inefficient by having that better aeration better air fuel mixture you're going to have more efficiency more complete combustion that's also going to help with cold starts giving that air you know giving that fuel and air more time to mix before it reaches the engine and you have that power stroke occurring so there are benefits for both a power standpoint obviously you need loads of fuel but also an efficiency standpoint having that cooled uh better mixed air from this injector that's injected into the plenum with plenty of time to mix before it enters in to the cylinder now as i mentioned some of the changes which they made to this engine were not necessarily about power but also about keeping this thing emission friendly and road legal and so they wanted to be efficient in all operating conditions they wanted to be able to meet emission regulations and that is why they changed the cylinder head design on this engine so they now have tumble flow intake ports so whereas previously you have that air coming in it kind of arcs in at a decent angle there wraps around that intake valve and then dumps within your combustion chamber now you have a kind of a changed pathway where you send that air in it goes over the top of that intake valve hits the other side and then tumbles in there so you're kind of creating a restriction in order to speed up that airflow and create this turbulent circle tumbling airflow right here which causes the air and fuel to mix really well and so at low rpm and low load conditions this really helps out with efficiency and so that's why this is done and so you know yes this may be better from a resistance standpoint for creating horsepower but this will enable this thing to you know keep the internal combustion engine alive and then you can compensate for the fact that perhaps you've made it more restrictive for that air to enter in well you can compensate with this for with boost of course using fuels like e85 things like that so there are ways to increase power and still allow for features like better efficiency at low rpm and low load so that you keep this engine chugging along using that tumble flow intake port also helps with cold starts so you have better mixing of the air and fuel and you don't have to have quite as rich of a mixture on cold startup in order to have consistent easy combustion now another fascinating change with this engine is that they've switched from a cross-plane crankshaft in the aguera over to a flat plane crankshaft here in the jesco and so i have a couple videos explaining this in detail and the advantages of each but we're going to get a little bit into uh coding specific scenario here so a cross plane crankshaft meaning your crank pins are 90 degrees apart so with you know four separate crank pins one crank pin for every two cylinders you'll have one it rotates 90 degrees you'll have another after rotating 90 degrees another after rotating 90 degrees and then you've got your 4 there and so with a flat plane crankshaft you rotate those crank pins instead of 90 degrees like with the cross plane it is a 180 degrees so instead of making like a plus sign if you were to look down it's just a straight line and so there's advantages to either scenario you know with this cross playing crankshaft they're generally smoother you can balance out the first order vibrations with heavy counterweights so the disadvantage that it's going to have a heavy crankshaft but it's going to be smooth as a result the secondary forces are balanced out again i explain all this in more detail and some other videos included in the video description versus the 180 degree the flat plane crankshaft the primary forces are balanced out so you have a lighter crankshaft overall but the secondary forces are not and so it does actually have more vibration as a result so you're able to get away with a lighter crankshaft and you're able to rev it up higher but you tend to have more vibration so in koenigsegg's example they are able to increase redline from 8250 up to 80 500 rpm here with the jesco so very cool and they claim that they have the lightest crankshaft for a v8 engine in production so just 12.5 kilograms for the crankshaft's weight very cool there that they've able to keep that weight so low and one of the reasons they were able to do this and still get away with you know not annoying the driver with those vibrations as they have active engine mounts and so those active engine mounts they actually used on the regera they did not on the aguera rs so when switching over to this engine uh they are able to tolerate a bit more vibration with those active engine mounts to compensate so that the driver isn't annoyed by the engine vibration and of course an additional benefit of doing this is that you even out those exhaust pulses which allows for better scavenging now if you have an engine that's making so much power over 300 horsepower per liter when running on e85 well you're gonna need giant turbo so the engine just has two turbos and that means just one turbo per cylinder bank which means if you want to hit those huge boost numbers create tons of power well you're going to need giant turbos now the unfortunate story is that giant turbos mean that you're going to have a high boost threshold meaning it's going to take a certain rpm with a certain amount of exhaust flow to actually get those turbos to start spooling and you're also going to have a lot of turbo lag so when you put your foot down asking for power and then it takes a while for those turbo chargers to spool up that lag can be annoying for the driver it's a downside you don't want turbo lag or these high boost thresholds and yet koenigsegg is somehow able to hit a thousand newton meters of torque at just 2700 rpm so what do they do so it's a very cool system it's actually somewhat similar to what volvo has done with a diesel engine where they have a 20 liter carbon fiber tank that has 20 bar pressure in it or about 290 psi of pressure so there's an electric air compressor that's compressing air and storing it in this carbon fiber tank so let's say you're at 20 2700 rpm and you put your foot down you want lots of power well what's going to happen is your two-row charger is way too big it's not able to spool up so what do they do well they take this compressed air this 20 bar pressurized air and they dump that into the exhaust there to spool up that turbo charger to help spool up the compressor side and then pull in air and give your engine plenty of boost very quickly so it eliminates both problems it means you can have boost at lower rpm and it gets rid of your turbo leg so a very cool solution and also you know there are different ways of doing this so koenigsegg looked at a few different options they said you know we could use quad turbo it could have four turbos or three turbos you have a smaller one that spools up first and then you use a larger turbo the reason why they ended up going with this system here is that it weighed less so they said this entire system carbon fiber tank electric air compressor weighs about seven to eight kilograms versus if they were to go with multiple turbos they'd be at least about 25 to 30 kilograms so a lighter system and it solves their problem uh with the boost threshold and with with the boost uh lag the lag in having that turbocharged spool up so very neat the implementation of that system and also it kind of serves a dual purpose so this is also another benefit of using this system of course they want this engine to be emissions friendly and one of the big problems with emissions is cold startups so that's when your catalytic converter is not yet heated up it's not performing the proper reactions in order to prevent harmful gases from escaping out the exhaust so you need to have that catalytic converter warm up very quickly so there's multiple things they do here one of them being injecting air into the exhaust there and that helps to speed up the process of heating up this catalytic converter so there's a couple ways that happens first of all by allowing by injecting that air into the exhaust you're introducing oxygen into the exhaust if there's any fuel remaining that means you can burn that air in fuel before it reaches the catalytic converter and help heat it up that way it also means you're providing oxygen for the catalytic converter which can use that oxygen for oxidation reactions within the catalytic converter which create heat on top of all of this they have an electric heater within the catalytic converter to also help warm it up once you're starting the car and finally we get to pressure sensors so this is the last feature we'll be discussing very cool they have a sensor which is measuring the pressure inside the cylinder and they claim that they're the first ones to get this to market in a production vehicle so this is also being done in mazda's skyactiv-x engine but of course that is not yet in production so they're claiming they're the first to the market with this very cool technology and why would you want to do this why would you want to measure pressure and how does that help you in any way well if you look at a graph of pressure versus time for your power stroke so you've got that compression stroke coming up it's pressurizing that air you see pressure start to rise and then you fire your spark plug uh and once you fire your spark plug your piston starts to move down that flame expands and you have this peak in pressure and so you want that peak and pressure to occur at the exact moment that gives you the maximum amount of work pushing that piston down and so there's a delay in time between when you fire the spark plug and when you reach that peak pressure and that delay in time changes it's not a constant interval and so by having a pressure sensor you're able to constantly monitor both of those things so the ecu is getting that information it's getting when did the spark fire and when did peak pressure occur and it can adjust when it should fire the spark in order to optimize where that peak pressure should have occurred of course you don't want peak pressure occurring before top dead center that means you're pushing the piston down when it's on its way up you don't want it occurring too late because if the piston's all the way down here then you're not getting that much useful work at it and if versus if you were to have that occur at the very top and push it all the way down with that peak pressure so it's very critical when peak pressure occurs and you're able to perfect to optimize that using a pressure sensor and then changing when do you fire the spark plug in order for that to be at the perfect time so it's great for efficiency and it's great for power both of which they are going for with this engine quite a neat design i probably said it's cool like a thousand times in this video i hope you all enjoyed watching thank you so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments of course feel free to leave those below
