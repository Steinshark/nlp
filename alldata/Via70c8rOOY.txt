ah man it's like dumb to do this at the end of the day after I'm like tired of and can't think anymore but no one watches you for a how you look be what you say it's just the physics that they care about well hopefully we'll get to the physics without messing it up let's rewind a bit in 2021 Tesla did something extraordinary 0 to 60 in 1.98 seconds in the model S plaid smashing all other production cars okay but with a caveat that was Motor Trends time with Tesla's support at Tesla's chosen track with a drag strip covered in glue and all of the cars temperatures and conditions set for the perfect run oh and deleting the first foot of rollout this Lucid air Sapphire matched that 1.98 second time exactly yes with the same sleazy first foot of rollout deleted but with two people in the car my bag of gear the air conditioning on the battery not preconditioned and on a public road surface no glue with just a few attempts made if you get closer to Tesla's conditions a prep surface with roll out my 0 to 60 time was 1.85 seconds that was my second attempt ever in the car in a car that had already run down the drag strip half a dozen times before I got into it that's 1300s quicker than the Tesla without ideal circumstances it's capable of even quicker despite lucid's public claim of 1.89 seconds hello everyone and welcome this is two Jason in one car Jason squared Jason squared so you used to work for motor TR now you sell car insurance for hagy is that I do not sell I am not licensed I am not allowed to talk about insurance I produce entertaining video content about cars to make you all fall in love with the name Hagerty and I think think what's interesting uh that the internet doesn't realize is like I think the number one misconception about you people probably don't think you're that smart but like truthfully you do know a lot about cars would you say that I think you can know a lot of things without being smart I mean I'm a smart no thank you I mean that was nice I mean he's a nice guy no supposed to be it was literally supposed to be a dig and that I'm saying most people think you're an idiot yeah but like you actually know a couple things about cars I try to I mean I listen I did three and a half years of mechanical engineering and I did four so not that much more right and I couldn't deal with all of the other mean Engineers I'm like I got to change my major because I can't deal with these people we're an awkward Bunch for sure we're socially inept and good-look yes yes we are um but yeah so I think like an engineer in a lot of ways but in a lot of ways uh act like an idiot well we are sitting inside of the Lucid air Sapphire it is the most powerful Lucid 1,234 if you have a trouble remembering it 1 two three which one's what was it after five okay 1 1,234 horsepower uh which is more than the previous most powerful Lucid which was 1,111 yes so you think that maybe Lucid just kind of made those numbers up it's somewhere in the ball sure yeah it's like close enough and they're like let's just say this cuz it's easier to remember now this one is yet somehow substantially way quicker than that 1111 was that too many ones maybe 11 one1 no you did four you pulled off an 8.9 something second quarter mile this morning oh thank you for bringing that up and what was your time in the quarter uh 9.04 9.04 so pretty impressive uh it can do an 8sec quarter mile so 8.9 5 was my time and my 0 to 60 with roll out uh which I don't believe in but I'm trying to find that the real raw data was 1.85 seconds so insanely quick now this is a prep surface um yeah and and that's with roll out so there there are some variables there but the car is insanely quick and the thing about this versus the 1111 Lucid air is we have three motors instead of two now why does that matter well if you if you look at just the peak horsepower output right 1 1111 to 1234 doesn't sound like much and that's obviously why Lucid didn't publish the Sapphire's horsepower number initially because that would lead you to believe that it's barely noticeable I mean realistically you shouldn't be able to notice that couple per but what happens is the standard car has two 600 horsepower and Motors uh they can't both get full power at the same time because the batter is limited to about 11-11 um and when you're on a Full Throttle launch you're using all of what the rear motor can do and maybe 2third of what the front motor can do because you have that weight transfer car leans back um and it's got more traction available at the back than 600 horsepower worth um so on a launch you're using 600 rear maybe 2 300 on the front is all I can put down yep and that's it so your traction limited up front in the GTP uh and you are power limited in the rear right with this car you are traction limited both in the front and the rear because they threw in another motor back there so there are three motors instead of two each capable of 600 horsepower you have a maximum of 1234 to work with which you can put wherever you want literally wherever you want up to 600 yes up to 600 at each at each motor which is like a really different strategy that that like we're not used to in cars because we're used to combustion engines we have one engine it's making one amount of power at that point and you can play tricks to put torque in different ways but you don't have three independent power sources so that's a pretty wild way of thinking like you have this pool of power in the battery and then how you distribute that pool of power is up to you know the software Engineers of this vehicle and it's like it's a really clever solution in a drag race of just sending way more to the rear and you get an insane launch 1.8 5 seconds with roll out and under 9 seconds uh in the quarter mile which is absurd this was my first time ever going under 10 seconds in the quarter were you on video when you I did I did record it yes I'll have it did you say things that you're not allow I didn't show profanities but here's the thing I daily drive a model 3 Performance and no like this is not the same thing but it's very quick a model 3 Performance is very quick you're hitting like8 gs9 GS pretty consistently versus this you know 1.3 or something like that 1.4 maybe uh peing so it's a it's definitely a jump but it's not like oh I've never felt that before I mean I haven't I Haven well I was going to say but but like you know at a certain point you're just like Bo you're thrown in your seat like it was it was definitely new to me and it was like Wow but I wasn't swearing I look the only car that I've ever driven that comes close to this is remat NAA okay I've never driven that the the fact that and that that was measurably quicker than this but I've never I'd never put instrumented testing numbers on that car but that was holy good yeah I can say that right yeah you can say whatever you want and the thing is I have a an audience of eight-year-olds so I edit it for them so the eight-year-olds can still watch okay so say whatever you want go yeah the NAA is unbelievable I it's really scarcely believably fast yes the crazy thing about this car is it's a packaging Miracle right it is a packaging miracle and it's this Ultra smooth ultra quiet rides really well ridiculously spacious luxury car that can effectively keep up oh my God it was four wheels burning there was a four-wheel rolling burnout 35 mph it's it's the fact that this doesn't compromise anywhere that makes it so unique yeah and also like the drop off is like so again I don't want to be like oh a model 3 Performance is similar because it's not yeah like you have an initial punch of acceleration it's not nearly as hard and then the drop off is way way quicker 60 MPH after it's just like it's not quite there anymore this is pulling 156 mph in the quarter which was like it's still hauling as you're going down then 156 at Sonoma which is uphill and almost always into a headwind I mean that is nuts only true professionals could get it into the eights yeah a apparently I got a 1 187 0 to 60 I think it was it's the easily the fastest 0 to 60 I've ever experienced with any measuring devices um it did it again and again and again I mean we had what eight journalists each getting two runs and it just they were the slowest of them all was 9.05 right I mean it's just for an hour 9.05 again and again again again again just nuts one of the cool things about Vehicles like this when you have this much power and you're kind of at certain theoretical limits of like modern capabilities is 0 to 60 versus 60 to 0 and you've actually done a video on this it's a really interesting position of you know what should be quicker a 0 to 60 or a 60 to0 and with almost every single production car that's ever existed the 60 to zero braking is better than the acceleration and this is one of those few cars that can actually switch that yeah now do you know why well two things number one you're looking at weight distribution right so when you're on full braking you have a lot of weight transfer forward and at full acceleration you have a lot of weight transfer rearward and so you got larger tires rear in some cars so something like a Porsche 9911 has such great braking performance because it's got so much R weight in the in the rear that it can take advantage of the rear wheels under braking more so than a front engine car can um so almost always you have braking you have Tire grip that can be maxed out at all four corners at maybe let's say 10 times a second so 10 times a second the ABS unit can lock and unlock each one of those wheels so they're effectively at or near their Max continuously no cars effectively prior to the last couple years have had the ability to overwhelm all four tires from 0 to 60 the whole way and certainly not the ability to modulate the the engine's output so on an internal combustion engine like you said you have one power source yep but the your ability to cut power and add power back in even on something with that's naturally aspirated with independent throttle bodies and modern by injector you know B cylinder injected so it can cut power limit power to one cylinder at a time that makes those noises you're still looking at on the order of once or twice a second to be able to add power once you've cut it back if it's turbocharged you're looking at way slower than that cuz you're waiting for Boost to build back up Lucid did this stability and traction control internally and I know this because they told it to me but also when I did the video with that prototype Sapphire they wrote the traction control software on site yeah they had arrived they did a four-wheel burn out they started typing numbers they're like this is what traction is let's optimize it for this exact scenario and they they programmed a certain amount to real slip in and just went for it and just kept going until they beat the Plaid effectively and then we called that number good and that was what we what we went with and of course now they've had another year to work on but that system operates at 1,000 Hertz which means what's a Hertz this bam that hurts that hurts it is cycles per second yes a thousand times per second you can adjust the torque output of the motor which is extraordinary now I asked them about this though in like in reality how many adjustments do you get abs versus traction control I was talking with their uh traction control and Dynamics Team and they were saying in reality once you consider you know you have you have a a tire right it's not just this thing that can handle a th adjustments per second once you get from that tire back to the electric motor and back and you have all this feedback loop you get about 25 adjustments per second based on reacting to whatever that tire is doing with traction control with abs in reality you get somewhere about two adjustments based on what you're reacting to per second so think about that I mean it's over an order of magnitude more adjustments per second to optimize based on what you're driving on so that's just insane and so as a result it means you can go this way faster than you can go this way yeah well the other thing remember so braking has one other Advantage which is that it has control of all four wheels yes this car only has control over three wheels right so it can have wheel spin on one front wheel and not the other so you there could be a situation where under acceleration you're maxing out one of the front wheels and not the other but in reality this has got to accelerate faster than and also you could have a slight help with aerodynamic drag in braking this is a very aerodynamic vehicle so it's not that big of a roll especially at low speeds like 60 to Z yeah it's insane it is disorienting so when we first tested sorry to refer back to that video but we first tested uh Tesla is this just a plug for your video the whole time I'm trying to illust you're allowed to plug your own stuff if you want to call it that oh I'm not calling that I'm not going to use that word Jason you have eight-year-olds watching this how dare you um no but it was very interesting Randy popes who we work with a lot Seca Hall of Fame race car driver we work with him because he's safe he's consistent he doesn't ever wreck cars also sell car insurance uh he does not sell car insurance but he is unbelievably fast and consistent and he's fnny and all the rest of the stuff that that we love Randy got out of the Tesla plaid and thought the car had no brakes and the reason he it wasn't a capacity issue he just said it's got no brake bite and it doesn't slow down in fact it doesn't have a good brake bite or didn't at the time but it does slow at the same rate as like an m5cs which we had on on on uh on hand at the same time you are so used to a car being able to break so much harder than it can accelerate that that's the real danger of a car like this is it accelerates harder than it braks and that makes you think oh there's no brakes well no brakes because it's pulling a g in a straight line of acceleration yes and they are heavy like to to ry's Credit in saying like oh it doesn't have braks it's like it is potential that you could get into a scenario if you keep doing these laps that you get these brakes very hot because they are very heavy in this case it's got carbon Ceramics they're massive it can handle you know track driving um but if you're on steel brakes and they're slightly under sized like yeah you get one good you know 70 to Z whatever it is but if you keep doing that you can get the you're you're you know you're dispensing that much power you're which means the battery and the motor and everything else is going to be be generating a ton of heat plus but it has the ability to cool itself your brakes don't have ac lines going to it yes and so we did three I did three really what I would call eight to 9/10 laps in of Laguna sea in this car and the brakes were fragrant um but they held up perfectly is that healthy for your lungs yes it's well it's carbon it's what we're made out of hey exhaling carbon is how uh you get rid of your body's Mass it's what people think it's pooping it's not pooping it's breathing it is actually breathing you're right that's why you're so thin he's sitting over there I'm over there like panting like always like when I'm off camera I'm just exhaling only exhaling so here's a question I'm genuinely curious if you know the answer to so it's quizzing uh you at this moment no pressure oh God why are the quickest EVS the heaviest EVS weight is the enemy of all performance but it really isn't because you can make up for weight with power right so it's the enemy of long-term performance because you're going to wear tires and all the rest of the stuff but more more weight is more grip and we these cars are all grip limited so you you put a huge battery that can deliver an enormous amount of energy quickly and then you have big motors and you manage the weight transfer and so ultimately you get a faster launch than something that's lighter okay so I feel like it's a fine Theory um you're super wrong no you're not you're not that wrong I'm here's here's no it's a fun question so the challenge with EVS just like this Lucid okay we have a 600 horsepower motor we have two 600 horsepower motors in the back that's 1,800 horsepower but this car doesn't have 1,800 horsepower why not because it's by the battery it's limited by the battery so that is the answer that is why the fastest EVS are the heaviest because in order to be very fast you need a lot of power and in order to have a lot of power you need a massive battery and so with having a massive battery you have a larger discharge rate so in other words like what percentage of that battery's juice can you throw out at any one given moment if you have one battery cell just one right the thing's not going to be quick if you have this much oh if you have this much gasoline left in your Shelby GT350 you still have all the power right and so the thing is with electric cars is you must have a massive battery in order for them to be quick and that's like the sad reality of today so all the quickest EVS weigh an insane amount in order to get that Peak Power number high but there is no penalty to weight right well the penalty to weit isn't that great like like tires today are such that 4,000 lb 3,000 lb they don't care for a brief amount of time right okay for a brief amount of time for a long you did a video on that didn't absolutely yeah so I think it's just really interesting that like we we put ourselves in this situation where the car has to be heavy because it has to have a battery now there are such things as power cells and energy cells and this has energy cells right so they're going for a lot of energy in a smaller amount of space so that this thing has 417 miles of range or whatever the stated claim is if they wanted they could go with power cells and give it more power and just give you less range so there there is a trade-off there things like the Chevy uh volt actually had like pretty good power cells so it could get high output with a small battery but it's an interesting thing to think about right this the Lucid was making the battery packs for Formula E for example yes and they had a very small capacity but could discharge that very very quickly so they were relatively light okay I think I probably know the answer after watching you just Hoon around in a parking lot and make an extraordinary amount of smoke and destroy the tires but what would you say is your favorite thing about the Lucid air Sapphire it's actually not speed so I know that it's not the burnouts it's not the burnouts it's not when you got out of the car yeah no that was awesome that was completely awesome but it's one thing to have a lot of power and be how do I say this to be nice to Tesla absolutely horrendous at chassis tuning the The Plaid is one of the worst cars I've driven in terms of chassis tuning right driven in I got in and spun it immediately and I don't like I act like an idiot for film and do that but I don't spin cars unless I'm trying to do that on you're a pretty good driver I I tried to be and I when you don't have much going for you you got to stick to something something's got to work right I mean something I tried to myself and it just didn't work no you know I should never get in a car turn everything off and spin it on the first corner and I did and there was no steering wheel I thought there was a wheel because the steering wheel was super annoying I did drive the model X with that and it was and the car scared the devil out of Randy it just it's not good this is and I'm going to make a very big statement here the best handling passenger car ever made and passenger car I mean let's let's ignore that's a statement that's for sure a statement it's a statement but it does you know like there's a 9911 GT3 RS in there kind it's not really a passenger car right this is a saying like four doors or you're just saying Passenger cars it could be four anything that seats four people put it that way right so anything that's meant for transportation I genuinely don't think I've ever driven anything that follows driver's wishes so the the big my favorite part about this car is it seems to have a complete understanding based on my inputs inputs of what I want and then it does things to make that happen even when they violate the laws of physics yes and so one of the things we haven't touched on with with two Motors in the back is that I can be requesting let's say 1% of power right let's say I'm requesting 100 horsepower to cruise at 80 mph I or I could be requesting zero zero power at all but the computer can apply 600 horsepower to one rear wheel and 600 horsepower worth of drag to the other that'd be an extreme example extreme example but you you'd be driving straight ahead and the steering wheel wouldn't go and you would go in into low earth orbit yes so the the car and its computers and those Motors can change the direction of the car without you moving steering wheel the best example I can give of torque vectoring is I did years ago in Motor Trend was a wheelchair wheelchair doesn't have a steering wheel but you can you can turn yes this car's torque vectoring is so perfectly tuned that it was always neutral no matter what I did if I was surprised so I'm not that great of a driver so I don't like giving like very finite detail about like a driving but I was surprised on track how neutral it behaved and I kept it in full everything literally full everything and it was still playful it would still get a little sideways and what was really interesting is the first time I felt the back kicking out it's like instinctively I correct with the steering wheel the second time I was like oo I could feel it when I corrected that it was actually messing around with the motors so the second time it did I said I'm just going to leave it I'm going to keep my hands where they are and keep my foot down and it figures it out with the motors your steering angle so it was like wow it corrected what I was asking it to do without me doing anything and then I turned it off I had everything fully fully off um and at the at with permission and it is daddy said it was okay Daddy said it was okay it it's actually a little bit difficult to control there's no question this car would be faster on a racetrack in track mode because then it's easy to manage it's brilliant but then when you turn everything off it becomes a complete and total hooligan but it doesn't bite and so that it's understood track mode is a step below everything off track mode actually does have an assistance and they even said themselves it it tends to be the case where track mode will be the fastest oh there's no question I was so much faster in track mode because you're managing the back of the car in with everything off so every time you give throttle it's doing everything it can to get you to no steering to a four-wheel drift but it didn't bite I mean I and the other the thing is it can it do it can change things under breaking so I came in there's a chicane that's a 90° right and then a 90° left and I came in a bit too fast probably 15 M hour fast which is bad um and so I i' I'm under abs and I thought okay well I can just go straight across the dirt or I can just flick it sideways and see what happens so I did a Scandinavian flick so left and then right and it got the car beautifully sideways under ABS which is difficult to do and then in the middle of it I flicked it back the other way gave it g and turned it into a power slide that needed this much opposite lock and just laid four tires on the way out of there it was genuinely picture perfect and I looked like a hero but it was the car doing it actually I described it the same way and that it and that I felt full everything on mode was also hero mode and that like I could be an idiot cuz that's what I intentionally did I was like I am an idiot yes however in this moment I was intentionally not giving it the steering correction and it would just figure it out and it's like oh that's so easy but it's not boring no it's not it's not there's still drama it has drama which was like wow yeah how's it possible that something that's perfectly silent should probably floor it on this stop sign and how could something that makes no noise have have drama Jes it just doesn't ow you imagine like being an Uber driver and just not having your passengers have any idea what this thing is capable of kind of understated yeah I need to do that as like a as a secret like hidden camera thing and just watch people pass out all right I don't even know what you said your favorite thing was uh just handling handling okay my favorite thing is like it is a packaging Marvel so much so that I have an entire video dedicated to explaining the cool packaging of it so if you'd like to check it out you should all right biggest drawback biggest complaint of this car to you it was the was the it was the flashers wasn't it the hazard lights let me when when a company spends billions of dollars and I don't even know hundreds of thousands of man hours making a product right there are so many things that could go wrong we are I am you are to as well a Critic right we're there to criticize things so it's easy I'm an attractive internet personality oh okay well I'm just that's what I tell my family oh do they are they believing you yet they told me I was attractive they were the ones that said it it wasn't me not my words um it's my job to be a Critic right it's my job to tell you this is what's good but this is bad and the bad things are always what I see first it's easy to look past a good ride right you're always noticing what you're what you're yes seeing instead of what you're missing right the this when I came in from the dynamic evaluation on the track I had two things to say one was I would really like a little bit more uh travel from the steering wheel I wanted a little closer to me um and that'll give it like a quarter of a demerit point the biggest problem with this car genuinely the biggest problem is that the display for the emergency flashers got out of sync left to right I'll I'll give you the I'll air drop the video to you so you can put it in here but it's like goodink good dink good Dink and it's such a stupid little thing that would tell a potential customer they have not had ATT 50,000 well they just the company that did this car didn't have that attention to detail and is so not the case yeah it's true actually there's an extraordinary amount of attention to detail in this I this that prototype almost a year ago and this is just now done they have spent a year taking a car that was spectacular and making it vicelessgames General trend of EVS of like put everything into an infotainment system behind the screen and like you have to figure it out every time and there are certain things that like you will feel are right for you that is just not what the designer thinks and so you end up messing around with these screens and you get really frustrated and it's like there are so many simple things of like adjusting mirrors adjusting steering wheel uh you know turning on your windshield wipers that kind of thing where you're used to it because you've driven this thing that's a certain way and I don't like to believe that like things shouldn't change I just think that like certain things should change for the better not just change for the S of change yes it's like okay it's simpler to not have a button and it's like well that's true but is it really annoying to not have a button I'm with you I think that I mean I'm sort of was half joking about the turn signal thing it does give you the impression that there was an attention to detail but really this car's biggest problem is and always has been the infotainment system it's unnecessarily complicated even just moving a mirror which you point it out you do once yeah but I don't want it to be irritating I don't want the system to be slow to load I don't want to have to wait through menus to do things that the other thing is like it'll show dual maps and so you'll have Maps here and Maps here and you're like okay well why do I need maps on both at any point like if you're using carplay or something like that like you just want it to be one does one thing the other does the other thing and not synced so for some reason they're both syn there well the idea was that you should be able to swipe things up and down I think if I remember correctly but in practice what works best in screens and cars is things never move like I want the same the controls like a real button to never move which reduces the benefit of the spring the screen in the first place which is why just put buttons in the car um ffs but yeah the the infotainment is less than perfect but that's the case for almost everything yes in in 2023 and 2024 model years yes it is a very frustrating time but I would say like Tesla doesn't have as big of an internal like just resistance towards figuring it out initially I feel like they've done I I cannot stand the fact that they got rid of stocks and they're putting turn signals on a steering wheel and they're removing even more features than they have but I feel like their interface itself actually works pretty well I agree I agree the the lack of stocks is just stupidity right and this is just e that's cost-saving obviously or it's Elon Ag and nothing against Elon but elon's not a car guy in the same way that I am or you are look he's made this company that has just changed the world and I think that's amazing but anyone who's a real driver would never put a you have to bleep that one out no one as a driver would put a a yoke in a car and no one's a driver I mean it was stupidly Ferrari did those those freaking turn signals on the wheel and they're just not better and I I just I'm I'm sorry they they Tesla's going down crazy hole crazy land in a lot of ways okay speaking of crazy hole Tesla we're on the subject $250,000 is the price tag for the car we are sitting in a Tesla Model plaid which you could argue is like the closest competitor from like on paper these things look similarish is $90,000 that's unbelievable it is their price point is unbelievable so I guess my question is does the price tag for this make sense and then followup does it make sense in context of a Tesla Model S plaid uh yeah it absolutely makes sense because the model S plaid is a on trick pony it is a really fast car that's very efficient um and it's it's a very good car in a lot of ways but there is no contest that's like saying I'm trying to think that's like saying well a Hellcat can do it also has a th000 horsepower right I mean but you want to compare a Hellcat and a 911 G you saying something so good yeah you it's it's like comparing a Hellcat and a GT3 RS right there's a there's a finesse to the Porsche 911 GT3 that makes it a well-rounded spectacular driver's car that's missing from hcat look I love like give me a charger widebody Scat Pack any day like I love a big dumb rear wheel drive happy car but you you're not comparing them just based on speed and comparing this and a Model S just because they both are fast is disen it's my opic you're just looking on and and like I'm not trying to take sides with Tesla here but do you think it is worth you know two and a half times cuz that's a huge jump is it worth let me ask it a different way is a BGA worth two times what an Audi Q7 no no I'm too pragmatic for this discussion like in the beginning this is the problem we're both pragmatic and that's why I want to say no yes but there is like a pragmatic explanation in that like Tesla has serious volume right now and Lucid is this fresh new company with this fresh new idea with their own take on it and you know they don't have volume so if they don't have volume the price cannot be competitive at this point so there is so much care there is so much care that goes into a single product the Lucid air which is like really beautiful to see in the engineering world because it's like they feel like to me an example of where engineering wins Above All Else Like engineering is King everything else like will fall into place maybe but but they don't care about that they care about the engineering and it like must be perfect it must be as good and as close to perfect as we can get and so they do all these little steps to get there and I find it extremely admirable and I think the unfortunate side is you can then take this simplistic view of say well $90,000 I can buy this and it's like ah you can I mean you really can but but like it's so much more respectful to me like what they have done with this listen nothing against Tesla the Tesla Chang world but Model S is an old old car now and it had a lot of compromises baked in initially but it's still it evolved the state of the automobile without question yes hats off to Tesla for doing that and for now making something that can do 0 60 2 seconds unbelievable however Lucid has in my mind taken all of the best attributes of lotus Mercedes-Benz Porsche jaguar and combine them all into one car that is purely engineering lead so from a from an engineering perspective from a driver perspective from an ownership perspective this car changes the game from a business perspective I'm worried yeah no same because I feel like I only think like an engineer and the world constantly reminds me why that process is wrong it's flawed right yes like you cannot have this mentality and and and always be successful right so I worry about that because like I love the mentality behind this car I don't know if it works long term because I don't know if enough people care about those differences from 90k to 250k here's the light at the end of that tunnel Mercedes current reputation right Mercedes had a great reputation for years and years and years and it was absolutely cemented in the 80s so the 1980s Mercedes R&D budget was orders of magnitude greater than anyone else and so you had cars like the w201 which is the 190e with that had a five link rear suspension that was the world's first and it's still in use today right I mean this car is that car became the also the 124 E-class and all of the technology just absolutely shifted gears and Mercedes were outrageously expensive yes and you adjust it for inflation a 190 a 4cylinder 190 with a manual and and crank Windows was you know on the order of $50,000 today so they were they were selling in Bentley numbers by today's comparison but they was engineering Le Lexus came along and destroyed that because Lexus was able to do 90% as good of a product or sometimes even better for half the price or a third of the price Lucid has is carving its reputation with cars like this right this is genuinely top five best cars on the planet of all time I think from an engineering perspective and so many other perspectives that will translate into sales of less expensive cars provided that lucid last long enough financially in business yes to be able to do that and so every time I talk to anyone of the chassis guys or anyone from Lucid I'm like this is amazing and I love that you're doing it but stop please and concentrate on like the gravity SUV or other Mass market products so that you'll you'll have the income to to to play to to play but they really do have to prove their metal and this thing it's done it's over Lucid has replaced Mercedes-Benz as the the maker of the best engineered cars in the world wow that's that's a great stopping point honestly and I think I don't I don't have anything to disagree with that I mean I think it's absolutely incredible I think there are two videos worth checking out if you haven't yet seen them one is your drag race which you probably have seen of this versus the very pretentious way that you say bugatti what's the next word what would you call it I I'd just be like an American I'd be like it's a shiron a shiron so you should watch Jason's video which I'll have a link to of the shiron versus now we're in the Lucid Sapphire lucid sapphir safiri fairy okay you that's one of them the other one is Savage geese recently put out an hour and a half video on the engineering of this car with interviews of so much of the Lucid team was a good video it's a great video it's very worth watching you should check out both I'll have links you should also check out I'm sorry to say the drag race video was fun and all but my icons episode video on this car because it really explains where Lucid came from as a company but wasn't that video with a rear single rear the original Dream Edition but the the point is that this is not Tesla Model S 2.0 the company itself is Tesla 2.0 because it's all of the talent from Tesla taking everything they learned and saying not how do we make a new another car it's how do we build another company from the ground up with all of the lessons we learned and without let's call it the eccentricities of Elon um well I may or may not include the link to that video but I'll definitely include the links to the other videos thank you all so much for watching if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below thank you for having me
