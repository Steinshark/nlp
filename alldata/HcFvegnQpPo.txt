[wind noises] Ok, I'm trying to find this line and I can
see there's like a dip where the pass goes around here and the line looks like it's just
on the far side of a fence which is the top of this hill here we go okay it's basically on the other side of this
gate I think it might be on the other side of that
field I think we'll come up the wrong side I think it's that gate that gate over there
yeah that is definitely it that's it they're right there we got this okay it's right before the diagonal path merges
with a path we're on and I would say it's here yeah yes right right here there are three
different definitions of North you've got True North you've got magnetic north and you've
got grid North and for the first time ever all three of them have aligned in the UK at
exactly the same place and that place is here as of November in the year 2022 they did a
line just out there in the ocean but the pointers moved it's currently here it's going to keep
going that way and it will pop out the other side in Scotland around July 2026. now there's the obvious question why is this
point moving around but before we deal with that I'm gonna find somewhere less windy probably
dangerously on the cliff somewhere and we're going to look at why we have three different
Norths ah okay True North as it says best North if you've
got a spherical spinning object and I like to carry a prop with me to demonstrate a sphere
it is my head uh that North there it is right there now the planet is on an angle and it
spins but that Center of rotation is the top of the planet it's it's the top it's the same
distance from the equator in every direction it is North there's no arguing with true north
however grid North is what you get on a map so this
is an OS map the Ordnance survey have been mapping the United Kingdom since the late
1700s and they sell these fantastic maps and I love rambling it's a great hobby my wife
and I go on walking holidays own a lot of these maps and yes they have an app but that's
just recreating the experience of having a physical bit of paper a big rectangle big
square of paper and you use a compass to navigate around it and on this they like to put a grid
the issue is True North makes for an awful awful grid but to explain that like I'm going
to live with you here it's been raining a lot on the walk over the wind is freezing
cold and if I know future Matt like I think I know a future Matt on the way home future
Matt's gonna go to a pub for a warm drink probably a pub with a hilarious maths name
so I'm gonna hand over the explanation for what grid is used on a map to Future map oh yeah I found a pub it's super warm and
it's called the square Encompass so good if you ever endorse it I highly recommend coming
along they have an incredible range of both beers and and crisps chips if you're Americans
but anyway I brought this myself this is not available in the pub this is my spherical
chalkboard I think none of us should be surprised I have one of these it's actually my wife's
she uses it for drawing uh like she's a solar physicist and so she's all solar configurations
on this let me borrow it so I can demonstrate that if you've got your equator kind of down
here that's the equator line and then I draw in this line of longitude so I'm going from
the equator down here all the way up to the true north that circle at the very top up
there and then let's say I'm a map maker and I'm like oh I definitely want to have this
bit on my mat and I want to have the next grid line over so I'm going to draw in the
next line of longitude over oops over there there we go and then of course they meet at
the top if they start a part of the Equator and they meet at the top they've got to get
closer together as they go up so your map maker comes along it's going to stay there
excellent and they're going to make their map on a flat flat surface and they start
by putting in their central line so they're like this is the beginning of my grid right
down the center there there we go look at that first line of the grid so far so good
and actually we can line that up really nicely so file out the bottom of this one with the
bottom of that one and then I curl it up I can perfectly match that line at the Top If
I tip it right forward I can put that there no problem and if you've got a flat surface
you can absolutely curl it in that one dimension no problem you're like well I need to do the
other line now so actually the other line it starts there so you know what I'll just
very quickly put in the next line of migration starts there I'm going to run it parallel
as a map maker I really just kind of feel it Go by eye I feel like that's that's pretty
parallel so then you're like oh amazing right so I pop those down there look at that line
up with the two lines no worries this Center one goes all the way up and look at this way
off it's all the way I mean I'm covering a decent percentage of the globe right so it's
even past the line after the next one the whatever the case we can agree this line should
be over here should be there and it's ended up over here and if I did do it there I'll
add that in as a dotted line if I if I break this uh it's going to be a real awkward conversation
when I get home so there we are so that's so if I actually followed True North this
is what my grid would be doing it would be narrowing in so that's not desirable so it
turns out because of the nature of taking a 2d surface mapping it on to a 3D sphere
you can pick one line to line up perfectly and the rest are going to be a bit off so
when the OS Maps were working out their Maps they're like well we could use Greenwich on
the Zero line of longitude but instead we're going to go with two degrees west and that's
because it's kind of the closest whole line of longitude so an integer value of longitude
that's as Central as possible and because the further out you go the worse the alignment
of True North to grid North becomes you want to minimize that distance and so two degrees
longitude is like the minimal value of the maximum error you're going to get in the UK
and so that's why uh past mat is on the two degree line of longitude right now even as
we speak back to you past Matt yep still here still cold been waiting the whole time and
I am on that two degree line of longitude however if I wanted to go to the three degree
line it's just over 70 kilometers in that direction and the one degree line is just
over 70 kilometers in that direction however by the time you get up uh north of Aberdeen
uh up in Scotland where this line leaves the UK at that point it's under 60 kilometers
between the lines of longitude so if you use True North to do your grid by the time you
get up there you've got 84 a bit of 84 percent as much land between each pair of lines you
effectively Zoomed In by about 19 and that changes gradually As you move up and the target
mirror these people they like their scales they're going to get real upset if the scale
is changing the only good thing to be said about grid North compared to True North is
that once you compensate for that correction like you know how far you are from two degrees
you work out how far you've got to change it stays the same if you're there at any point
in the past or future it's always the same correction it doesn't move around unlike magnetic north is the worst but it's real
easy to measure you just need a compass get yourself a Shiny Rock with some other properties
let it suspend and It'll point to North so even though it's a bad North it's really easy
to measure and the reasons it's bad is it moves around which is why we're gonna get
this freak alignment magnetic north is moving which means it's going to line up with the
other two however I said right at the beginning that this Confluence of North by North North
is moving up the line of two degrees longitude you think well hang on if magnetic north has
moved to line up with the other two it should line up the whole weight I mean that's just
the direction of north but that's not how magnetic north works it's even worse than
that it's not just that it moves around it's not just that the self-magnetic pole can't
even have the decency to be in Antarctica they're shooting all over the place but the
lines themselves aren't straight I mean this whole planet is just a sloshy mess speaking
of which Back to Future Matt in the pub magnetic fields are a mess and a compass is not a smart
device all it can do is orientate itself with whatever the local fields are and if there's
nothing else in the way that's great but if I bring my phone over and here I've actually
got my compass app running so I'm like oh you know what I want to verify analog with
digital if I bring the two together suddenly the analog moves around because there are
magnets in my phone it's changing the local magnetic field now it's coming back and now
it's going wrong again so the compass just shows you whatever is happening in the local
magnetic environment and the Earth is not one perfectly neat magnet it's not like the
lines come out of the top are perfectly straight and go in the bottom oh no they go all over
the shop the lines are going this is where the lines are going that way I actually downloaded
from uh the department Noah from the US government this is a 3D 3D model of the Earth uh actually
they give it as a flat model I've mapped it onto a sphere because please flat models so
I've taken their data put it onto this sphere and I can drag it around and so the lines
are showing you now they're showing you how far off your compass is but they're not showing
you how far off your compass is from where the field should be pointing where magnetic
north is because that's all over the place if you look at the moment magnetic north at
the top here is like over here somewhere oh no there it is is it over there near Alaska
I think if you look at the southern south there it is it's over there like it's not
even in Antarctica I don't know I bring it up a lot really bugs me I feel like someone
should look into that however uh the magnetic poles move all over the place and this is
not showing you where they should be it's showing you the difference between the wonky
local field which we call the declination of the Earth's magnetic field and true north
so it's just showing you how far off by accident the magnetic field is compared to where you
care about and you've either got the red lines that's where it's pointing I think too much
to the east you've got the blue areas where it's pointing too much to the west and because
of the intermediate value theorem you've got the green zone that's where it's perfect doesn't
mean it's pointing in the right direction it just means that the magnetic field is messed
up in a way that it accidentally compensates for the difference between the magnetic north
and the true north and if you look at these lines there's one that goes from the South
Pole through Western Australia up to the North Pole there's another one that starts at the
North Pole comes down then goes back up again and look at that it goes right or zoomed in
too much there it goes through the UK so this data is from 2019 and you can see at that
point it went pretty much through London so if you're in London and you've got your compass
out just because of the mess of the magnetic field it would accidentally Point towards
True North you didn't have to correct for it and that green line that line of accidentally
don't need to fix anything is moving to the west and as you can see it's not a bit of
a tilt and if you're moving a line it's on a bit of a tilt so here I've got our original
perfect line from my map and let's say this ruler is the the zone of no correction if
I gradually Slide the zone of no correction across and you follow where it intersects
with the only line where grid North equals True North it looks like it's moving North
up that line but that's just because the line of zero correction is on an angle and it's
moving from the East towards the west and that's why that point is moving gradually
up that line so there you are at this one particular point in time there's one specific
spot I can look at my map and grid North is that way True North is that way magnetic north
is that where they all line up well if I hold everything still they all line up perfectly
in that I think my compass there it goes it's rotating very slowly to point in the correct
direction I'm so excited and it's going to move across the UK going through such hot
spots as Birmingham probably other places as well we'll put them on the screen system the m62 motorway Barrack upon Tweed Aberdeen
Fraser Bird go and check him out eventually it goes out The Far Side just north of Aberdeen
place called fraserburgh we think roughly July 2026 if you're planning ahead for that
party um but the Earth is a sloshy mess so who knows but what an incredible alignment
I'm so glad I'm here absolutely worth being this freezing cold and Windswept if you excuse
me I have a future mat to go and become thank you so much for watching this video where
I've tracked all the way to the edge of a cliff to talk about three Norths all at the
same point and don't forget to like And subscribe hey look I didn't come all the way here in
the wind and rain for future Matt to do the wrap up in the pub I'm in the past I've earned
this I am the pain before that gain I know time is an illusion but rain is very much
not so if you don't mind although you do make a good point Please Subscribe we don't ask
very often and it would be nice if you could subscribe support the channel like as well
I guess do all those things you got to do it'll be great I'm sorry we interrupted if
there's anything any of us can do to make it up to you actually there is one thing that
will make me feel a lot better if everyone could subscribe
