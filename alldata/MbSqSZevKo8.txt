I am going to blow up this power supply with the tester behind me in fact if all goes according to plan I'm going to be blowing up a lot of power supplies that's right it's time for another lab update and this time we have got the goods I'm talking finished metal 3D prints Machine Vision automated game benchmarking and a special room to host my own legally dubious 5G Network why would I spend all this money in Risk prison time you ask for science now the clever among you probably noticed that this was the first big piece of equipment we purchased and it's taken us a pretty long time to get it running what's the deal with that well there's a couple reasons first we needed an adequate power hookup then we needed an appropriate oscilloscope actually we'd still need an oscilloscope we'll get to that in a moment finally we needed someone as knowledgeable about Electronics as he is tall that's where this guy comes in because I mean who knows what would happen if I came over here and twisted this style or pushed this button or wait what does this one do Segway sponsor the ridge upgrade your everyday carry with the ridge wallet it's RFID blocking technology protects your cards from digital theft while its durable materials ensure it lasts for years to come even once the apocalypse starts click the link below and use code Linus to save 10 off your purchase and get free shipping and we're back what you're looking at is every harness coming off of the power supply connected through these wagos to our power supply tester now the reason that we can't just twist them together for our testing is that we also need the sense wires that are also running back to our power supply tester so that we can see what voltages those rails are actually running at because spoiler alert 3.35 12 yeah in your dreams Premiere more like 12.34 actually the five volts really close 3.3 is a little low these are all well within spec though but we aren't drawing any power from it yet let's see what happens when we change that sitch I guess we are drawing a little bit like I don't know 40 Watts or 50 Watts or something like that give me 150 watts wait 150 on the 5 volt rail are you mad wait oh this is a really old power supply 22 amps on the 5 volt rail whew should I be touching this it's shut off like that was it it's gone already I thought I only asked for 150 watts well hey that means the overcurrent protection worked though we tried to draw a 150 watts on a rail that's only rated for 110 and it was like no okay so you got 50 Watts on the 12 volt rail okay how about 100 Watts oh my God it's off again okay we're at 65 Watts can't believe you've done this you know this was a very sentimental power supply for me I've had it since before you were born you can tell by looking at it I've seen comments questioning if we need such a fancy tester and the truth is guys if all we want is to test basic over current protection circuits or to see if it just immediately fails when we try to draw power from it the answer is no but we don't want to stop at complete garbage and well seems safe enough good luck we want to put real pressure on manufacturers and in order to do that we needed to close the gap between the professional gear that's used to design these products and the hobbyist level equipment that many Tech media Outlets have been stuck with so in order to do that we got some help from reputable manufacturers see Sonic helped us spec this unit to begin with and Johnny from Corsair AKA The One and Only Johnny Guru gave us some tips on how to best use it we've also recently just completed our on-site training from chroma and every component in this stack plays an important role starting at the bottom where you'll find our AC power supply that's this guy right here this can not only Supply an ample amount of power but it can also simulate a variety of distortions which will allow us to test a power supplies behavior during non-ideal conditions such as during a brown note this feeds into our big switch as we call it which I've just been informed is completely redundant the AC Source can also turn the power on and off so why we need an on off controller I don't know and that okay then we have our DC Supply which is used to supply additional DC power to our over voltage protection slash short circuit testing device above the desk thing we've got the jack-in panel this allows us to plug AC power into our power supply and then also plug our power supply into all the diagnostic equipment here including our timing and noise analyzer as well as our programmable loads these can be adjusted to simulate any kind of device you want though obviously we are most interested in creating loads that will behave like a PC why do we need so many of them you might ask well each of these can pull about 400 watts so say we wanted to test a 1500 watt power supply a 2000 watt power supply we would need a lot more than one of them it's also really helpful for testing multi-rail designs now a really cool aspect of programmable loads is that they can simulate the behavior of real components like the big transient spikes that made the 3090 ti so famous finally at the top we've got our multimeter and power meter which give us all sorts of information about our circuit and would plug into our oscilloscope if I had one seriously it's in the mail already and the first video we're planning is a budget power supply Roundup does anyone actually make a sub 40 power supply you can trust speaking of trust the Telecommunications industry am I right we're gonna get it there behind me is our new EMC chamber Electronics go in no electromagnetic radiation gets in or out that means we can put whatever we want in here and cut it off completely from the outside world we can test Wi-Fi we can test 5G we can test Bluetooth within this chamber we could simulate a noisy environment or we could simulate a distant access point which can tell us not just how fast and reliable connection can be or what bands the device supports but even how battery life might be affected by having to crank the transmit power due to crummy reception now you might be thinking whoa slow down there turbo how are you going to test 5G in an impenetrable box well with my own cell phone network of course if I had one thanks to the crtc and similar regulatory bodies you have to get permission to use the parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that are reserved for cell phone service and that permission is expensive Canadian Telco spent a collective 3.5 billion for licenses to the 600 megahertz band that's just one bed I can't do that so instead we're going to be purchasing a fire cell lab kit we're going to go into way more detail in a future video but here's the quick and dirty version if you're a big company big like apple or BMW you would likely get corporate and Regulatory approval to run your tests using an actual cell like the antenna on a cell tower these are very expensive though full of corporate secrets and frankly overkill for our purposes anyway the fire cell on the other hand is one of if not the only off-the-shelf testing units and it allows us to test 4G 5G and after an incoming update even millimeter wave and because the government can't detect our Network as long as it stays in this box I am very unlikely to get arrested for broadcasting on reserved frequencies in fact no one can even hear you scream watch this I couldn't help noticing the fire cell stuff is not here that's right so it's arriving on June 6th uh it's you know early birthday present for my wife and dog house no it arrives on June 6th okay uh we're going to have it positioned here on a desk we're actually gonna have to get some floor cutouts done so we can spread some of the weight we don't want the table punching through the the styrofoam here right right because these foam things you didn't see these in the construction video These are the negative of the carbon impregnated foam here and it allows us to just walk on it I guess they have no function RF wise uh very very minimal reflection got it and they can hold enough weight kalinam was in here with me no problem wow you're gonna call them I don't like that he called himself out first his nickname is Nick he gave it to himself yeah yeah okay but you'll have to explain to me what's the usefulness of testing a 4G network from like four meters away that's not realistic well effectively what we can do is we can control the power levels that we're broadcasting at to simulate different distances the way that these Chambers work and with the frequency bands we're testing we need to be able to have the broadcast equipment a certain distance to the wall and a certain distance from the device under test that's why I've got this kind of C shape here so we can get over here this is where the broadcast equipment will be and then over there we're gonna have a pedestal with the device under test how do we simulate things like obstructions because those exist in the real world one of the cool things with that is we actually have a fair bit of leftover foam including some of the flat lossy absorber so we can position that in between the device that's broadcasting and the device under test we can also bring in other larger pieces wood framing walls a sheet of drywall if we wanted to to see how that actually impacts things and I can tell you on millimeter wave if you have even a pane of glass in between you in the broadcast antenna you'll lose connection we go into a lot more depth about the actual construction of the chamber in another video we're going to have that Linked In the description and if you want to hear even more about it Jake Danes from the lab recorded a deeper dive that's going to be coming soon at floatplane.com LTT coming back to the outside world as outside as we get these days let's take a look at our benchmarking situation it's never been a problem to script performance testing for games that include canned benchmarks and some of you helpfully pointed that out when I talked about how cool mark bench was going to be because we could automate all this stuff but what's not that easy is running pre-done repeatable benchmarks for games that don't include Ken benchmarks well guess what we can do that now and I would love to interview the team that has been working on it but Nick's on vacation Jesse's shy and these two are on probation so Tim will be helping us behind us we've got three separate benches running through our Graphics testing Suite right now but the key night among you will have noticed that there's a fourth monitor that's doing something called OCR or optical character recognition why do we need that when we could just run an auto hotkey script yeah yeah totally Auto hotkey strips are dumb and we don't want to use those because if they run into problems they have no way to solve them and so the way that we're moving forward with developing the harnesses for the games that we want to test is making sure that they're flexible they're reliable and if a new screen pops up because of a new season update or something that we haven't yet caught is is just kind of buggy we want to be able to click on those things reliably and repeatably got it so okay that just changed why are we looking at that monster yeah what you can see is there are some green boxes around various pieces of text that it sees every screen that it shows there is a failure to find what it's looking for it's looking for a specific set of characters or a specific word to click on it next action and each screen that we're looking at is it not finding it yet pretty cool theoretically it's scalable too we're running three right now but we can connect a whole bunch more and Adam said that we weren't going to talk about this but I decided it's really cool we are going to talk about it what Jesse's been working on mostly is taking this entire dump of recorded footage and chopping out all the crap we don't need so we don't see any menus or any junk like that it's just all Benchmark runs which is going to be super cool when we're editing them down for you guys to see side-by-side gameplay yeah that's the bulk of our work when we're trying to trying to get through an embargo or a review of something and we're trying to make sure that that doesn't need to be done anymore sick I noticed something else that's really cool this keyboard says recording on it right now and my understanding is that it's red for a reason yeah so we are working in RGB but we've got R right now um the reason that we have R is because we actually found that alt tabbing in some games was causing performance issues we were not getting repeatable results by switching to mark bench starting recording switching back to the game and we needed a way to know is that recording running rather than having it on the screen which was also a performance impact so once RGB is working you said we're going to have a progress indicator meaning that these keyboards are basically acting as glorified LED strips and recording lamps thanks steel series ah a wild time it appears we have completed our first test print on our metal 3D printer and naturally we chose oh a scale replica of the LTT screwdriver handle now we can't show you guys the inside of the oven NDA and all of that noise but we can talk a little bit about our experience with the rapidia metal 3D printer I see you did an end cap as well I see it in a completely different finish what are we even looking at right now I printed both of these and did vastly different post processes on these after it came out of our furnace rapidia generally suggests sanding it before it even goes in because sanding steel is a lot harder than sanding essentially clay wait that's what it starts with yeah so shut up that is so cool okay just a second here so so this is what you put in and this came out yeah it's so much bigger there's about a 16 shrink rate for the parts after they come out 16 1 6. you mean 60 that looks so much bigger that's a 16 difference yep interesting when it's in three dimensions it looks a lot bigger than it is so wait what so this is just a support thing then oh my God look it's totally 3D printed supports and the steel is just embedded in the clay yeah so it's it's part of it and I use the term clay it's not really clay it's steel and a binding material but it just it's a very similar texture to like a clay pot before it's fired at this wow so for a bit of reference this is a support piece that I printed for something else uh-huh break that easy pretty much like it's nothing okay now where's a metal printed support piece okay now you want me to break this you can try don't do that I noticed that you haven't actually assembled this into a screwdriver I assume because it's difficult to press fit a shaft into did you think of that before you started yes and since we're not actually making a metal screwdriver at least to my knowledge um what is the point of this project doing this project is building knowledge within the team of how to use this equipment so when we need to use it for either a video or for prototyping merch merch items we have the expertise and don't need to rush to try to build the expertise when we want to shoot a video in a week got it now tell me something is there a structural disadvantage to this like can I just like is it just a hunk of stainless steel or is it like other 3D printed plastic objects where the structural Integrity of it is inferior to a cast piece it is a little bit inferior in terms of like overall mechanical properties but for anything we're gonna do yeah it's essentially solid steel not a scratch can we even show like oh we can show this yeah we can show this oh cool okay you're printing keycaps because of course you are yeah I have one they're there so this is what it actually comes off the printer as we have two nozzles one that does the metal paste and one that does a support So for all of these pieces the actual part you want is separated from the base by an aluminum material which is essentially a ceramic otherwise it's going to bond together and you are not getting it apart right to get this thing off of its support and it had proper separation I still had to whack it with a hammer a whole bunch of times sick are we doing a middle screwdriver maybe oh yeah and then all the excitement I almost forgot to update you guys we've officially moved in I've got procurement over here on my right I've got Logistics over here on my left they're very proud of their new cable ties that are color coded for different cable lengths no I it's a good thing someone is that a bell is that a bell what that's the doorbell that is an awful doorbell also it is getting awfully hot in here we actually booked air conditioning for this Warehouse a year ago and we are still waiting for air conditioning units so it's going to get a little stuffy over the next little bit here RAM storage now that's a creative use of server rack shelves ah my intention was to introduce you guys to our community manager and talk to the social team here but I guess they're all on lunch so cool I'm sure glad we delayed this shoot from after hours yesterday to today so that everyone would be here anyway the point is they only just moved in why because of this the server room that is next door to them it was so freaking loud in that room that we had to add Sound Treatment to all of the walls and ceiling of this room just to make sure that it would be quiet enough so you could hear yourself think over there unfortunately even after we added our three layer solution of sonopan Rockwall and duveteen it was still loud and it turned out there was some annoying buzz from one of the Transformers that's directly above them I bet Jake that we would actually have to replace that Transformer he bet that we could just use some isolation pads under it and long story short I owe Jake two lunches it's pretty good in there Old Trafford here this is where you'll find the MAC address folks and Jake bellavonts is usually here our short circuit Channel lead so this is what I'm talking about we're trying to show a building full of people we moved in with and the no no you're good you're good Sam go go lunch lunch The Writer's area is fully moved into Jake and James haven't taken over that office that I'm sure inevitably they will take over at some point Emily's desk Tanner Jordan what are you working on what the hell is this not this that what is that that's not working right now what the heck Adam and Pluto you know yeah I I know where my office is it's still very not set up um as it turns out I have more important things to do than arrange things in my office let's go figure look I mean yeah I have an assistant but it turns out he has more important things to do than arrange things in my office where the hell is everybody well Brandon Dickerson's space is here he's set up this like neutral gray over everything so that he can do display testing I was told that these two Scopes cost the same as like a decent car um they're for color I'm sure Brandon's gonna have a big update for you guys once he's got his proper space set up out in the warehouse but at least this is getting us some data in the meantime and he can work on his testing methodology what is this secret for you is this Poe powered I think it's security cameras security camera what no I think it's going to be security cameras it's LTT store okay what is this thing what is the point of it ubiquity makes a display now um it's like a Poe power touchscreen oh okay for what I don't know you can show the cameras but you can upload any Android app I was thinking for LTX this would be like a really dope way for people to be able to just like pre-brow stuff oh yeah oh I know for some of you that must feel like not enough progress like what's going on this is taking forever to get Labs going but the reality is we're taking the time that we need to do it right I mean think about it app slash roaming data wasn't built in a day that's some computer humor for you and I'm gonna follow it up with this segue to our sponsor vesi looking for a new pair of kicks to wear during the summer pick up a pair of
