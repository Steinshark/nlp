there's still this desire to get answers to the why question that if if we're if the world is a simulation if we're living in a simulation that there's a programmer like creature that we can ask questions okay so let's put let's pursue the idea that we're living in a city simulation which is not not totally ridiculous by the way there we go then you still need to explain the programmer the programmer had to come into existence by some the even if we're in this in a simulation the the programmer must have evolved or if if he's in a sort of more she's or she she she's in a meta simulation then the the meta meta programmer must have evolved by a gradual process you can't escape that fundamentally you've got to come back to a gradual incremental process of explanation to start with there's no shortcuts in this world but maybe to linger on that point about the simulation do you think it's an interesting I basically talked to boarded the heck out of everybody asking this question but whether you live in a simulation do you think first do you think we live in a simulation second do you think it's an interesting thought experiment it's certainly an interesting thought experiment I first met it in a science fiction novel by Daniel gal I called counterfeit world in which it's all about I mean I our heroes are running a gigantic computer which which simulates the world and and something goes wrong and so one of them has to go down into the simulated world in order to fix it and then the the the Dynamo of the thing the climate so novel is that they discover themselves in another simulation at a high level so I was intrigued by this and I love others of Daniel gallows science fiction novels then it was revived seriously by Nick Bostrom boss from talking to him in an hour okay and he goes further not just treated as a science fiction speculation he actually thinks it's positively likely yeah I mean it's very likely actually well he's he makes like a probabilistic argument which you can use to come up with very interesting conclusions about the nature of this universe I mean he think he thinks that that that we are in a simulation done by so to speak are descendants of a future that the products but it's still a product of evolution it's still ultimately going to be a product of evolution even though the super intelligent people of the future have created our world and you and I are just a simulation in this table is a simulation and so on I don't actually in my heart of hearts believe it but that I like his argument well so the interesting thing is that I agree with you but the interesting thing to me if I would say if we're living in the simulation that in that simulation to make it work you still have to do everything gradually just like you said that even though it's program I don't think there could be miracles otherwise we'll note I mean the the programmer the higher up the upper ones have to have evolved gradually however the simulation they create could be instantaneous I mean it could be switched on and we come into the world with fabricated memories true but what I'm what I'm trying to convey so you're saying the the broader statement but I'm saying from an engineering perspective both the programmer has to be slowly evolved and the simulation because it's like yeah I'm an engineering perspective yeah it takes a long time to write a program no like just I don't think you can create the universe in a snap I think you have to grow it okay well that's not that's a good point that's an arguable point by the way um I I have thought about using the Nick Bostrom eye idea to solve the riddle of how we were talking we were talking earlier about why the human brain can achieve so much I thought of this when my then hundred year old mother was marveling at what I could do with it with a smartphone and I could you know coral look up anything in the encyclopedia I could play her music that she liked and so Jane please it's all in that in that tiny little phone no it's it's out there it's in it's in the cloud it's and maybe what most of what we do is in a cloud so maybe if if we're if we are a simulation yeah then all the power that we think is in our skull it actually may be like the power that we think is in the iPhone but is that actually out there it's an interface to something else yeah I mean that's what beautifully including roger penrose with pen psychism that consciousness is somehow a fundamental part of physics that it doesn't have to actually all reside inside a network but Roger thinks it does reside in the skull whereas I'm suggesting that it doesn't that it's that there's a cloud that'd be a fascinating fascinating notion and a small tangent are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman I guess maybe nothing is named correctly but just forget the name the idea that there's a difference between reality and perception so like we biological organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to be able to survive and so on but that doesn't mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamental reality the physical reality or in youth well I do think that although it reflects the fundamental reality I do believe there is a fundamental reality I do think that what the perception is constructive in the sense that we construct in our minds a model of what we're seeing and so this is really the view of people who work on visual illusions like Richard Gregory who point out the things like an echo cube which flipped from a two-dimensional picture of a cube on on on a sheet of paper but we see it as a three-dimensional cube and it flips from one orientation to another at regular intervals what's going on is that the brain is is constructing a cube but the sense-data are compatible with two alternative cubes and so rather than stick with one of them it alternates between them I think that's just a a model for what we do all the time when we see a table when we see a person when we see her let me see anything we're using the sense data to construct or or make use of a preps previously constructed model I noticed this when when I meet somebody who actually is say a friend of mine but I until I kind of realized that that is him he looks different and then when I finally clock that it's him his features switch like an echo cube it's just into the familiar form is it as it were I've taken his face out of the filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto or used use the sense data to to to you to in to invoke it yeah we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter out most of the sun's data it makes it make sense of it that's just a magical thing that we do you
