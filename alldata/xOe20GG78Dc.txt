[Music] thank you hey everyone welcome back to part two of this series where I'm taking you on location throughout the whole process of making an independent documentary in the last video we went into all the steps that go into pre-production and planning a shoot and today I'm super excited to get into the fun stuff by which I mean the shoot itself because as important as pre-production is the shooting is what it's really all about for me we're going to be in San Diego California shooting a really powerful story about Jose who is a former Soldier and triple amputee who found healing through surfing originally we were planning on covering all the production in one video but once we wrapped and I looked through the footage I realized there was just way too much good stuff in here so we decided to split into two videos so we don't have to cut out as much I'm going to show you everything I'm doing as I'm doing it and give you some insights into some of the techniques and setups I use for shooting high quality docks with a small team if you missed the first video on pre-production you might want to check that out first but just to go over some of the ground rules of this whole project this film was funded by the art of documentary last year I said I thought aod was the best online film school out there for documentary filmmakers and then a couple of months ago I met Mark and Michael who run the course and they challenged me to put their methods to the test during a real world shoot to see if I still think it's the best option out there and that's exactly what I'm going to do in this series this isn't about selling the course to you because I'm not getting paid for this in fact I'll probably lose money in the end and when I took the course I signed up with my own cash there is a link in the description if you want to sign up for the next cohort launching March 13th and save a bit of money but I'm under no obligation to say anything and my opinions are 100 my own this is a real documentary shoot with an amazing character and story and all I'm going to do is compare my own style with what aod teaches and see if I still think it's the best choice out there in 2023 we also brought along Richard to shoot dedicated BTS on this one actually he's a member of the aod community so there's one real world example of how the course can connect filmmakers before we even get started and Rich shot a ton of great stuff on this one so I hope you enjoy this series as much as we enjoyed making it [Music] thank you thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so we just got here to Victorville California it's been a super long day it's been a great drive it's great to see Eros but we have a lot still to do we've got to build the camera rig we've got to test out the gear make sure everything's working we have to go over the surf reports go over the schedule and the interview questions so we're just going to get into it because I need to go to sleep all right so we are here in this beautiful hotel room um before we get into some of the pre-planning this is Eros hogland the co-director of this film Eros and I met through mutual friends Eris is like a big time photojournalist if you've ever seen the Michael Mann documentary witness Eros was in two of the episodes and he did The Stills for the battle scene and the Revenant he's just like an amazing photographer and he was the one who actually suggested this story so I pretty much owe the whole thing to arrows so how did you find this story well I met Jose about five or six years ago I was a volunteer surf instructor at a surf Clinic meant for veterans dealing with emotional and physical traumas and Jose was one of the graduates and I saw this guy surfing he's got basically one arm you know he's triple amputee and I saw this guy surfing and I'll be being pushed into ways I was just this amazing character and we became friends and started talking about a still photo documentary project that I wanted to do with him and I began it and this was just before a pandemic hit and then that happened so everything got stuck on a stuck on a long dark shelf and then we rehashed this idea sitting in Baja California in Mexico you suggested it and I thought this is an amazing documentary story and I mentioned it to Mark and Michael at aod and they put up the funding for the hard cause of travel and now here we are so tomorrow we're gonna go meet Jose but this is a surfing documentary so we need to just get on to the surf report and see if there's any chance of getting actual surfing so I don't have high hopes yeah I feel like this is one of these things that we were locked in by days and it's one of the limitations of doing things super Indie if you've got a ton of time and money or if you do local things this is why I'm always talking about trying to do projects that are local to you so you don't have to get on a plane if there's no surf then we're going to have to shift to option b it doesn't look good it doesn't no our window does not look good it's it's saying it's projecting one to two foot on Thursday two to three feet on Friday that's all right I mean you never know the surf report but at the very least I have a feeling we're going to get in the water no matter what sometimes you just have to go to see what the ocean gives you the sage advice for maybe what we're doing as well it's really probably mirrors the sentiment of the documentary shooting being totally honest this is not the ideal surf report for a documentary about surfing but we're here we're doing it and we're going to see what the ocean provides tomorrow right that's right well tomorrow morning we are going to have breakfast with Jose we're going to get up really early and we're going to shoot b-roll the town but we don't want to just like crash through Jose's front door with cameras blazing so we're going to give them a bit of a chill morning we're going to do our thing shooting b-roll around the area and then we're going to go have a nice breakfast still no filming we're just going to introduce ourselves and talk so probably over breakfast we can sort of pick his brain on whether or not it's worth shifting it a day or we're just gonna have to wait and see right we're gonna have to wait and see if any really strong surfing to be done to be filmed so that looks good for Thursday so Thursday would be better for a cleaner stuff for the reflective well it's all on you so or else is going to be doing the uh all the all the water stuff I'm gonna get some mood images out of the water our Moody ocean stuff all right so we've got our plan set for tomorrow and even if it's not exactly what we wanted to hear uh we're just gonna go with it next we need to set up all the cameras and test all the gear and then try and get a good night's sleep because it's going to be an early start tomorrow [Music] foreign [Music] thank you okay so that's the camera pretty much built I do pretty minimal rigging mostly because I want the camera to be as light as humanly possible so the only thing I put on it that you might not have seen are one of these shape arms I think there's lots of companies who make support arms but the one button way that these things work from what I've seen they're the fastest and simplest way to adjust These Arms a lot of people ask me about this monitor arm for some reason I get this in the comments all the time this is a wooden camera Universal monitor arm it's just a 15 mil rail that goes through the handle and extends a NATO rail out this way then I stick the monitor on the side so that's what that is you can stop asking me and then the last thing is a Time code box this is a technical sync E and I've talked about time code basically this means that every camera that we run is going to be synced with our audio all of them on the same internal clocks other than that I don't use anything fancy on this rig I don't put a shoulder plate I just put the tripod base plate on the bottom and then straight onto my shoulder people often also ask me is it uncomfortable and like yeah kinda but it saves three or four pounds on all of the big pieces of metal and for me that's totally worth it and this whole thing you know it's a pretty big cinema camera but it's really not that heavy so for me this works in terms of creative decisions that we're making on this we are gonna try and shoot as much as possible on primes I'm going to use just these simple Sigma art primes I have the Fuji Cinema zooms as well but because we have a lot of time there's no pressure there's no like crazy events that I'm gonna miss it's a little more creatively challenging and I think the final look is a bit more organic sometimes when you're being paid you don't have the luxury because if you miss a moment your someone's really mad at you so for paid jobs I use a lot of zooms and the other thing we're doing a little differently creatively on this is we're shooting at a 235 cinematic aspect ratio we're doing it for a very conscious reason which is that Jose our main character doesn't have any legs so his world is on a different vertical level than most people as a visual representation of what it's like to be him I I think it I think it works well for his world okay so that's it for building the rig we're almost there so I'm going to finish up a few final things and then go to bed and get started early tomorrow well let's see how he feels about that because I think that whole process of putting on those Prosthetics like to show what a process it is just to do simple things would be yeah we'll see we'll still tell them what we want to do and be like hey what do you guys say why don't we meet here at 6 30 load up and go okay yeah yeah cool it's late it takes a while to think about things that's just how it goes good night everybody oh YouTube hello how nice of you to join me at the Best Western in Victorville California it is around 6 a.m maybe just before and we want to take advantage of the nice light this morning but we also want to give Jose the morning off so that we don't just jump into his house on day one really early in the morning guns blazing so we just got to load all this stuff up into the car get some coffee and then we're off to shoot b-roll oh all right oh boy oh no [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] underneath yeah we can get right onto the ground nice that's awesome I know I said last night that we're gonna shoot this whole thing on primes and we are for all of the the actual action moments but sometimes with b-roll especially in Landscapes I personally like that compression look that you can only get with zoom lenses so 24 mil on everything is kind of limiting okay so we just finished our b-roll for the morning and Jose messaged us to say he was good to go so we're driving over to his place now we're gonna take it slow and just sit down and have a conversation with him one of the things I think they stress really well in aod I believe it's module two is that the people you're making documentaries about become collaborators so Jose is not some object but we're just gonna knock on his front door with the camera in his face like I don't know an episode of cops or something I'm gonna go in there have a conversation with him and you know get to know everybody before we start filming so on our way now and uh about to start the shoot properly [Music] oh I would love to see you guys just go do something in town it can be like the most mundane thing ever the plan anniversary we love love love to the planet like we're trying to make this grow what do you like I gotta put my legs on for that so you guys can get a glimpse of that yeah if you yeah I think that's kind of a cool process to see as well I was like you better not say good groceries was like fear and then like a nursery and then you lit up you're like I know what it is we're going to get ice cream yeah so I told them we're going to be there Friday Saturday at the gym yeah okay because I had to let them know that they're like we just want to make sure that you're good that's fine so if that's okay with you guys that's the one thing that we need to kind of establish in this is what are your like you've got the goal of inspiring people but also what are your you know concrete like surfing goals you want to that's a great one like you want to ride a barrel the reason why I ride the way I ride like I have this uh switch foot that everybody goes dude you do like a check turn that everybody thinks you're gonna go one way and then you swing your board I love John John Florence he serves at pipeline all the time like I've watched him do errors all kinds of stuff hopefully one day I can do an Eric show off that it's possible no matter what yeah yeah but that's that's really the reason why is because I've watched Jamie O'Brien and John John Florence Jamie O'Brien doesn't compete only on Pipeline but he does a lot of videos showing how to get barrels and stuff like that and I've dude like I've started putting my nub in it so I can slow down like I'm figuring I'm trying to figure it out because one day I want to go out there and I want to be able to start paddling for the way and everybody say don't go Jose's going yeah right I just want to have that kind of I have respect for the ocean and respect for everybody and I don't want to think that I can just go out there and do it so is that it in a sentence is like to ride a barrel on your own in Hawaii right that's like that's awesome I love that that's that's that would be interested pipeline yeah I'll write that down [Music] so we had a really great conversation with Jose and his wife and we talked about the schedule we made a plan now we're actually ready to start filming the very first thing we have to do is deal with audio because we're always talking about how audio is the backbone of the whole story if you have bad audio it's not going to work we're using external recording lav mics we're not using Wireless Labs because we have a technical issue and because we're using two cameras we also need to make sure they're on the same time code so we're going to sync all of our audio and cameras together using time code right now these things are Master clocks and then we're going to sync all of our mics individually to this and then put a second one of these on the B cam as well so that everything is operating on the same exact time so that when we go to edit everything together in post it's going to be a lot easier than trying to manually match everything by waveforms it's just going to all sync together automatically yeah and then both those lights start blinking at the same time we put this one on the B Cam and then the final step is to take one of the mics so instead of a lav mic these mics have an internal SD card and it's going to record everything internally whether we're speeding on the camera or not and that can be super helpful for a bunch of reasons like you don't have to be recording on the camera so if you start you know someone starts saying something interesting and then you start rolling on the camera with a normal Wireless lab you're going to miss that because you weren't recording but with these you have the audio so then you sync this to this [Music] so for a moment like this this is really cool we just want to show a little bit of Jose and Lisa's personal life and you know we just asked them where they wanted to go and they wanted to come to a nursery to go shopping for treats and along the way Jose told us this like amazing story about how he started gardening because after he got hurt he wanted to also care and help other things grow and recover and it's just an amazing metaphor for his whole life experience and the person that he's become so I guess it's just you never know what's going to happen like when someone suggests let's go film in a tree nursery you don't expect any dramatic scenes to happen but if you just let Life play out it's pretty amazing sometimes what can come one thing I will say about these Anton Bauer batteries is that they actually have the exact number of minutes left in the charge in a display in the side which is a first for me in batteries that I've owned which is like not something I ever thought I needed to know but pretty great [Music] yeah so he the archery gives him Focus it's a new it's a new activity I mean it's physically impressive so that we're definitely gonna shoot it do we need to shoot it in a way that motivates is it just to show how he refuses to not do things that he's not supposed to be able to do or is it because of the meditative aspects what do we need to draw out of this you think we should do should we ask some questions while he's doing it or should we pull all of this stuff out later in the master interview I think it would be cool to get a static shot like super wide you see the Bales and then he comes in I think this is the better background if we shoot it here it'll be a mess we can't shoot we just can't shoot it here because of the Shadow he'll be in Shadow but the whole background will be blown out so I think like I think we need him to be in the sun hi dog hello hello all right so it's been a fairly long day with Jose already we have one more Scene to shoot which is him doing archery he's a bow hunter it just seems it's mind-boggling that someone can still shoot a bow at a high level uh when they only have one arm but he's doing it so it's an incredible scene problem is we're losing light and the areas where we're trying to shoot are in summer and Shadow and summer and bright lights we're trying to figure out how to get that all together and we also need to do it really quickly because the sun's about to go down and then we're done so uh really early morning tomorrow this is the last scene of the day so let's just try and get it finished and then get out of here thank you that's 16 back it up until the [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] okay so that was a great first day with Jose lovely guy I have just gotten to nellum so I'm only scratching the surface here but he's just really inspiring to be around all day I I really liked him uh you might also notice that my desk is not super clean we're gonna clean it up before uh everyone told me to clean it up but uh I feel like on YouTube a lot of the time we have these nice including me have these really nice clean desk setups which is not at all reflective of How I Live when I'm on the road actually making stuff so I thought I'd just leave all this garbage here and you can see what a dirty animal I actually am so that when you're watching the nice desk videos you appreciate the effort I go to even more anyways we're going to try and get through the backup workflow really quickly because we're only going to be able to sleep for about four or five hours tonight we gotta be up at 2 45 tomorrow to uh go surfing with Jose the short version is I've made videos about this stuff before and if you want more detailed breakdowns of this let me know in the comments and I can definitely do that later not tonight I'm sorry the short version is you take all the media you take an area and you Market cards to go in you make another very clearly defined area cards to go out it could be like a tupperware container or a square of tape just an area where the end goes and the out goes everything you shot from all sources goes into the end you make a consistent file structure separate the files by date camera and card and then go one by one everything across until you're done then back it up twice and that's it that's the end of the day and that's not you know optional so if you're out actually shooting stuff you have to do it every night like a discipline you uh it's not something you can leave till the morning so even though we're only gonna be able to sleep for a couple of hours tonight this is not something that we'll put off and do later this gets done tonight and then double backed up because if you only have one you essentially have no backups so great first day really excited for tomorrow and uh yeah good night okay thank you my thinking face yeah yeah keep that that's that's that's the joke yeah yeah shoot the cutaways of the nasty garbage yeah yeah no joke focus on that accentuated [Music] oh I'm so tired [Music] hope you like that one because I personally think Richard did a great job on that BTS he shot so much good stuff that like I said we're stretching this video into two parts so that we don't have to cut out as much so stay tuned for that one next week where I'm also going to give some of my final thoughts on whether or not I think aod is still the best online option out there thanks for joining and I'll see you all soon see ya [Music]
