hey everyone this is kind of a follow-up from the video i made a few weeks ago about using aces for visual effects so let's get straight to the point i'm going to transition to this view and you can see my screen basically anyone that's set up aces in blender so far or has seen people using it in videos will know that the color spaces list is gigantic that's not even the full list you can see it goes off to the side here i actually have to zoom out further to be able to see the entire list of color spaces so how many have we got here one two three four five six seven twenty two twenty three twenty four by one two three four seven eight nine number 13 hey google what's 15 times 24 15 by 24 is 360. so give or take a few that's 360 color spaces which is obviously quite a lot out of this whole list lots of them are duplicates so there's more than one of each color space and they just have multiple names prime example of this over here we have all of the aces color spaces with capital letters and then down here we have the same ones with smaller letters here very similar thing you can literally see them next to each other outrex 709 output rec 709 out srgb output srgb all the roles were capital letters or the roles of lowercase letters so after using aces for about a year and being very sick of this system i took it upon myself to rectify it and so what i've done is abbreviate the list to just the ones that you actually need as you can see this is my custom list of aces color spaces the only ones i really use are roll data and roll matte paint these are the equivalent of srgb and non-color data in the normal versions of blender and then utility linear srgb is what you use for hdris because they're linear exrs the other ones i don't actually use but when i got rid of them it broke everything so you have to leave these in but after a lot of experimenting for about a day i believe that this is the absolute minimum list of color spaces that you can have using aces in blender so the way i did this is i took the aces config file which looks something like this and it has a list of all the color spaces here this is the one that i've slimmed down if i scroll down a bit each of the color spaces has its own small chunk of text and this is what basically tells blender what the names of them are and everything now if i open the original aces config file you can see this list is absolutely enormous keep scrolling keep scrolling keep scrolling keep scrolling keep scrolling so this is all 360 give or take of the ones i counted earlier and basically what i did to get the shorter list is just go through and delete all of the irrelevant ones here at first i thought it was simple i just deleted all the ones except for the three main ones that i use but then like i said i found that it broke it so in the end what i did is go through and delete a few at a time and then do a test render to make sure the colors weren't still broken so if you'd like to get your hands on the customized version of this config file there is a link below and it will take you to a public page on my patreon you don't have to subscribe to my patreon or anything to get it it's going to be free i'm just hosting it on there and from there you can download it and all you have to do once you've downloaded it is go to your windows hard drive go to program files blender foundation the version of blender you're using the version number folder data files color management and then you drop it in here i made a duplicate of the one with all of the aces color spaces and just renamed it to something other than config.ocio so this is the full aces version just in case i have a backup of it and this is the config.ocio that you download from the patreon so that's my gift to the community hopefully it will make it a bit easier to use aces and blender going forward if you found this video useful feel free to like and subscribe to thank me for the day i spent digging around in that stupid config file thanks for watching see you next time [Music] you
