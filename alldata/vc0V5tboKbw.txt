lot of competitive stuff a lot of fun stuff a lot of other activities that you know aren't chess uh so yeah link is in the description and that's all I have to tell you it's quite far away I know but uh so so are the candidates and here you are watching these games Hikaru Nakamura versus Ivan chaparo now fun fact about Ivan chapar which you can look at after this recap there's a video of him uh playing Nigel short there's a clip on YouTube and he was involved in like a he he didn't want to shake hands with his opponent they had a beef and he was like forfeited for not shaking hands I don't know if that's a thing in any any other sport but like imagine a football match you end and like you don't shake hands do you get like fined that's CRA anyway so I've known about chipino for many years very good player and in this game hikaro played e45 Knight F3 and chipino played a Petro defense Hikaru took an E5 went back and then already here played a very big surprise for me uh and I I really love this he car has been playing a lot of interesting openings in this tournament he didn't play D4 which is the main line he didn't play Knight C3 which is the other main line he played C4 which I I have played myself uh but uh but not at you know the grand Swiss playing for the candidates his opponent develops his bishop and now Karo plays D4 and that's interesting because you know I generally thought that after Bishop E7 white kicks out the knight uh now you can play D4 and you've kind of stopped black from playing D5 and sort of the setup is designed to you know if black castles Bishop D3 and then black might play Knight back but instead he just plays D5 anyway completely unafraid now the interesting thing if you look at the time spend um he car have spent three minutes on the third move and that's interesting cuz I suppose he uh he might have been surprised by something or he was playing poker you know like maybe he was just pretending to be surprised right Bluff that he has uh he has some sort of whole cards right cuz look at chiarina he hasn't spent any time and I mean Hikaru just blitzing and now uh an interesting fact about this position as hikaro brought his Knight out and the pawn structure got clarified hikaro has an iqp isolated Queen Pawn no C no E Pawn uh he wants to advance that pawn forward he wants to use the squares around the pawn to try to put pressure on his opponent his opponent wants to block that pawn and then make it immobile trade a bunch of pieces now apparently this position was reached in um a game Carana giri from 12 years ago in 2011 if I'm not mistaken uh that was one of Anish gir's uh best tournaments if I if if if what I read was correct and I am not uh misremembering anyway remember black is going to try to retreat trade some pieces block hikaro from playing D5 hikaro goes here plays Rook e one we trade Bishops and then he plays Knight to A5 putting some pressure on that pawn hoping for B6 which is not going to happen uh but Knight B6 and he develops and now chiarino sacrifices the B7 Pawn so basically Ivon says all right man look you can take on B7 cuz I don't really want to defend it passively so you do I centralize my queen you now have to come back and then I kick out your your your knight so chiparo says you know what I'm fine being a pawn down that's it I'm fine being a PA down and um I'm just going to put pressure on your position Rook E8 now did he have to do that did he have to sacrifice the pawn uh no uh he probably could have played Rook B8 I think he just really didn't want to I mean I just think he thought he was going to be very passive and not massive and this way he's not passive and he's definitely massive so uh Queen D3 and I mean now now it's basically like look like Knight C5 interesting tactics here Knight takes Pawn takes and uh there's this very big moment here of tension and now it's all gone right Hikaru just trades Knights trades Rooks and has to now win this endgame somewhere Magnus is sitting there watching going I wonder if Hikaru can do this I can't do a Norwegian accent so I don't actually know how Magnus thinks but I do know that they don't actually call him Magnus in Norwegian did you know that they actually call him mnus which is like it's like Mangus like Angus but Angus mangnus so I could be nor I mean I listen I fit the part you just got to change my name to Freud like and then put a sen at the end of it you know uh computers and I'll be Fjord computers and there you go now I'm Norwegian mnos mnus Carlson Rook D1 anyway that was a little weird Norwegian interlude and now Karu just has to win this endgame Rook knight5 versus rook knight4 and let me tell you something Ivan chipino was not in the business of throwing this endgame my man defended it absolutely bre in a breathtaking way he pushed hearo backwards Knight C1 Rook went there and they danced around a little bit now an interesting fact uh arose a little bit later actually excuse me a little bit earlier uh there was a moment here in the the this there was a moment it happens a little while later nope I'm missing the moment Karo could have played Rook to D5 instead of uh something that he did instead um going to find that move for you might have been no it was not here I can't remember where it was it was uh here here right here yes there was a moment that hikaro was winning this is the only move considered in the entire game where hikaro made any sort of inaccuracy and it's because he had to find Rook D5 which walks into a fork but then keeps an eye on The Rook so you can't actually take it and then if something like Rook to A2 is played you can actually play Rook takes A5 and uh if black plays something like Knight to D3 threatening Rook to F2 uh White can basically like give a check and escape and then try to advance with these two pawns uh but there's a very long sequence of moves there uh which which will result in you probably losing this Pawn but advancing these so it's not very easy to do that uh and instead of playing Rook to D5 uh because there was some sequence there where black could have probably defended a little bit more uh precisely Karu just went for this end game where he's threatening a Checkmate and then he wins the A5 pawn and stockfish can defend this endgame for a very long time as black but chiarina of rushes and he should not have traded into a rook end game let that serve as a lesson to you you have got to be 100% certain that trading into a rook end game is going to be a draw chipev did not have a huge amount of time on the clock I I think uh and what he should have done is he should have just kept the Knight on the board but I think he just basically thought he was going to lose no matter what he just thought this Pawn was going to come up no matter what and he goes into a rook end game and this is just losing this is losing because white advances his King white trades these pawns and white is basically just going to win that pawn while not losing the a pawn Rook D6 A6 and King D4 and in this position chip but didn't have resigned because Rook A4 check King C5 Rook takes A7 and something like King B6 and the game is over if this King B7 G3 Rook D3 A8 Queen there's nothing you can do AAR Nakamura is now tied for first at the Grand Swiss with two rounds to go and he won this game in nearly perfect style I mean there was one moment in that game that the engine was like well actually Hikaru you should have played the move Rook to D5 you see I thought Rook B7 was not the best move for all intents and purposes hikaro played a great game and somewhere the endgame God that is Magnus Carlson gave a thumbs up so a really nice game from Hikaru now there was battles all over the place this is a game for first place and this one did not go how you would expect it to go Fabiano Carana Budan Daniel deak just got into a tie for first place and Fabiano plays a pretty big sideline of the Italian which is this very early and aggressive Bishop H G5 and H4 and the idea is to provoke black into doing this the idea is to wave a red flag in front of a bull so guess what that is exactly what happens Fabiano invites a fist fight and a fist fight is what he's got and here comes Knight H7 ready for H5 and G4 black just says all right I mean I'm going to support my pawns and I'm going to push them Fabi now has to act quickly so he puts pressure on the Knight and then plays this look at deak by the way deak is not even thinking he hasn't spent any time this is the first time he thought and I think he was debating between Knight here and H5 and H5 is a move and then there's a line here which goes H4 G4 you can't go here because you'll get your knight trapped in many lines so you have to come here but Dak plays Knight G6 straight away and now Fabby plays Knight to E3 so we have a very tense position because it's basically like look is deak going to advance these pawns and Checkmate Fabby or is Fabby going to make deak look silly right so if black plays H5 here white gets the Knight to F5 then black can play Queen F6 and then white will play something like H4 and then if you play too slowly I plug these these Knights and then you know takes takes takes I have Bishop F7 and white is winning so Queen d8 he goes here H3 now H5 and fabbi decides that deok has no idea how to play chess and he just plays on the total opposite side of the board like this is some of the most disrespectful chess I've ever seen dude is literally telling you I am going like come out of the house with your hands up Fabby and Fab's like yoink and boink playing on literally the complete opposite side of the board while this dude is standing over here like I'm GNA beat you up you bozo if you don't and and and and here comes G4 Here Comes G4 take take Fabby slides back to H2 and I got to tell you this looks really nice look at Bugan and suddenly things are looking very dire for Fabby I don't know how he's going to deal with the incoming attack Bishop takes the Knight is coming to F4 maybe F5 in the future as long as you don't blunder your king king G7 Rook h8 by the way hello oh my goodness and Fabby just keeps going on the queen side it's it's like a poker player I mean right it's like it's like it's like triple when you triple down when you better pre flop you bet on the Flop you bet on the turn you bet on what is that triple barrel triple bullet triple bullet I think it's not triple barrel what is even what even is a triple barrel I don't know and Fab's just like only playing on that side of the board meanwhile Danga is just is just coming in he's Street takes the Knight now he's just a pawn up just a clean Pawn up fbby has to trade Queens takes and takes but kudos to Fabiano because he kind of stopped Black's attack for a pawn cost and now he just keeps he just keeps going and apparently instead of King G7 black had to go here that was a major moment in this game he had to get rid of this bishop and then Fabby would have had to sack a pawn what and the idea of sacrificing the pawn is that Black's got very weak Pawns so Rook F6 rook d8 and white suddenly continues to attack well that's kind of what happens when four out of five of your major pieces are standing on the back Rank and one of your five major pieces that isn't standing on the back rank is just stranded just locked itself outside of its apartment right I mean like Knight C6 where's the Knight going I mean Knight B3 is a little too slow buddy it's not going to work so Fabiano does a very nice job here cooling off the black attack and then continues to fire budon plays Bishop D7 right ABAB C6 and uh like all good games that had a lot of explosives and tension at some point what's going to happen is the players are going to fizzle out they start trading a lot of pieces a lot of Pawns come off the board and let's not forget Fab's down upon Pawn so to win it back he's got to make some trades both guys trade off more pawns rook and two versus rook and two with bishop and knight uh and fabbi did a very nice job here one more thing he pressured bug on Daniel on the clock you see 18 minutes versus 30 seconds that does not feel very good it's very difficult to claim you have an advantage when you're down 29 minutes to four okay he did his best but unfortunately or fortunately depending on who you're cheering for nothing happens in this game Fabby in a tiny bit of danger got out of it very quickly and these players are also tied for a draw yes penko versus uh vid GUI uh was another game that ended in a draw and the winner of this game out of nowhere emerging in a time for first place out of nowhere D4 param makulu of Iran versus Alexis Sana Russian grandmas currently representing Serbia uh this game a lot of pieces uh get traded off early but we have a very common nimso Indian where black is going to play Rook to C8 and is going to play Rook to d8 firing down on these files parama is going to try to open up the position maybe create an attack maybe utilize something over over here Here Comes Rook d8 Here Comes Rook C1 and the Knight goes to transfer over there param Knight E5 And Trades off the Knight and plays Queen to B3 now Queen C6 threatens mate shockingly white is not going to blunder it so that accomplishes nothing instead we have Bishop C6 fighting for the light squares and queen B7 potentially coming in the future wow Gotham how did you know that F3 white says you can't get me also so you can't actually touch any of my position and very simply white in the future would like to play Rook D2 Rook D1 E4 D5 so for example if Black Goes King h8 Rook D2 King here here King h8 E4 King here D5 now white is winning that is the way white is going to build up a plan in this position white doesn't always want to take on C5 but in some lines it might not be the worst thing why because after takes takes it's actually shockingly difficult for black to defend the C5 Pawn black has to like really bend over backwards to do that and none of us want to really see that so Rook D2 takes takes Queen A5 you see SRA firing at the center param staying solid right wants to advance very tense position can Parham break through this is known as the hanging Pawn structure so when you have DC versus EB both of Black's Rooks are staring at the pawns can white move anything A4 he's trying Rook C7 now he plays A5 the little decoy little Pawn sacrifice instead of Rook C7 the computer wanted Knight E8 can't explain that move not going to Rook C7 A5 and now that pawn gets traded but he's left black with a bit of a weakness and keep in mind my friends the only way white is going to win this game is by advancing here or something crazy is going to happen somewhere else all right maybe something else is going to happen Queen E3 still preparing Queen A3 uhoh who's guarding the pawn I got news for you he's giving it up but he's trying to create count play so Braham has to block kicks out the queen okay still nothing H nothing okay Queen B4 slow and steady at some point something's going to have to move we're going to an end game queens and Bishops versus Queen Bishop Knight but now in comes the queen very tough position to defend baram advances with yet another Pawn the constant threat of these pawns is making it very difficult for black to do anything else Queen A8 King H2 the king is safe Bishop D2 rerouting backwards Queen C7 look I'm I'm telling you the second that white pushes one of these pawns the game is going to be in a critical situation and on move 53 after many many many Preparatory moves C5 occurred and yes black can play Queen E1 check but after King to H3 Queen H1 you just cocoon this is crazy look at this the Knight can't get close the bishop somehow can't get close the pawn could try but after takes takes the pawn also can't get close and I'll play C6 so it happened I told you that move we were preparing for that move for some 20 moves the sides Clash the king hides the Knight is going to fall the pawn is going to promote ladies and gentlemen 62 moves 62 moves but the game is over because he's threatening Bishop F5 and after you take D5 and nobody can stop the pawns looks like black has counterplay but I come here then I come here and I play D7 and the game is over yes B4 looks possible and looks like you but I'm always queening first I am always queening first and so after d uh D5 s resigned and Pam makulu out of nowhere tied for first place six and a half points out of nine crazy stuff absolutely crazy stuff now this game on the women's side also somebody fighting for first uh and then we will give you a major update about Raman xal mAh your favorite chess player of all time an stanova playing against V rames Babu she is the older sister of one prag nand rameshbabu and she recently got her third grandm norm and she's destroying this tournament but she may get slowed down by the veteran experiened player aneta stefanova bashali is some 20 points away from uh The Grandmaster title she just needs to cross 2500 and against this obscure move order choice in the opening she plays B5 and the idea of B5 is to stop white from playing C4 now white still tries to play C4 but now black gets to play imp peasant takes D5 and white advances gets the Knight to C6 and trades off this bishop with takes takes Queen B7 white is going to be able to secure vali's Bishop Vali of course castling here is principal but black plays energetically C trying to get white to take so she could quickly activate her pieces takes takes now we have the following position both sides hate castling here by the way kids are watching the same kids that might go to the chess kid national festival more info in the description castles C takes Knight takes this is our position very boring actually same exact structure on both sides uh not much to play for at some point white is going to have to Castle she still refus refuses to Castle the Knight now goes to oh the Knight doesn't go anywhere look at that the queen is hitting this Knight if Pawn takes actually this is a zishan in between check and then you take the Knight but are we heading for a game where both sides are going to trade the pieces the Knight is getting pinballed around and finally White Castles finally White Castles Rook C5 Rook C1 Rook C8 very tense position and here white can play E5 and the idea of E5 is there's pins all over the place and also if Knight takes E5 you can play Rook takes and you say well what is the big deal apparently Knight D4 is the big deal the Knight is hanging and it's actually very difficult to defend the other idea of this is you activate the Rook so for example Knight C7 Rook B7 Rook C1 shck Bishop comes back and white is actually very happy according to this the stockfish dude all right according to the stockfish dude but she goes here and now sensing her opportunity Bal decides with seven minutes on her opponent's clock it's time to attack this is a declaration of hostilities Vali got up from the board at this point and punched her opponent Square in the face no she didn't she's a very nice person also the police would have been involved I don't know if there are any police on the aisle of man but maybe like three officers uh two are asleep one just works the you know one works the shift at a time H5 and then here comes the Knight Queen A3 stops Knight F3 check no it doesn't because if takes then this so the King has to go here now in comes the Knight now the position is still equal but they got five minutes on the clock white trades Rooks black takes back Rook D1 Vali escapes with an extra Pawn But Here Comes Queen F3 they're both playing the top computer moves rookie five top computer move Vali is a pawn up but the reason why white has so much compensation here is Black's position is a little bit in in in in a disarray she's defending herself but she's got a lot of weaknesses Knight to D4 very tense game Queen B7 yet again the top computer move Knight to F3 very natural but she loses the pawn what she needed to play here was she actually had to go here Queen A6 and then Knight F3 attacking why because that would have deflected The Rook from the defense of the Knight the best move would have been Rook D5 takes takes Queen B8 check King H7 and this and apparently despite being a pawn down white is so active black has no winning chances but instead of that in a Time trouble she goes here and she loses the pawn on A5 and she tries to do the same sequence but she's just down two pawns now and Vali with a minute on her clock the players both make the 40th move bal's two pawns up in an end game she is two pawns up in an end game and she pushes the pawn all the the way down all the way down to A2 whes King has to hide and here comes Vali all the pawns flying down the board white can't take with the Rook because Black's Rook is going to move H4 H3 check the king hides but it's over this is a Zang a zugang position if white moves The Rook that way black will move and promote if white takes black will go here and promote and if white goes that way black goes here in this position stefanova resigned and Vali wins again she is now 2492 she is in first place alone seven points out of nine she is the winner in both sections so far with two more rounds to go and um the last game that I have for you she's also eight points away from becoming a grand master the incredible run of Raman Jal Mahan is not to be ignored yesterday uh he drew against Sam shankland 2700 he's drawn against SRA 2700 seon 2700 Ali Reza 2780 Anish giri 2760 a win over basam Amin 2680 and Alan picho 2650 his only loss of the tournament is to Vladimir FV this game against Duda gets another 273 rated opponent we have an Italian we have a structure where a very quick opening expansion occurs with D5 ramazan has equalized but it's a very tense position look at Duda Knight F5 inducing a move and comes back now in this position probably black should take black also has this interesting move C4 and if takes you can take with the Knight you can take like this and after a long sequence the computer claims Black is actually doing very well despite being a pawn down but ramazan plays Bishop C7 and we get a position that explodes completely explodes in the center of the board you got to be very very precise here he takes Duda takes back and now apparently black can just go here looks very unpleasant because of this but after this apparently everything is well protected and black is doing okay but instead of taking first ramazan plays KN F4 and that allows an extra option for Duda to take with the Knight Bishop takes Pawn takes and yes ramazon gets his Knight to D3 and yes he gets his Pawn back but white has too much activity he has good pressure he has pressure over here F4 F5 H4 H5 Knight H5 KN F5 a lot of good interesting attacking possibilities and unfortunately ramazan gets lost in the complications and it's over before it begins Bishop E3 he tries to trade the Queen the queen activates he plays Queen B5 and the bishop hits the queen and there is nothing black can do if he plays Queen D he could take on B2 Free Pawn but after this he's going to lose the Knight and if he plays Queen D5 just F4 Queen's caught in no man's land and unfortunately the ridiculous run of the kazak 20-year-old has been halted for now he's lost his second game he's looking a little bit shakier than he did earlier in the event but he's got two more rounds to make up for it I hope he can get at least one more draw and at least another win against the 2600 cuz I'm not ready for the journey to end this was his obviously his worst game of the tournament that I'm not insulting the guy I'm just saying objectively speaking after such a crazy run he nearly was undefeated for eight rounds but now he can rest and we are all cheering for him I mean I'm cheering for him I don't know about you guys all right I'm cheering for the guy so uh that's all I have to say round number nine in the books let's get a little standings update here Andre yeno Karo vidit Fabiano bogdon Daniel deak and Pam maksud L six and a half out of nine and then we have six more players tied with them uh tied with each other with six any of these players can qualify this is unbelievable stuff this this tournament is going to have a crazy conclusion and on the women's side we have Vali standing alone seven points with two people with six and a half Anam musuk tan we have a group of six pointers a group of five and a half Vali stands alone and with another win or two she's going to get that Grandmaster title amazing stuff my friends friendly
