the very first memory I have of my entire life where I start my life is me laying on my bloody mom's body looking up at my dad screaming at him you just killed my [Music] mom hello everyone watching and listening today I'm pleased to be talking to Mr Aaron Stark you might recognize him from his Ted Talk on YouTube which has got about 13 million views um Aaron went to some very dark places when he was a kid and a teenager and came from some very dark places uh at one point in his life he had formulated very detailed plans that related to shooting up a school and he decided not to do it and what we're we're talking about what we're going to talk about is how he came to make those plans let's say what the rationale for it was in the cause of those plans and then also why he decided to back away from the precipice and what the consequence of that backing way has been so Mr Stark you turned your life around yes sir okay so let's go back to when it wasn't turned around now you've been touring around and talking to people for how how long how long have you been in the public eye um about 5 years about 5 years how old are you now uh 44 okay and so well why don't you just tell us the story and and and then I'll start delving into well the details well so I was almost a school shooter when I was really young my I went through a really violent aggressive family my uh first five years or like living in a Stephen King movie my birth father was the most violent depra person I've ever met um beatings and rapes and just violence and aggression the entire time running from him across state to state trying to get away um when my mom finally escaped him got with my stepdad and went from Stephen King to Scarface so it went from extreme violence to crack cocaine and crime and you were about six I was about five or six at the time yeah um and I had an older brother who's two years older than I was and so we were very nomadic I went to 30 or 40 different schools I we were constantly moving from state to state running away from the cops or the um social workers or counselors or anybody trying to intervene and lived a very nomadic lifestyle and went from early on being a really shy sensitive sweet kid who liked reading comic books and superheroes and and that kind of stuff to in my early teen years really adapting that to the way to survive was I'm going to be the aggressive one I I I knew I I figured out early on that I was the dirty one I was the nasty one I was the worthless I was the outcast I was the one that was pushed off early on meaning when six 7 years old that I my my older brother you were assuming it was you oh yeah it was me um my older brother was two years older than I was because of my family Dynamic he had a lot of responsibility he had to be an ear the early man of the house really early on to the extent where he had at 12 years old had to handle the um Sheriff throwing all of our stuff in the front Yan and evicting us while my parents are getting drugged out and drunk at the bar and we can't find him for days and he has to find us a place to stay and I was the responsibility how much older than you was he two years so he was 12 I was 10 and so he was just another kid going through abuse the same way I was um but he had to he I was a responsibility he had to take care of so while he was shouldering all the responsibility I'm like the burden and so that was kind of the identities we adapted he was the one that took care of everything I was the one that was the broken thing that needed to be taken care of all the time and as That Grew Older I I became more and more toxic going into my early why do you think there wasn't enough responsibility also for you like why did the why do you think the rules between you and your brother had to be split that way I don't know if they had to be but that's just kind of the way they ended up being I I the um he just because of our personalities he was more of a Hands-On kid he he well he he like he was a Gearhead too his his likes were more were more physical he liked doing things like building things taking stuff apart fixing cars stuff like that I was more intellectual I liked reading and loved I I would read like The Bu mythology textbook when I was four or five years old I my first book report was on Stephen King's misery when I was in kindergarten and because by I I read really early on super early I was reading I was reading full books by the time I was 5 years old and the um so I was I would suck in information so that was my Escape my Escape when all the crime and the violence and people beating each other and digging through crack rock for crack rock behind me was going on I would have my nose dug into an X-Men comic book my brother would be into taking part of skateboard putting the skateboard back together right so he was more oriented doing practical things World practical things in the world and so when as that gal he was the one that had to do like well the car is broken Jake's gonna try to fix it the this this thing's busted Jake's gonna fix it I didn't fix anything I was off to the side reading a book I was out like I wasn't I was more practically oriented I wasn't utilitarian to to anything I okay so you said you were a sweet kid but that things started to change well maybe about when you were 10 if I got that right oh earlier I'd say 7 8 n yeah I I because of the way that we moved we were constantly moving from Colorado to Oregon back and forth and this was the late 80s so it was before the age of the internet was really easy to make up your entire personality and make up a whole new identity so my parents would get a job in a house out here in Colorado and then get evicted lose their job move to Oregon lie about their entire resume lie about their entire history get an entire new house and everything and then wash repeat every couple of months right right and so we were always moving back and forth and and they were doing that so that their scams could continue it was either their scams could continue or they would evade U um accountability they were trying to so that sort of behavior is Gen generally rarer among women you said your birth father was a particularly nasty piece of work yes and so did you have did you have any sort of quality relationship with your mother or your father at that time yes early with with my father Yes my mom at that time was much more like Linda Hamilton from T2 okay I don't from Terminator she was the survivalist mother who like to the point where when my my father was so violent and chasing us around we were bouncing from batter woman shelter to batter woman shelter to get away from him and my mom would have things like um safety words so if we were out about if she just said the word pocket in conversation that was a safety tag so she could be at the grocery store like oh 2.95 here we go pocket if that word came out of her mouth I was to grab grab the back pocket of her pants and we need to get out right now that me my father was in insight there was trouble we need to go now we need to move and so it was that kind of survivalist and that was the first five years first five years of so why do you think your mother stayed with your father during that fiveyear period during that fiveyear period I think that from my stories that I heard he was a Vietnam vet and when I was when he left to go to the war he was a good guy when he came back he was kind of a monster oh yeah and so that was I guess was she with him before he went to Vietnam was she already established a Rel already established a relation with damaged by was then damaged by the war came back and was completely a monster and was just violent got into um he was epically violent what was he hurt physically do you know during the war he he wasn't hurt physically during the War I don't think I know he was hurt psychologically during the war he do you know why do you know what happened he was a gunner on a ship he was one of the ones that would load the the bomb the um ammunition to shoot up off into Cambodia and he was on the the ship and one of his best friends got his head taken off right next to him just the ammunition was blw as for best friend away right next to him and that messed him up but that wasn't that pales in comparison to the trauma he suffered from his family my father from his own family was circumcised at 15 years old okay so what does that mean exactly he they they circumcised him they cut off the forkin of his penis at 15 years old because they caught him masturbating I see so that that's the just an example of the abuse that my father went through so that's abuse in my opinion is generational it's trauma that rolls downhill and that both from both sides in my family there were giant Boulders of trauma that were rolling downhill from my father's side there was that from my mother's side I had a pedophile great-grandfather a pedophile Uncle rapist that there was a lot of violence and aggression on both sides and lot alism lots of alcoholism mental disorders lots of a lot of personality disorders a lot of drug abuse yeah yeah well patterns of behavior are imitated right consciously and unconsciously and what that means is that if there is a pattern of pathology in a family it will echo down the generations until someone digs into the underbelly of the problem sorts it out and stops it and then at least in principle that'll stop the intergenerational transmission there are genetic predispositions but complex a so you can have a genetic predisposition to depression which would mean that you're likely to be higher in the trait neuroticism which is a trait associated with negative emotion there are also heritable Tendencies towards antisocial personality so if you're extroverted and disagreeable and even worse if you're extroverted disagreeable and unconscientious if you take a pathological turn you'll tilt likely in a criminal Direction and some of that has a heritable element too it doesn't mean that wrongdoing or the proclivity for criminal behavior is heritable precisely it means that we inherit different patterns of traits that predispose us to different categories of Temptation you might say right yeah the way I present it to my family is that we are taught different languages of how to express our different our emotions and if if if your vocabulary of of emotional expression is violence and aggression then that's the language you're going to teach everybody else yeah well Al means that you don't know the Alternatives precisely and and so it's it's really hard to express yourself in a Comm rational manner if only the only language you speak in your head and outside and in your world is violence aggression and toxicity it's really hard then to yeah well it's also difficult for people who are temperamentally more aggressive to learn how to integrate that aggression in a socialized manner so if you have a small child who's extroverted and disagreeable they're going to push you and they're going to test constantly now if you take a firm Tack and you're sophisticated you can help those children become socialized and competitive in which case their proclivity to push can be well usefully channeled into you know competitive Victory let's say but it's hard to do that especially when the kid if the kid's particularly pushy and I I see that privity to push actually manifests itself in a large scale from my estimation from what I've seen doing what I do um in kids who are in that dark place that are in that gray area of depression that might fall into the dark even further that are trying to reach out for help the people that reach out to help too they're going to test they're going to push they're going to see are you Funk are you are you are you are you lying to me like everybody else in my life said they were here for me and then they disappeared when everything got heart and so they're going to really test and test and test until you prove consistency and so that that proclivity to test could if if you don't address that early on that it just sprouts and grows GNA be exacerbated betrayal yeah it turns into a main um defense mechanism and and lifestyle that that you're going to you're going to push and be aggressive to everybody until you can see that one person that actually can stand there yeah well people can people who have been betrayed and rejected sufficiently can get to the point where they won't make a bond with anyone right there there was there's research conducted I can't remember the people who did it on children who were separated very young for too long from their parents and they go through a period of protest that's very intense to begin with of course they're distressed about being separated and then the protest Behavior decreases but it'll emerge sporadically and then that'll decrease and once the protest Behavior has been eradicated completely it's very difficult even if the parent comes back to reestablish contact the children put up a barrier which is akin to the barrier that you're describing that's very difficult to pierce and as you said what'll happen too to children who abandon is that because they've been betrayed repeatedly and deeply and hurt very badly is they will test like mad to see if they can break the bond to see if it's reliable and it that can actually get to the point you see this in conditions like borderline personality disorder where the person will test everyone so completely that no one can actually put up with it yeah ex and and see that quite a lot and and I I think that the more we can that that's the advice that I give them when I get doing my talks is that be that island of normal in the ocean of chaos that person that person is everybody when I was in that spot everybody in my life thought that I was either a monster or a project you either wanted to fix me or you afraid of me and if if neither one of those were a person and so yeah well a project is often some that people undertake for their own self- glorification precisely and and if I'm if if I'm just a mark on your checklist and and I'm not actually I'm an activity to you I'm not I'm not a person you're engaging with and a rational response and listening to my and having a rational reasonable discussion and discourse I'm an activity on your checklist and and that means that I'm automatically under you when we have activities and we're doing things that activity is is a thing we are doing well that's the toxicity of pity M the toxicity of pity demoralizing reason it is and the thing that my best friend did and he's still my best friend to this day was he was the one person that saved my life by treating me like I was a respectful person that deserved when did you meet him I met him when I was 10 okay so did you have friends before being before the age of 10 I not really I well it's hard with an itinerant lifestyle yeah yeah I didn't have any real connections and then even after that once I once once they that slightly stabilized in my teen years the moving down slowed down a little bit was able stay place for slightly longer I didn't really gather friends I got what I called disaster groupies they were people that wanted to kind of live vicariously through my darkness cuz they didn't didn't really have anything like me in their world so we were there was a bunch was that like a group of outcasts yeah it was a bunch of bunch of Team kids yeah so well me and maybe one or two others that had a similar kind of background because there it was looking back it was a bunch of depressed kids trying to navigate depression without any adult supervision but it was in in reality what was going on was there was a house that one of my friends at one of my classmates at school his Dad paid the rent his dad bought all the food but his dad didn't live there so it was just my 16-year-old friend and his little brother that stayed there and so that turned into just for a bunch of kids and so that was everybody else there guance no guidance whatsoever and so that that turned into where all the other kids had houses and had families and could go there they were they were rebelling they were they were they were trying to find their own way these all the other kids all the other kids in the group they were like rebelling and stuff I didn't have a house to go back to I was going to go back sleep in the field behind cab Bonita in Denver I was I was going to go try to steal free samples out of the grocery store and evade my criminal family if I did if I did hit my family's house it was to grab a couple little bit of clothes so I could get out of there before the violence started so I wasn't I wasn't going home to any stability I was going to go live on the streets and I was going to go try to survive they all got to go home to their houses and so in that so you were in this right like neck deep and they playing with it just exactly exactly they they were they were playing it with it I was living it fully MH and that that kind of they were like pushing me further off on the edge it was like a real life Reddit for him it was like were you getting rewarded so to speak for your more the darker parts of your personality yeah rewarded so to speak in a social sense where it's it's like it turns into like a party favor almost like let me tell you the craziness of what happened to my day yeah you had a friend like that who was extraordinarily comedic and and he was he was probably the funniest person I've ever met in my life and it got at one point it got to be a burden to him because that's what people expected they expected him to be on and funny all yes I've had that time where I'm at a party and like oh up tell me what craziness your family went through today I'm like I don't want to talk about it dude I got Cuts in my arms from it like I don't want to talk about this pain right now yeah but it it would turn into the to the to the fiction but so when we're talking about that that that leads into the toxicity of what fed my own anger toxicity and depression with going into that spot because I by that point when I that was I started doing that when I was 14 years old okay what year is this do so I was 14 years old I was born in 1979 so we're talking 993 93 okay just to just to place it just to place it and you're in Denver at this point yep Denver and 14 14 years old and that's when I finally left home because I couldn't deal with the violence and the crime and the beatings constantly and watching my mom stab my uncle in the gut with a doorknob if you take AP part a doorknob the inside gear parts that pointy yeah that makes a very dangerous weapon don't ever stab someone with it um and so just violence like that constantly like like what does constantly mean like living in that figh ORF flight response every minute of every day okay how often did you see events that were violent in your house three or four times daily and what kind of violence to the point where here here's an example I'm sitting in my bedroom and I nobody had seen that I came home from school or I think I was working a day job I think I was 15 or 16 at the time I walked in sat down in my bedroom nobody heard that I was home I picked up the game controller was playing PlayStation for a second heard a rumble outside my bedroom and I stand outside and my stepdad has my mom up against the wall by her throat it's dangling like threw two feet off the ground and she's he's choking her and so I immediately grab him I'm large my just H hit puberty so I was big I was getting into my body grabbed him slammed him into the microwave broke the microwave pushed him back slammed him into the fridge broke the fridge pushed him back into the back wall then I had him by his throat up against the wall choking him and now my mom is smashing plates over the back of my head for me to drop him she's she's attacking me because I got into the fight so I drop him go back to my video game pick up the game controller keep on playing nothing happen like go you go from Z to 60 instantly right right right and then go back to nothing and do that four or five times a day and in at the drop of a hat stuff can go wrong and at the same time dealing with my parents their method of of discipline or any kind of control was to threaten the absolute worst possible thing right that's not I'm going beat you terribly I'm I'm I'm going to beat you terribly I'm going to kick you out you're going to gone you're going to be out of here immediately and then 5 minutes later act like nothing happened they wouldn't follow through with any kind of punishment but act like nothing happened in that conversation at all and we were just having a good day diversify your savings with physical

was 12 I didn't they how are you going to tell me to be home by 10:00 when you're digging through the crack the carpet for crack rock in front of me yeah because they didn't think they didn't want to hide anything so they did it all right in front of me they would pull out the the the flat iron why didn't they want to hide anything that was just my mom's philosophy she just didn't didn't believe it hide that's like a warped form of honesty she yeah she would pull out the electric skillet with the water and the vials and the baking soda and I watched her Rock up crack right in front of me I learned how to do it when I was 5 years old I took crack to school was a SE and tell for one of my school that's not generally a very good idea no it isn't right but that would also indicate how much you didn't know how strange what was going on in your family actually was and it was part of what built into me that help was a Peril that reaching out for help was a danger okay that it was there because I when I would do that when I would I took crack rock to school and then the next day we're out we moved out of state and so as as another example I was really I I was very unkempt very dirty very smelly I wasn't i' never had had clean clothes I never changed my my clothes I would constantly be filthy and there was one school I was I went to I must have been 9 10 years old or pre really young and I went to the school and on the walk to the school I actually defecated in my pants and kept on going I crapped my pants and kept on going to school and so I walked went to school spent the entire day there the next day I go to school and there's a box of stuff for me okay the teacher had brought a box of stuff they brought clothes and books and coat and all these new school supplies I take it home and I show my mom like hey check out I got all this stuff yeah the very next day we're out we moved away because that's the sign the teacher got too close that someone's investigating too fast and we need to go so I see it turned into a danger signal that if I'm if I'm if I reached out for help someone attending to you if I reached out for help that meant that the police might get involved my parents might go to jail my brother might go to foster care I might go to foster care all because I tried to get help right right so so okay so let's go back to between 1 and 5 you talked a little bit about your M your dad you said your dad was particular to Dam in Vietnam your mom had established a relationship with him before he went so I imagine she felt somewhat beholden to him and also I would imagine maybe she loved him certainly she would have felt sorry for him when he came back because he was so damaged and so how did they how did the two of them spiral into the trouble that they had and then when did you and your brother come along like they were they married they were married they did get married they were married by the time I was born the extreme violence had already started so I'm not sure about how that spiraled in I have memories early on of my father sleeping on the on the on the couch and my mom realizing he's finally asleep so she picked up a 2x4 and beat him bloody beat him almost till he was dead because she tried to escape and she when so she beat him in how old do you think you are I was four and you can remember that mhm I remember him beating I remember him laying on the couch and her over him slamming into him with a 2x4 I remember that and then us going and but then he found us and the okay you left but he found you he found us and and he would chase us down so there was a there was a there's a distinct memory I have of us in a Boman shelter me and my mom and my older brother were living in a batter woman shelter and me and my brother playing outside okay and a car pulls up and my dad kidnaps me and my brother takes us kid convinces me particularly to get into the car I'm pretty sure my brother just followed us I just get in the car CU it's my dad MH and so he takes us and then calls the batter woman shelter talks to my mom tells my mom that one of us are dead and the other one's going to be dead if she he he she doesn't show up at this restaurant to meet him okay and so she against the protestations of the batter woman shelter of course she goes there to meet him at this restaurant and when she gets there and I know I know the story both from Vivid recounts from her from the story and from news clippings that we had growing up um so she gets to the goes to the restaurant and he's there and he pulls he they're arguing and he flips the table over in the argument pulls out his classic weapon which was a cross-shaped x-shaped tire iron that's was his that was weon Choice oh yeah so he picked that up and went to go hit her with it and right then everybody else in the uh restaurant pulled out guns and pointed at him because the bad woman shoulder called ahead and filled it with undercover police officers and so I had had a news clipping when I was a kid of my dad getting LED out of a restaurant with shotguns at his head are are your mom and dad still alive my mother is my father I don't know and my stepdad died in 201 15 do you still see your mom no I haven't spoken to her since I came out with my story last time last time I talked to my mom I was I had just left a live TV show appear parents in Denver I was having a really good moment I just was on live TV for the first time took my daughter with me she got to see a TV studio so I was having a cool little how many kids do you have four four kids how old are they 23 20 16 and 12 the two older my step 16's my and you're married uh 13 years 13 years and how has your marriage been great fantastic really yeah congratulations I am as happy as can be and I successfully broke the cycle my family doesn't have any of the trauma that I went through okay good well we'll get into how you did that okay so now back when you little your mom and dad are in a very violent relationship they're married your dad obviously wants you guys around for some reason like I think it was more to control her I didn't think it have anything to do with us CU once we were gone he didn't care he he never he never came he never came to contact I never had any time where Dad tried to reach out never had any of those loving conversations I don't have any loving memories with my father the very you had no relation the very first memory I have of my entire life where I start my life is me laying on my bloody mom's body looking up at my dad screaming at him you just killed my mom oh yeah that's where I start that's not a good that's yeah Alfred Adler a famous psychologist he he believed that those first memories in some ways are determinative right that they sort of set the frame and so that's a hell of a first memory mhm yeah yeah now you had your older brother did you have a relationship with him I did we were pretty close growing up okay so you had a you had a male role model in the house who wasn't completely pathological do you see your brother I haven't talken to him since I started talking about it that side of the family attacks me not because I'm saying something that's not the truth but just because I'm talking because I there and your brother as well doesn't feel that that's appropriate because I'm because I'm making my mom cry because I see and so he feels that's inappropriate in relationship to your mother does he still see your mother I believe so yeah I don't know I haven't spoken to any of them I haven't spoken to that side of the family in five years five years years okay so when you're little how do you survive between one and five like you have your brother so that's definitely a plus okay and you said that you were a very early reader so so you escaped into the world of fiction and reading yep so comic books and you do well in school I so I tested off the the charts in my tests did you do any of my assignments I never well that's not surprising yeah well first of all that's not all that atypical for smart kids but you lived in a pretty chaotic environment so it would have been quite surprising had you managed to buckle down and do your work did you pride yourself on your intellect I did I did I I would carry around bullfinch's mythology with me all the time or giant stacks of X-Men comic books or the complete works of Shakespeare and just read viously and I love doing like oral reports and book reports and when I was in high school one at the final High School North High in Denver the um only two classes I ever actually attended were English class and choir class the I would I would skip every other day and I and I even failed those classes because of attendance rules once you miss four days you failed the semester oh yeah and I would only attend class once every three weeks or so but the classes I would go to were quite English class in choir class why choir choir because I think that actually has a superpower when it comes to kids who are depressed I did you sing I did I I still do I still love singing um and I I was in Statewide choir and Citywide choir and 16 person Acappella choirs I would always go whenever all the schools I would go to I would go to whatever the advanced choir was and try out for it because that's that's what I wanted to do what did they make of you in the choir because you said you were like an uncamp kid you you Dr badly you're dirty the teachers always put me in I I when I went to I went to Oregon one time and I managed as a freshman in high school to through a try out make it into the senior Acappella choir that was just a 16 person AC capella choir only for seniors and I was a freshman so you had literature and music to save you yep yeah did you listen to a lot of music I did who were your favorites um I oh I I'm very eclectic I like a wide range back then it was I liked a lot of oldies I liked I really liked the 50s music so I listen to a lot of like buddy Hol positive music yeah I listen to a lot of like Buddy Holly and that kind of stuff and the labomba soundtrack I play that a lot um and then I didn't really like the 80s style music the poppy kind of stuff I didn't really like that but I got into metal when I was older so the 9 Inch Nails downward spiral album is pretty much an autobiography like that's that's pretty much the how my life was going at the time and so it was when I was a teen it was 9inch Nails Marilyn Manson uh panta tulle that kind of stuff right right so the dark end of the metal Spectrum but the more intelligent end of the met I wasn't really into the death metal screaming anger kind I was into the stuff that was talking about the emotions I liked I like singers that have heart so like Credence clear water revival yeah some some when you sing it it feels like it's digging in your soul yeah yeah yeah they're great their music has aged very well tooed Clear Water yeah yeah yeah so okay so one to five you had no relationship with your father except one that was extremely negative all you saw from him was violence you had some relationship with your mother do you think your mother loved you yeah yeah some of that's where the only time I have good memories with my mom is during that time the best memory I have with my mom ever is sitting watching willly Wonka's chocolate factory and singing every single song and we knew I I knew every word to that movie so I would sit there and sing the entire movie and we would go back and forth with the songs and that was the best memory of my childhood that's that's the highlight of those years and are you during that time 1 to 5 are you playing with any kids or are you playing with your older brother you remember any play no no no not really any play just just reading I wasn't much of a player everybody else would go out and play and I'd sit with my CLE with my books oh so okay so you were you were now let me ask you some questions about your personality if you don't okay introverted or extroverted then or now that's changed eh mhm were you introverted be before or were you just you just afraid of people that's a good question I I I don't think I was afraid of people people think I was well back then I was because it took a while for me to burn that out of myself I when I in my teen years I think that I lost the ability to get embarrassed or ashamed or afraid of anybody because when I was a kid I made fun of myself more than anybody else did very self-deprecating yeah that's good trick I had a better fat joke than you did better insult than you did and so yeah it would be surprising to me if you were introverted as a kid because you appear to be very extroverted you smile a lot you talk quickly I don't think that it would I don't think introverted would have fit but I don't I wasn't extroverted I was I would I kept to myself pretty much but I liked the Arts so okay so maybe what happened was that your interest in literature let's say in the Arts was so strong that if you had to choose between being with people and reading you picked reading yes yes because I always wanted to learn more stuff I I wanted I I like to I I I even now I'll be walking listening to I just finished uh um Lawrence krauss's book edge of knowledge which so like bleeding edge pH physics and Science and philosophy your podcasts and I listen to I listen to a wide range of topics and I try to I try to get the entire spectrum of of opinions so I'll listen to the farthest right the farthest left someone in the middle all all different sides of the topics and try to try to see the the whole side of it and yeah so these days I'm just I'm all over with it but I I don't think that back then I was introvert I think you might have hit the nail and well very open tentative people okay um are you compassionate polite or tough and and and stubborn yes which one yeah if you had to pick um so in general I would think I'm compassionate and polite however it because of the the survival mechanisms and the the way I had to live a long time I can turn on that hard note pretty easily where I I I can easily cut people out of my life I can easily decide that you that it's done and you are you're hurting me more than you're good and I've given up My Philosophy these days they give up too much time of my life to people that hurt me so I just don't do it anymore and so I these days are you likely to be taken advantage of or not no not now not now not now before I don't think so but I can't say no because I might have been yeah okay I I you said when you were in school you never did your assignments now there are obviously situational reasons for that are you are you a conscientious person dutiful orderly industrious or more easy going kind of half and half I I tend to go my wife is the one that does all the planning so that's the best way to put it when I'm when when I'm doing my events and stuff my wife sets up the the planning makees sure I have my she'll do theing she'll do the scheduling I handle the the material of it yeah and the um I'm order detailed about certain things but I'm very non-materialistic very very non-materialistic nothing in my world matters physically it's all about experiences and it's all about memories so like i' I've had at more than five times in my life I had people burst in my bedroom at 3:00 in the morning with a duffel bag screaming at me we have five minutes to get out of here we need to grab everything and go and so everything I had disappeared because the only thing I would grab had time to grab is comic books so I would lose all the toys I had or all the TV I had or all the different books I had I'd lose everything except for my comic books and so over the years nothing none of the material stuff matters to me m and so it's really hard for to buy me like my my my wife says I'm the hardest person to buy a Christmas present for cuz I don't want anything to to give me the things that I want yeah that's about it yeah but a memory take me out on a trip give me a memory give me something fun right so you're very high in openness right creativity interest in ideas and interest in aesthetic experience yeah so learning right and that was one of the things that seems to have saved you that you could that you you found that Niche and that was something you could do alone and you could even do that that when you were moving from place to place yep and it was and it was a deep Escape so I there could be abject violence happening right next to me and I could be buried reading about what happened with Mike crawler and the Xmen you ever watched the documentary crumb yep I love crumb Albert crumb yeah yeah or Robert Robert Crum well crumb you know what Crum did reminds me a bit of what you did because he took refuge in his R and that really saved him you know he had life he had a wife he had a child he had a career I mean Jesus he's got a dark side that gu and is he came from one brutal family man it's rough so but he had that creative Escape that sounds like it was there for you okay so we covered a bit of of your life from 1 to five and you you talked about things starting to turn on you around eight something like that so yeah so well that's when we got so the there's three steps in that right to from 5 to 7 there's a there's like three steps that happen because my the way my my mom did it is she escaped My Father by sending me I don't I don't know how she actually got wi of him because we went to Oregon she sent me and my brother to Oregon for a year and by ourselves just flew us out to Oregon to go live with grandparents with grand oh and did you have a relationship with your grandparents with my grandmother yes but that was the one of the most toxic times of my life in that year of Oregon because that sent me out to go live with my pedophile rapist Uncle that's right during that time so so there was no Escape dur no escaping that and that's that's when I figured out that that trauma Hill is huge in my family that there's a large mountain of abuse like my grandfather his name is HL because that's the only two letters that his mom knew how to write when he was born because she gave birth at 13 in the Ozarks so she that that trauma Hill is big and that they that so it wasn't positive at all and so when we finally came back from that after a year of that my mom brought us back and she had got with my stepdad and my stepdad was a did she divorce your father I I think I I don't I don't know I think she but she's with another guy this is now your stepdad yep yep and so um he is a smooth talking criminal he is a a manipulating lying oh smooth talking can selling ice to an esimo kind of guy he's the kind of guy that that will lie and steal every day all the time right right and but also gets heavily involved into drinking when I met him he was in prison for strong arm robbery he spent four years in prison for strong round robbery he would steal entire delivery trucks that were going to to grocery stores and take all the stuff and go sell it at the flea market so why do you think your mother picked him and do you know how they met I mean she's already hanging around in the dark side of the planet so I I imagine she had the opportunity to run into people like him I I think they met at a bar and I think when they met at a bar he heard about my father and was like oh yeah I'll keep him away and it turned it was started as a protective thing I see so she found one monster to keep another one at Bay yep aha do you think that he was a project for her or an adventure or no no you you think the protection thing was genuine I think I think the protection thing was genuine at first and then it turned into a trauma bond from all the the uh drugs so he might have you said he was a narcissistic manipulator he offered her an escape that was false yes yes right and okay and she stayed with him for how long until he died he died in 2017 in the most 16 or 17 the most fitting way possible that that drunken drugged out violence never stopped in my family and they were having an argument while they were high and drunk and he went to the bathroom had an aneurysm collapsed in the floor and crapped all over himself laid there for three hours while she screamed at him from the living room how worthless he was I really can't think of a more fitting way for the guy to end that's why did she stay with him why did she stay with him yeah you think she thought she could she had she had severe lack of of um self-respect and sense of self- accomplishment she didn't think she could do it she didn't think she could survive without him she thought that she was broken and couldn't do anything without her she the and and he over the years had kind of built that into her right right and I see just she just thought that he was indispensable and she couldn't do anything without him and so we we tried me and my brother me and my brother tried to have interventions I personally had an intervention with him by by the age of 14 15 years old I'm big in beating him up now because like I said I was I was on from home I was living on the streets but I was home occasionally because I had to come home to recharge okay so when were you with your grandparents 1 that was no I was with my grandparents from 5 to six oh so okay five to six and then so F first to five father one year with my grandfather and then back home with my with my stepdad with your stepdad and then it was my stepdad on and when did you get big 13 years old oh how big 6 foot 280 lb oh yeah oh yeah so that was handy I got big fast and right right but I was also quiet shy and sensitive and didn't know how to use it at the time so I got picked on constantly I get used to get go go to school and get bullied all the time I would get beaten at school come home with bruises all over me and I never defended myself I would never stand up for myself why why why why didn't you defend yourself I I don't know I I started defending myself one day when I snapped and a kid had slammed my head into a locker and I picked him up and kind of ragd dolled him and slammed him a bunch of times and I noticed when I did that after that for the next four or five months I was at the school I didn't have anybody B right right so that was the first time you realized that eh why do you think it happened then and hadn't happened before despite the fact that you were bullied I don't know I don't know I don't know I I think that I think it might have been because the chaos at home was really starting to spin up the that's that's right about the same time hit your limit you know have you ever read about people going berserk some yeah yeah yeah well it often happens to people people who are in a very chaotic environment who are being abused continually and they hit their threshold and it's something like a last ditch Do or Die response right it's like well I've tried to retreat that's not working I'm cornered I've got nothing to lose it's a very dangerous position to put someone in with the holiday season approaching why not include saving a baby's life on your Christmas list through our partnership with pre-born an organ gation that's rescued over 270,000 babies you can do just that every day pre-born network of clinics rescues 200 babies as they compete head-to-head with the abortion Giants you see they offer an [Music] abortion-inducing and more and now through a match your tax deductible gift is doubled too for up to 2 years you are offering double blessings now is the time to put your year-end write-offs to work have your donation matched by dialing pound 250 and saying the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or donate securely at preborn docomo that's preborn doccom [Music] Jordan and that's that's where I ended up being at the end of the story yeah I bet okay so at 13 you're fairly large and you learned one day at school that if you so that happened when I was about eight or nine when I when I ragged all that kid CU I I was I was still pretty big I was by that that was when I was about was five and a half foot tall and still pretty large I was growing into my body at that point right so I was still pretty big but that was when I first figured out that that if I lashed out the people would leave me alone I also right around that same time figured out that one of the first things it's I kind of do the reverse of what people talk about when they're going to prison you know when they talk about going to prison they think they're going to up to the biggest guy and try to fight him and then establish a role in the I would kind of do the opposite I go up to the biggest the most popular kid and then insult myself to him and then and make fun of myself to that kid uhhuh and kind of like establish the pecking order immediately like I go find the the biggest the whoever the the ring leader you did it with humor yeah well kind of self deating humor that nobody else found funny but me that kind of insulting kind of like I see so you go got the pecking order problem over with as fast as you Poss fast as possibly could and you you were willing at that point to accept a relatively low social position I knew I was by that point I had I had internalized that I was the low social I see I see so you thought you might as well just get it over with quickly yeah yeah I'm I'm going to end up well then you don't have the conflict yeah exactly the sooner I can resolve it the less fight right right right definitely the less bullying I'm going to go through if I can if I can establish myself right there and make it and if I can do that and make fun of myself I'm not an appealing Target cuz bullies only want to go after you if if you get a response out of you and they can make you cry so did that generally mean that you were left alone even though you were at low man on the totem pool kind of but it was more left alone at a stabilized level of ridicule okay like like left alone down here yeah you know what I mean like like it's it's not not left alone entirely like hands off he's okay we can't make fun of him anymore it's like we're going to make him fun of him right here but we're not going to pick on him down there cuz it's not he's not going to cry there's no there's no fun in that right so it's predictable low stat predictable predictable low status yeah that's a good one yeah well you see this you see that in in primate social troops too is that sometimes this is one indication of that is sometimes if an interloper comes in who Could disrupt the whole hierarchy you might think that that would be useful for the lower ranking primates because they would have an opportunity to move up but they'll generally resist the internal per two because the cost of social transition the conflict that goes along with social transition the cost of that can be so high that they would rather settle for the stable low status than the unpredictable transition yes that's that's a precise that that's a very AP description of what was going on with that I I would rather just be what I think I am I'm the worthless one I'm the one you're going to make fun of anyway I'm the fat smelly one let's get this out of the way and then I can go ahead and try to live try to be I'm going to be out of here less than six months anyway cuz I'm pretty sure my family's going to evaporate soon anyway right so it's temporary so let's just get this out of the way and we'll go and while you're doing that you're sving yourself so to speak with books and so forth yeah right yeah right have life and right around then that's when I really started to get more and more toxic and I really started to to between between 9 and 13 was really when I started to to become more I not toxic in the in in a um attacking way not like insulting everybody I'm around just unappealing and and and filthy and off-putting and and and just just like kind of like give off almost a xenophobic reaction like like kind of like just don't want to touch it kind of thing were you bitter I think I think looking back yeah I think I was well you had reason to be I mean it would be surprising you I didn't think I was then what did you think then I think I was just living I I I didn't have I didn't think that there was a tomorrow then I would regularly say that I felt my life was like I was watching a movie like I was like I'm sitting in the audience watching my movie pass by and it sucks and I don't have any real control over it like I well another description I would use is like I'm living in a tsunami of pain like I'm just slashing back and forth like I don't my feet are on First Response that's called derealization it's a symptom of trauma which is to see your existence as separate from you right and the Der realization is that this isn't and I don't know if this accurately sums up what you're you're saying but that this isn't real right you you're like a watcher yeah yeah it was felt very unreal it it felt very much like I am not in my movie I'm sitting in the audience and my movie is passing me by and every now and then it pulls me into a scene and I have to be in it but I'm not I'm not I don't have any script in this I'm not engaged in this at all well well yeah well that would also be reflective at least in part of the fact that you had almost no agency yeah right I mean you're being pulled from place to place it's not surprising that you felt that things around you were going on despite you because they were yeah right so and that's a very difficult thing to contend with when you're like nine yeah yeah and and my brother at the same time is getting a little more family status because he is assuming the responsibility he's the one that's handling getting the houses when we're getting evicted and he's the one that's handling the fixing the car and he's and he's also joining in so he starts doing drugs with my family and he starts drinking with them he's really early on he just joins in so I don't I don't at all I didn't why not I just I found it very unappealing found I I I would sit and watch those guys do it and I just was I never understood why you would sit there did you drink I not until I was in my 20s oh is that well that was that was a wise choice because you would have been in real trouble especially if you only drug I did as a teenager was LSD uhuh I tripped LSD when I was 16 years old but I didn't I didn't smoke weed till I was 19 uh-huh yeah uh-huh okay so now you're starting to change somewhat dramatically around 8 you said you start to become markedly consciously unappealing like trying to turn people off do you think but it started unconscious and then grad and not I wouldn't even say gradually it moved into conscious yes okay and what so what what were your conscious strategies and thoughts at that time I wouldn't bathe I wouldn't change my clothes I wouldn't I would I I wouldn't brush my teeth I would say the really inappropriate things about myself and about what was going on I would describe the stuff I was seeing in my house like blatantly around people and it was the just trying to be and I think it was again trying to establish that social pecking order on a constant basis well it's also an attempt it looks like an attempt also to bring what was happening to you anyways some degree of voluntary control right you didn't there wasn't any obvious way for you to improve it but one way to control it was to take well you might think to take ownership of it and what I don't know what that is though to make it even worse you know because in some ways you're spiting yourself well people will do that they'll punish themselves for being low status for example yeah yeah so yeah and and I knew that I belonged there and I and I really internalized that and the right so then you're worth taking care of either no I wasn't worth taking care of at all and and the at the same time the violence and Chaos at home is getting worse and worse like that's they are now entering late stage crack addiction and massive problems with alcoholism and the the degradation of the when you're an early drug addict it's all right because your body might be able to do it when you're 15 years in you're you're not as resilient in it it well you could imagine you could imagine you had a choice to make imagine this is the choice it's something like either there's something wrong with you and that's why what's happening to you makes sense or there's something unbelievably wrong with almost everyone in your family that goes back multiple Generations that's so deep that it's terrifying and that's the decision that I made the that's that's what I mean when I say I changed because that's the decision that flipped I went from thinking that it was me to realizing that it was that between 19 and 27 so that was that was that was what switched on you okay now you you've talked publicly quite a bit about violent the violent school shooter fantasies okay so detail that out to me do it chronologically so I can understand and and the philosophy as well cuz you're smart so the probability that you had a philosophy is very high so I'd like to know all of that so the um the well we'll start around theat 14 years old age when I'm living with that dis house when every all the teenagers are there cuz that's right around when that starts now you've got a gang kind of yeah we'll call it a gang that's a way to put it um and so i' I've got I've got enablers let's say psychological enablers with that and so I am I've now fully embraced that I'm the dirty fat one I like worn WRA the darkness around like a blanket and it's it's it's become my personality and now I the I started self Haring right around 14 years old what were you doing cutting I would start with light cuts on my arms and it started I think as an emotional regulatory thing when it would calm the tsunami it would it would when when I felt like I was completely out of control and that you yeah so let me ask you something about that CU I've wondered about that I've had clients who self hared I'm wondering tell me what you think of this hypothesis so imagine know that time you snapped so you could say you're out for blood mhm Okay so imagine that there's a part of your brain a relatively primordial part associated with defensive aggression which if pushed will only be satisfied with the sight of blood well so because it's many it's very common that people who self harm will state very specifically that unless they draw blood they won't re they won't calm down yeah no that's it's it's that's that the because it wasn't finished if you don't if you didn't draw blood you didn't do it and and that was that was very much it started with sacrificial gesture right to offer blood up to the gods of emotional storm in a way yeah and it would and and emotional storm is a good way to put it because it would really it would calm the tsunami it would like lower the thing it would maybe even not lower it would kind of like cut through that that fuzz with something that was Concrete in mind and even though I knew it was destructive and I knew doing it it was bad and it was hurting me it was still mine and it was real and nothing else in my life felt like it was real and so that that blood is real yeah yeah and the scars afterwards are real and the pain was real and the the cuts out the the the scabs were real and all of so that's interesting too because it that means that it also stood as an antithesis perhaps to that sense of derealization that you had yeah and and I was also at that time feeling a a strong sense of of anger at a complete lack of accountability for anybody in my world nobody in my world had any accountability or responsibility for anything when stuff went wrong they didn't have to deal with it they evaporated and started over they they didn't have to deal with the ramifications of the hell they were causing they just continued and continued and continued why do you suppose that bothered you and not them I don't know that I don't know I it really it really did start to bother me though that was a thing that was really getting to so that's a violation yeah yeah well I can understand that you know compl lack of of counter yeah when I see people in in my life in various places failing to be held accountable for their pathological actions it's I find that very very difficult especially when there's no not even any self reli not like not self- reliability self- acknowledgement not even any self-awareness that this is what's going on it's like a VI to me it's a violation of the intrinsic moral order yes it's a violation of our social contract the that we are supposed to at least engage in a r in a normal way where I'm supposed to if you say you're going to do something I can reasonably accept that that's what you're going to do not that you're lying to me and doing something else entirely behind my back and then getting away with and then getting away with it and smiling and doing it again and enjoying the fact that happened reing over like I had to sit and listen to them laugh about how the the lies that they were doing and how my stepdad was stealing he worked at a he would lose jobs over and over again because he would get a job steal everything from the job and go sell it and then lose the job again and I would sit and laugh and listen to them Revel about that and laugh about that stuff and it just angry and so I'm now in this yeah well everyone that uh everyone that Psychopathic Thief robs is a fool that's how they justify it well if you're so stupid I can steal from you then you're so stupid that you deserve it ex right everyone's a Rube and everyone's a Target and the person who's doing it is smarter than everyone else and they now take that phenomenon and imply that in that Dynamic to a depressed kid if you're depressed you deserve it because you're the worthless one and you should have deserved it yeah so so you're in a weird situation there because on the one hand you feel that strongly that people should be held accountable for their moral shortcomings but on the other hand you've accepted your role somewhat perversely as low status you've started to in some way Revel in it a little well you've adopted it voluntarily and you said you were pushing it to its limit you said you WRA the darkness around it it became a a a definite not only personality trait but survival technique right well it's an identity as well worked in this in this house that you were in it was I I was the dark unicorn house where where they didn't have anything like me but at the same time I was living three parallel lives at that exact moment okay cuz at that house dark unicorn where all the pain I was going through turned into a party favor it turned into some weird positive in a negative way yeah like negative positive toxicity yeah I've actually seen people like that and and so there there's that side then I have my home life where it's just abject hell and I'm the worst and I'm the bottom and I'm the cast off and I shouldn't even be there in the first place why the hell am even in the house then I have the other side which is I met at at 12 years old which is Mike and when I went to Mike's house Mike I so it's a very important character to bring him in the story right now so I met Mike when I was he was 10 I was 12 we met at a comic shop we bonded over comic books we we met we played we met playing the original Mortal Kombat 1 video game to time it out to see where what time it was um but we immediately bonded the first day we met immediately hooked we went I went to his house and basically never left we just deep conversation I was 12 he was 10 oh yeah and so we just hooked up and I just basically never left his house for a week why did his parents put up with you they were really at the time they were super sweet there they have lived in a giant four-story house they're both really well off his dad was a computer programmer his mom was a lawyer very very well to do um he was he was just they thought that I was just a sweet kid down the street I lived at the opposite end of the one of the blocks at that time so at the opposite of the block at one of the houses I lived in is what I meant and so we just bonded immediately became good friends and it started where we were I would stay there for weeks and his parents were fine with it and then over the years stay there for a couple days and they were okay with it by the time I'm 15 16 years old I can't stay there anymore because now I'm really dirty and filthy and if I sit on their couch they have to clean it when I I see so you're I see so you weren't so bad at the beginning MH I okay I was wondering why they would put up with you but I get the picture now so you were a more or less ordinary kid as far as they were concerned when when the relationship that was just his kid his son's friend at the at the start and I was having a rough life so they were going to try to give me all and then over the years as I went from 12 to to 13 14 15 that Arc that abusive Arc I was going on made me go down and made that and what's Mike doing during the time that you're declining he the whole time I've been friends with Mike he's never treated me like anything but an equal Mike did Mike would tell me constantly you're a good kid can I language in this podcast you say whatever you want you're a good kid in a world he would say over and over you're a good kid in a world and he that was like a constant refrain he would tell me all the time and over at his house and we would he we he would listen to me about my pain I was in listen to all the abuse and it was right around that time with this when the self harm started he would notice that I would come in with cuts and he wouldn't really ask but he would just like dude you're going to be okay he would try to tell me that and but I'm also spinning out because I'm only there for a couple hours and I go out and my world is very chaotic I'm living so the normal part of your the normal part of world is shrinking very shrinking very quickly okay and so I'm the self harm starts getting really bad like deeper deeper cuts and I can't stay at Mike's house because his parents won't let me they're they're I'm too filthy and I'm burning out the rest of the friendship and then that disaster groupy friends house ends in one incident where I'm having a big party there's like 20 kids there and all these kids from the school and there's even a band from one of the kids at the house at that house we had the big big party and then right in the middle of it there like 13 kids tripping acid the parents arrive so part's over all the kids have to go home all the other kids get to go home I get to go sleep in the field by Ina Bonita because that's the one last Refuge the spot where if I could didn't have anywhere else to be if I couldn't go to Mike's house behind kasab Bonita which is a big Mexican restaurant in Denver that if you ever watch the show South Park did that whole episode on kasab Bonita it's a big and that episode's actually accurate it's got pink restaurant with its cliff divers it's really weird but behind there there was a field and in the field there was a little dip so if you laid in you couldn't see it from the street so I was kind of invisible little camping area and so that was one of the last places that I could be and so I they about to go home I got to go there and so when that happened that really sent me off on a really dark spin where that was kind of like my last support that I had been staying at cuz I couldn't go home cuz the violence at home was really bad at that time like they were they were in the midst of a crack binge for months they were really really bad so I couldn't go home at all for more than an hour right and so I'm now homeless and yeah right and you don't have mic I don't have m point either no and by this point instead of sleeping in his house the only place I can go he lets me sneak into his Tool Shed M because in his Tool Shed behind his house they were they had a big recliner chair they had in storage like a big Lazy Boy and so I would go in there and if I didn't have anywhere else to be I could go to his toolshed and I could sleep because do you still know Mike he's still my best friend I just talked to him yesterday oh wow still my best friend in this world well thank God for these small mercies let me ask you this question are you a peace with the Mindless screen time you spend on your phone every day are you gaining that higher quality of life you know you desire if this sounds familiar I have good news starting on January 1st tens of thousands of men all over the world will start 2024 with a 90-day journey together in search of a more purposeful life it's called Exodus 90 and it was built to help men enjoy the freedom of becoming who they were truly made to be Exodus 90 guides you in removing the attachments that are holding you back from a better life and it actually works independent research shows that Exodus 90 men report considerable shifts after the 90 days a dramatic decrease in time spent on their phon stronger satisfaction rates in their marriages a more meaningful relationship with God and true brotherhoods of men on the same path for the past 8 years Exodus 90 has helped more than 100,000 men build their own road map for living with virtue in a culture that offers far too many paths to self-destruction so is it time for your Exodus we start January 1st find resources to prepare for Exodus 90 at Exodus 90.com Jordan that's Exodus 90.com Jordan to start your journey um so I'm in his shed and now I'm cutting myself so bad that there's a pool of blood on the ground beneath me and it's like 2:00 in the morning and I look up and there's the the the roof in the shed has gaps in it where you see the stars in between and so looking up and thinking I I got to do something I'm gonna die if I don't get some help I'm gonna die and so over the years Social Services had tried to intervene a couple times so I think well what I'll call social services on myself and so the when Dawn you're how old I'm 15 15 so when Dawn came I go and this is late 15 early 16 so this is the end of the that year beginning of the next year my birthday is in May so it's about a that this whole process takes almost a year for this process thing okay so the um I I think I got to get myself some help so at the next day when Don came I knocked on Mike's back door and borrowed a bus fair and phone uh um a phone book from his mom and called social services and set an appointment for that afternoon and so they brought me there and it was Dawn when I called the appointment wasn't until 3: or 4 in the afternoon by the time I got there they brought my mom in too so oh yeah we sit around at a table big counseling table and there's on one side there's four or five counselors on the other side there's me and my mom they have all sitting together and the counselor says so what are we here for what's your problem and so I produce a bloody razor blade it's box cutter style razor blade so I throw it on the table I said that's my problem I lift up my arm I show him the cuts I say I feel like I'm worthless feeling him at the bottom I feel like there's nothing left my mom who was the most practiced liar I've ever known got them to believe I was just making it all up I was just doing it for attention I just did it to get a rise out of people it wasn't that important and they sent me home with her and so we get three blocks from the place and she turns to me with this evil look on her face and snarls you should do it next you should do a better job next time I buy you the razor blades and I'm like okay you think I'm a monster I'll show you what a monster is now and instead of wearing that Darkness like a blanket I dove right into it I just I went on what I call a a 9-month period what I call scorched Earth where that was where I hit my full toxicity I was consciously going to anybody that was nice or good or positive in my world and offending you on purpose if there was something that you liked I would find that and break that if you like something I would steal it if you if whatever would offend you the most I'd do that and it was to the most important people in my world I even went to Mike's house I stole three of the big boxes of comic books went sold them in a comic shop I was trying to break every bit of positive in my world for nine solid months I did that and then at the end of during that period I also snuck and Charmed my way into every family member I could and like smoothed my way in and got into all their picture albums got a photo albums gathered every picture of me into a pile and burned them so currently there's only like five pictures of me that exist before the age of 15 because my my um so you you went and established good relationships just briefly specifically to get the pictures because I wanted to erase my past I wanted to annihilate my history um I was trying to erase me and so after 9 months of that do you think that what you were doing look the story that you've told so far makes why you did what you were doing even in this situation understandable did you know it was wrong at that time oh yeah you knew it was wrong well why do you think it was wrong given that you had all the reasons that you've described to do it why is it because I was hurting myself but at the time I I I was in in that self-destructive mode I would the Mike for instance as as an example when I did that Mike's like dude what the hell are you doing like I'm now you're doing your what has been done unjustly to you yes so you're actually participating now you're participating parti torturing you yes now I'm fully given into it and I'm going to do all the self-destruction myself I'm I'm going to go all the way with it the the that I I think I was told I was worthless and a monster enough and I told myself enough that I fully believed it and now I'm going to make everybody agree with me and I went to try to offend everybody right right and so after nine months of that I have of personal societal destruction I was alone completely alone and I had been alone for over a month and I was in that field behind Cabanita and I've been living there for about a month and I hadn't taken how you eating I was stealing free samples from the grocery store at the top of the hill did you did you ever engage in any criminal activity during that time apart from that yeah I would I would I would go I would walk up to the comic shop and steal a whole Shelf full of comic books walk down the street and hand them to the first kid I saw during that period what about what about what about criminal Behavior minor shoplifting I would go to the storees steal candy bars stuff like that nothing major just minor shoplifting okay but during that parent I was doing it like like egregiously and and blatantly of self-destruction yeah I would go to the grocery store steal an entire shelf for the comic books and the first kid that I would see walking down the street I just hand him to him he you want some Comics MH and because that it didn't matter to me and they so yeah I was that that kind of crime okay so now you're out in the field you're completely alone cuz you cut yourself off from everyone and I wake up in the snow and I because I had been there for months I hadn't taken my shoes off in weeks but I also wasn't wearing socks my feet were just rotting off of my body I like I said I was surviving by eating free samples from the grocery store and stealing whatever food I can from up there and going dumster diving I was trying to evade the police during school hours by being on school campus but not going to class I would because I had to be otherwise You' get arrested for treny so I'm I'm evading the police I'm and then I wake up in the snow and it's so cold the two block walk to get up to the grocery store I wasn't just shaking I was seizing I was like could barely breathe like my body was could barely move and I get up there and I'm looking in the mirror and I'm trying to wash my face off and I'm like I've got to do something something I'm going to die if I don't do something now I'm going to die and so across the street from the school I was at there was a building that why didn't you just want to die I don't know I don't know okay across the street from the school that I was nominally at was a building this said mental health and I didn't know what it was for I just knew that the sign said mental health I didn't I but I knew the last time I warned them they brought my mom and I'm not doing that  again so I'm just going to go in cold and so I went to the place and that afternoon and they had me meet a young lady she was it was a Counseling Center they had me meet a young lady that she was in her early 20s I think and I don't really remember much about that conversation cuz all I remember is the very end where she said I'm sorry there's nothing I can do I can't help you and I walked out of that door and I remember vividly standing on that porch and it was early early night so like that evening hour why had you not gone for any well I guess you said why you when you did try to go to Social Services and always worked out badly for you and then they brought your mom in and that went even worse and now you went to this mental health place and so when I stepped out that door my brain broke like a mirror like standing on that step that's the spot right then and there that my brain snapped like a mirror and felt like shards of glass in my brain and instantly three things happened like one right after the other one first thing was I found what was at the bottom of that tsunami like I that tsunami of pain I was living in went all the way down to the bottom and at the bottom there's no more waves it gets really quiet it gets really still and all the waves go away because there's nothing left to lose M like what you going to do cut my arm off I'm die going put me in jail they're going to feed me I don't have any more down from here and so right then the plans that I wanted to do crystallized in my head I had talked them through with those disaster groupy friends because when we were sitting with those disaster groupy friends instead of talking about sports or girls or football we talk about killing people we talk about so if you're going to shoot 10 people how would you do it if you're going to shoot up a school what would you do and that was the fiction of the group and so over the years I had already based on why why did why did that now you said you were at the center of that so is that were they showboating were they bragging it was a lot of it was showboating and bragging and it started off is just like like a m like we're looking at MK murder things and and crazy videos and stuff and and you're toying with the dark side yeah yeah and and I always would go further into that dark than anybody else would so when they were when they were looking up so that's a status issue as well yeah kind of and so it turn and that's how that that's initially how those started it was kind of like status kind of dark yeah yeah but for me then it was plans I knew I had talked it through I had already knew what I was going to do I was going to go either through the door the um Windows into the food court the the this was open campus area this at the school supposed to be attending at the school I was supposed to be attending North High in Denver and there was this was open campus era so they didn't lock the doors or nothing so you could get in and out easily could leave the campus and go to lunch and then come back so I knew if I went in I could go in through the doors and go right into the food court and kill everybody in the food court and what were how are you going to do that well so the two let me that portion of it so the two the two plans was either either the food court there or the Mall food court and it both both the same things neither one of those spots were soft targets the school had uniformed our police officers station in at all times and the mall had a police station a couple hour down from the food court the plan was to cause as much damage as possible and die while doing it yeah and but that wasn't really the goal of my attack the goal of my attack was to cause my parents to deal with making me I wanted to have them deal with the ramifications of creating me so I wanted to cause as much damage as possible as visibly as possible diew doing it so then they had to deal with creating a monster you think that would have made any difference I don't I don't know but that was the goal at the time I I I that that was what was in my head at the time and and so and I knew it a form of Revenge yeah but I didn't but but I felt that attacking them would have been useless that what they're going to hurt for one day and that's going to be nothing they've never faced accountability for anything they've ever done and they did me so now they have to face up with making me and that was that was the goal of that and I knew what to I knew where to get a gun because this was boys in the hood ERA this was late 90s so the gang bangers were all over and they would bring guns into school and Flash them in in the school because it was before the age of metal detectors so they would just flash handguns and they bought and sold drugs for my family so they knew me they knew they knew I was living in the field they they would regularly Buy drugs from my family and so I went up to him like Hey can you get me a gun hopefully one that shoots a lot of bullets yeah sure get me an ounce of weed and that these days that's walking down to a a store and getting it back then that's like 300 bucks worth of ballistic narcotics but for me that was easy they knew my parents were drug dealers I just went to my family's house stole it out of a druggies pant sleeping on my brother's bedroom floor like he had three ounces in his pocket I just took one out of his pocket took it and so did you get a gun I did I didn't get a gun I I went and gave him the weed I was set to get the gun he told me 3 days with in 3 days time I was going to have the gun and in that 3-day time that's when I was set the incident I got the gun I was going to cause the attack if it was daytime go to the school night time go to the mall that was the only how detailed had your plans been I knew exactly what door I was going to go into and what I was going to do and where how much time do you suppose you spent setting up those plans oh so that's a that's a two-sided question the plan itself crystallized instantly but I had sent months planning that because we talked about it how much time do you suppose you spent with your guys oh oh weeks and weeks that so how many hours at least 30 or 40 okay okay yeah lot long times of PL of just of just that dark conversation of planning it that's fantasizing and planning and in that you're working through the and and I I didn't realize it then I don't think they realize it then but we were working through the ins and outs and the the problems with it and what's going to work and what's not going to work and so yeah by the time it all happened I had the plan and it came out well that's that's the danger of practicing something yeah and so I I knew right then and so in that three-day time I didn't think about it then but looking back I think I was saying goodbye okay because I I didn't know that was what I was doing then but I was going to people in a much more peaceful way and like saying thank you and went to my ex-girlfriend and said thank you for letting me sleep on the gravel outside your window and I was going just saying sorry for things and I was I think I was saying goodbye mhm and at the end of that I went to Mike's house and when I went to Mike's house I knocked on his door and he opened it and I was in tears and I was just crying and he brought me in and he never asked what I was there for he never asked what it was about he knew intimately the hell I had been living in it was his bedroom that I was in there when I was with the cuts on my arms and he saw the pain from my family he knew intimately the hell I was in but he didn't ask he just brought me in and sat me down and kept on telling me over and over again you're a good kid in a  world that's what he kept on saying to me and he sat me down and he gave me some food and we watched a movie and he acted like that nine months of Destruction never happened and it wasn't hanging out with a friend that saved my life that wasn't what did it it was that when I knocked on his door I felt like I was a walking ball of nothing I was just there to close off my life and write the last line and say thank you goodbye I'm done turn the lights off I'm out and so I thought that I was just a nothing waiting to explode and what he did I think was he put the tiny granular bits of being a person back on the bottom shelf of my life like it was why was he able to do that do you think what is it about Mike he if you asked him what he did he just said he just did what a friend supposed to do yeah but he was the only person that you found who did that for you and and I I don't know what it is but he's the only one that no matter what happened he never treat me like I was anything but an equal he never looked at me like I was broken he never looked at me like I was a project he looked at me like I was a kid in pain and so he would talk to me about it and he would we would he we would he never looked down on me we would have deep discussions he was going to high school for philosophy and going to college and all this stuff yeah I was a Dropout and I was living in this crime infested hell hole and he never once acted like I wasn't anything but a buddy that deserved respect to talk to the holidays are rapidly approaching but we can find peace and calm

going to tie into the next part of the story so the so what I not what he did with that it wasn't just that I could like have a meal it was that I can enjoy food now MH like I can be reminded of the base human things and for me it was absolutely cathartic it was like like rolling the clock back on my Humanity like so you you had abandoned any sense of value in totally I he was uning to let that go unwilling unwilling to let it go and and not even unwilling to let it go it was that he didn't even see that it was leaving MH it was like like that's a weird dynamic it wasn't that he didn't let me slide off the cliff so he didn't even see that I was on a cliff like or didn't even treat me like I was on a cliff and that was extremely powerful to be seen when you feel fundamentally invisible like I would walk around and ask my classmates do you remember me when I leave the room but I'm gone do you remember that I was here cuz I thought and you'd just been ignored by the mental health clinic too yeah I felt completely invisible I felt alone and and nothing and to be seen and validated in in the most normal ways just like like it was just a regular Tuesday MH and to me I was on the precipice of a life altering Madness and it was just a Tuesday and it it fundamentally changed my life and I didn't leave his house for a week and everyone went and got the gun and now was Mike still living with his parents so why were you allowed to stay there I think he went and talked to him I don't know why okay I did never ask him I did I never even saw his parents that week uhhuh I I I just went and basically stayed in his bedroom I think he just went and talked to him I I I think he just was like hey Aaron really needs this and so yeah he's staying in my bedroom so I can get in trouble for it if you want to but he's there cuz by by that point that's kind of the attitude that he had he had had it with his with his friends group he went to art school and so he had a bunch of art friends and so they were really preppy and yepy and so well to do and not all of them looked not all of them were very uh um as charitable as Mike was to someone like me and so there were friend groups where they were like well Aaron needs to go he smells and Mike would stand up in the middle of him like no dude if you're saying needs to go you go ahead and bounce right now cuz he's not going anywhere and so that kind of validation and belonging it was it fundamentally changed me to my core and but and during that week during that week it it it changed me well that's the start it's it's it's important to note that it's not like it's a magic light switch it's not like ding everything's better and it's all fixed this was a process and this was the start of the process so what he did was give me a frame shift he let me change my perspective a bit it it the clock rolled back I my it was like I said instead of washing that tsunami and going through crazy and slashing around could set my feet down for the first time so he reminded you that you weren't rot to that I wasn't rot to my core and so I could be for a little while and so that and he also talked to one of his friends and let me stay with one of his friends for a while so was able to get a house a sleeping Arrangement and reassess and shift my frame of reference just a bit enough to take a breath right right and reestablish with my personhood but the chaos at home was still the same the abuse at home was still the same the violence all there was still the same the self-hatred was still the same that hell was still there but I was able to step back off that edge and take a breath but now we're going to fast forward three years okay cuz that was between 15 and 16 now to go to the night of my 19th birthday okay night of my 19th birthday I was planning on committing suicide I the Depression had so now you dropped you dropped the school shooting dropped the school shooting dropped the school shooting it had went it had went from outward anger to because almost instantly when Mike did that I felt ashamed and remorseful almost instantly when when when that reestablishment of my Humanity hit the the remorse and the shame of what I had planned was so that's so interesting one of the things that you're claiming is that you would have only been able to go through with what you had planned if you had in fact successfully severed every tie you had right you would have had to have been genuinely alone and alienated and Mike reminded you that you weren't so I I thought that I was right yeah yeah but Mike reminded me that I wasn't with that right and sort of despite your best efforts right cuz you'd spent you said eight months trying to alienate mons yeah yeah but despite all my best efforts and despite massive effort on my part that he he just wouldn't let go and that's love very much so here's here's a great example of that love that's why I like telling this part of the story so n my 19th birthday I was planning on committing suicide and I was going to do it by overdose I had gotten a bunch of LSD off the streets stolen a bunch of pills from cocaine from my mom I had copious amounts of drugs way more than we're going to need to do the job and because my depression had spun up and I was but I was inward I was I wasn't outward aggress anymore it was just I was ashamed and depressed I just wanted to end it tired dealing with this anymore but I had interventions in the past Mike K be like dude you're depressed we need to stop it I didn't want any of that so I was trying to act as normal as possible trying to act like they nothing was wrong in my day so I went to Mike's house and Mike's a very social guy he has a Social Circle of his own and one of this group friends is a girl named Amber okay and Amber was really friendly with me she was always really nice to me but she was his contact she was definitely his friend and but we would go over to her house every now and then watch a movie listen to music whatever and so he's like hey we're going to kick it at Amber today like great that's sounds like a great last day going to spend it with two of my favorite people and then go back to the field by costanita and end my life that was the plan and so I get there and that wasn't it at all I actually walked into a surprise birthday party for me and I walked into about 14 people saying happy happy birthday and Amber had baked a blueberry peach pie and I walked past him and dropped on my drugs in the toilet that was the last time I ever tried to kill myself and that's what really set me on my path and here's where the love portion comes in because when we left Mike's house there was no birthday party Mike called the head to Amber's house and said hey Amber I'm taking over there and this his birthday today and Amber was having a get together she had already had a bunch of people over she had already baked the pie and she's like hey Aaron's coming over and it's his birthday let's make it a birthday party for him so they all got together and made a bunch of decorations and stuff and threw up a quick birthday party I walked into a fundamentally life-changing thing that changed my opinion of myself to my core that my put friend put up in five minutes of being nice to another friend so yeah just a simple act of kindness nothing the the the people who tried to be not so simple not so man but but but real yeah and fundamental and genuine genuinely thoughtful genuinely thoughtful and that it it changed me that that's that's what really started me on the path to that was the time when I reassessed and right after that I I did some serious soul searching about is this me uhhuh or is this not me and had deep conversation with Mike and Amber and other friends about how no dude this isn't me this is I will live through hell and yeah I Mal adapted to it I made some really bad decisions and I made some really toxic choices but I don't have to stay there I can move out of this hell now and I can keep going and I can let them live their hell on that side well now you're old enough too cuz you're 19 at that point and at that point Mike actually Saved My Life One More Time by he moved me out to Kansas City the final clip that cut the family hooks out of me was he went to college in Kansas City and moved me out there for a summer I got to go live with him out in KC and I was I'm from Denver so got to go spend a summer out away from my family that did two things they gave me the confidence that I could do something on my own wouldn't get a job pay bills pay rent be stable it also pissed my family off when I got back how dare you leave how dare you think you're better than us how dare you how dare you have a life how dare you think you can exist without us and so that was where I was able to be like all right fine dude they're they're attacking me for making myself better yeah this isn't me yeah this is them yeah and so that's where I finally made that flip and right about that same time I started on the the real process of my recovery which I call acknowledgement so I was about 19 years old and I still again mom still has her hooks on me at the time I was working with her at a Veterans of forign Wars bar and so she um we it was right shortly after I had kind of started to Ser a contact and I'm in this process but I was working there so she was running the bar I was a bartender there and it was a Veterans of Foreign Wars bar so veterans go in there started drinking like morning I was 19 years old okay so and the uh my aunt aunt is on the other side of the bar and it's a bunch of people drinking whole bu busy night and she's on the other side of the bar and she's one of the people who had tried to molest me when I was younger dug through the carpet for crack rock tried to kill herself a couple times in front of me toxic toxic person and she's on the other side of the bar and she's just off handly talking I don't even hear the conversation they're having all I hear is are say Oh Aaron you know you love me and I stopped and said no I don't and I didn't mean to say that I it just came out I said no I don't and she said what I said no I don't actually love you tried to kill yourself in front of me you tried to molest me and I don't actually love you I'm done and she started screaming she blew up and had a big old screaming fit and to me it was like white noise I didn't hear any of it it turned into the static because it was like an anvil jumped off of my chest like instantly just instant release and I felt so good afterwards that I just walked out like oh my God I just I just did that uhuh and it it was Declaration Freedom yeah and so that started a process where I did that exact thing to everybody in my life that abused me I went in a process of acknowledgement and I'm I made sure it was purposeful very purposeful that it wasn't retaliatory I didn't go to anybody and say you did this and you need to pay for it I went to him and said this is our F our relationship has fundamentally changed I don't actually love you and I'm done and I walked away and that had such a cathartic effect on me how did you know that it shouldn't be retaliatory I just felt it in my core that it shouldn't be because I felt if it was retaliatory that just continues the argument it engages and continues the contest you're still hooked it's still hooked and it still continues to back and forth and it's still the toxicity we're going come back with well you did this I don't care maybe that's why you turn the other cheek yeah this isn't about retaliation this isn't about me getting something back cuz you hurt me you hurt me and I'm dealing with it right and I'm dealing with it by being done with it yeah I'm dealing with it I'm done with it and I'm going to walk away and I'm going to stop having that hurt and and what sort of response did you get from some of them screened and some of them yelled and some of them begged me to stay and I didn't care none of it mattered to me I just made sure that I said it why did you why do you think you were able to not be manipulated into feeling guilty I think because by that point I had burned out the ability to get embarrassed or ashamed about anything I had burned out the and I had burned out the ability for any of those family members judgment to hurt me anymore yeah well and as you said too You' be down in Kansas City and you had that break where you could take care of yourself and have a life and and that gave me a breath and and light on that to see it showing a bright light on that toxicity to see that that was its own sense of hell like it's it's their insults cause other people to insult them back cause a fight to happen it's just a violent Circle that just spins around and around and if I engage in that at all I get sucked into it yeah but looking at it it looks really stupid so the more I can step back and look at it the easier it got right right and so your life it was it was very important to me to to not have it be retaliatory and to make sure that it was just get it out of me and when every time I did it was like a step it was it was like flying it was like like Elation yeah just just pure Elation that I was able to do it and now today I can confidently say that I never sit and have the regret that oh my God I wish this person knew how I felt uhuh they all know they all know they all know I'm fine with telling them again so you started to get your life together fairly seriously at about 19 at about 19 that's when I started well kind of emotionally I started to get myself better and I started to reassess that I that I can do it get myself some stability and drop a lot of that toxic um affectation did you go back to Kansas City I did not I I actually came back to Colorado and and got but it living by myself and living and got my own apartment Mike was helping me and got my own job okay out of that family hook and what job did you get I was actually let's see right around then I was working at a Starbucks in Barnes & Noble downtown Denver so I was just working at a coffee shop service jobs and did you learn to do a good job yeah yeah I I've always been every job I go they always want me to be manager every every first job I ever had I became assistant manager you said that you didn't do your assignments and so forth at school so how did how was it that you were able to do a good job when you got a job the because when I when my the assignments I just never found them to be important for me I engage with things that I think are important so you felt it was important felt it was and important to do a good job and beneficial to do a good job this the assignments of the school I felt were wrote busy work the if I if I know the subject for instance English class the reason why I always went to English class was because the I had a teacher that I had gotten kicked out of the advanced placement English class for correcting the teacher on Shakespeare I he I I first day of class I corrected him on Shakespeare I had happened to be in my acid field parties with my dis friends we were acting out the plays of Shakespeare at night that's what we would do we had the complete works of Shakespeare we were got the midsummer night stream and just pick a character and go through the play that's what we would do trip and acid 16-year-old and so I went to school and my teacher was teaching Shakespeare first day and he was getting it wrong and it happened to me in summer Night's Dream and so I corrected him and the teacher does that thing you see in the TV like well Mr Stark would you like to get up and teach the class like yeah so I stood up and started holding court and so I started talking about it and he pulled me out of the class opened up the opened up the door class everybody could see still me in front of the class started berading me and screaming at me don't you ever contradict me like that how dare you confront me in front of class like that don't you ever do that get out of here kick me out of this class sent me down to remedial English so I got kicked out of the class where I'm correcting my Shakespeare go into the class where they're teaching sentence structure and punctuation and I'm like I go to the teacher I'm like you didn't find that particularly motivated no not really I went to the teacher I'm like hey can I I know this can I do this can I get your final because I know this stuff I do I I write and I read I'm really good at this like you can do that like please just let me prove it and so she did she gave me the final same teacher same te no different teacher oh different remedial English I see go down to remedial English her medal English teacher is a lady and she's like can you do it I'm like yeah sure so I take her final i ace the final for imal English got a 100% And so from then on I was her deao class assistant so even though I never went to class and even though I was only there once every 3 weeks when I was there I didn't have to do the assignments I could just walk around and help everybody else with their assignments and on book report day I I didn't have to read the book If I could walk up to her and explain what the book was if I go to her and tell her the story and tell her what happened to the book and explain that I know what it is I didn't have to write the report and so she was a real teacher she was a real teacher and she saw me as for being smart and so I would even though it was remedial English I went to that class every day all the every day I could every day I could get to that class I could go to that class cuz that was one little hour where I felt valued and and like I belonged right right yeah well part of the story that you were telling has that motive in it is that what you needed and unsurprisingly given the structure of your family and the fact that you were moving constantly and that you were generally friendless was a sense of genuine belonging and you had that to some degree with your with your group of of uh miscreant but it was based on something that was very bad at its core Mike you had a you had an actual relationship an actual relationship yeah and with Mike I valued it so much that I memorized his phone number and every time I moved out of state I had I had he was my home base yeah so I I like I every other attachment could disappear and but Mike was always right always there right okay so I I'm going to we got to close this up unfortunately because I'd like to find out you know what happened later in your life too cuz you you got married and you have kids and like you have a life and and yeah so we're gonna well we can fast forward to when I came out with my story well I want to ask you a specific question sure if if you don't mind well there's going to be people who are watching this and listening to it who are feeling both desperate and they probably have the reasons for it and who are feeling not only desperate but resentful and vengeful mhm right and who are toying with those sorts of dark ideas that you toyed with and so if you could say something to them other than everything that you've just said is there anything specific you would say that you know that would be helpful to someone who is tempted by that those darkest of motivations what I tell my own kids all the time is that the only thing constant in life is change that the only thing that's absolutely certain is that tomorrow's going to be different than today that it might not be better and it might not be worse but it is going to be different and so we can we have choices with that we can either resist that change and get worn down like the rocks on the beach and turn into sand and just get annihilated or we can adapt with those changes and move like the water itself and the more we can be that change and realize that the path that we are carrying and the damage and the destruction that we are that we have experienced is not us it's just luggage that we're carrying around with us it's just the baggage that we carry that the more we can maybe part of not accept that damning Judgment of yourself and others as find when when you when you tell yourself that you're worthless enough and that you hate yourself and everybody hurs you too that's your brain lying to you that's your brain lying to you you are in fact good enough you woke up good enough today and it's okay that you messed up and it's okay that you were wrong and it's okay that you got if your Future's okay and it's okay to be okay mhm it's okay to be good sometimes that's not a bad thing it's okay to feel well that's a weird thing to conclude if you have for example bargained to accept a very low social status because you've already in some ways made a contract with yourself that you're going to be an outsider you're going to be unpopular and that you are worthless and one and one thing that happens when you internalize that so much is that it gets to be repellent to any positivity like like someone were to come up and say oh you're really a good person well you don't really know me then if you see me then you'd see the Monster cuz I'm not really a good person yeah well it also violates the contract it does it does because we've established now that I'm the loow p and and the only way that I've seen for for an outside source to be able to combat that is with consistency and the only way I've by by being the one that doesn't break when the waves crash against you to to not to be a mic to not to not give up when the stuff gets hard but when when you're in that dark to realize that just keep going so why do you think liked you so much because I was smart because he he always says it it was because of the deep conversations because he could could sit and talk for hours and never be bored we can sit valued that in you really valued that in me and and that I was always that I would give everything of myself for my friends even from back then like if I had it I didn't value my stuff so if I had something you needed it I'm fine with giving it to you and I would give Mike the shirt off my back I tell him today dude I'd give you the skin off my back if you ever have a need so you were also a friend to Mike yeah and and and it was intellectual respect like the meeting meeting of peers mhm mhm yeah all right well I'm going to close this up I think that's a very good place to end thank you for walking us through that one of the things I did notice from a clinical perspective by the way is that you showed very little emotion negative emotion when you were describing what happened to you in your past and there's there's two possible explanations for that when you see it and one is that a person has hurt so bad that the emotion has just they're just flat but the other possibility is that the events have been put in their proper place and stripped of their emotional significance and transcend it so that they're no longer relevant and that looks to me like what you've managed and congratulations on that because thank you very much given what you went through that's a ma major moral achievement and the fact that you were able to deal with that and to stop it from being transmitted to your children is a that's work of incalculable significance yeah today my kids have all gone to the same Middle School atary school and high school they've all gone they they've never been evicted they've never had their mom beating their dad and their dad beating their mom none of that I say I use what happened to me growing up as exact examples of how to parent my children I just isn't it interesting you know that and this is a real mystery about human beings too is that like really in some fundamental sense all you had were bad examples now it's not exactly true because you had your brother and had Mike and you had some friendships and so you could see how reasonable and positive Human Relationships were were were uh structured but anyone listening to the story that you relay would say well you have every reason to not know how to be a good husband and a good father and yet despite all that and despite the determinism of a multigenerational family of pathology on both sides you were able to step away from it and establish something positive in the confines of your own life and I do it specifically by using what happened to me as a kid like exact examples of the parenting that I went through and just do the opposite right right well well it's so interesting because like if you're bullied there are two things you can learn from that or at least two things one is how to bully and the other is that you should never bully right and it's the same lesson there's something about the manner in which the lesson is received that determines the consequences it's not a deterministic course in that like well we do know that most people and this is actually the truth almost all people who abuse as adults were abused as children but most people who were abused as children don't abuse as adults y right right right so and and that I so now I I think that I won because today my kids are happy and healthy and H and and friendly and yeah that's a deal my 12-year-old when there's a new kid in her class the teacher puts the new kid next to her because she's the class Ambassador so she's she's the welcomer for the class right so yeah you said that I I don't get aemotion with that that's a good one that's a good way to end man well congratulations on that sir thank you sir that's a major accomplishment and say hi to your 12-year-old thank you I will you bet you bet all right everyone thank
