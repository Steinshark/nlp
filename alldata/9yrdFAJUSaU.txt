- Thank you Apex legends
for sponsoring this video. As you guys know, we did
a battle royale event sponsored by Apex Legends. And that was a lot of fun. And when talking with
the marketing guy at EA, he just wanted to do more stuff with us. So we decided to go to Shroud's house because he's the biggest
Apex Legends streamer. And obviously they're the
sponsor of this video, and every kill he gets, Apex Legends will donate money
to a charity of our choice. So we just got to his house. We don't, wanna film the outside 'cause we don't wanna give away anything. Currently he's streaming
and he's in a game. But when this game ends,
we're gonna barge in. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - So I kind of have to use the bathroom. So while we're waiting on him, I'm gonna donate and ask
him where his bathroom is. I hope it goes through
before the game ends. - Oh, he just won. - Oh really?
- Yeah. - Hey, what's up, man?
- No! - Oh, you made it?
- Yeah. - What's up man? - I just donated asking
where your bathroom was. I think you missed it. - in the flesh. How's it going?
- Great. So basically Apex Legends hit us up and wanted us to do a video with Shroud, where we just donate money to charity. So we're gonna play like a few games and every time he gets a kill, we're gonna donate a few
thousand dollars to charity, to put a little pressure on you. And by we, I mean, Apex Legends. - You wanna jump in right in right now? - Yeah.
- Or after this one? - No, this one right here. We'll see how you do,
we'll do 2,000 per kill. It's all Apex's money. So it doesn't matter to me.
- Okay. 2,000 per kill. - Yep, go off. Do you have any charity or is there anything that
matters a lot to you? - I'm not very good
with specific charities. - Yeah. - But I would definitely like
to see some go to veterans. - Okay. - So 2,000 per kill?
- 2,000 per kill. We'll see how it goes. - Got one. - No.
- No. - Tyler, this is for veterans, please. - Come on, you can do this, Tyler. - Yes. - No.
- I can do another one. - We'll do 2,000.
- All right. Well, let's do another one, then. - Yeah. - You wanna make it 5,000 per kill, now? - Yeah, sure.
- 5,000 per kill? - Yeah.
- Yeah, now he's gonna go off. - Doesn't matter how many kills you get. Every kill's five grand donated. - You wanna still do veterans?
- Yes. - All right, let's give that a try. - And I'm praying. I think
we could get three kills. - Three?
- Three. I think we do three. All right, Tyler. I need to drop 20, a hundred grand. - Apex just walks in. They're like, "All right, cut it off, a hundred grand too much." - Am I in right now? Or canceled? Canceled. You know, what's weird
about a live audience? Its way more pressure than like thousands of thousands of people
watching you online. - I know exactly what you mean. When we film some stuff in front of. - I got one, where's the other one? Down, nice. - Bro chill. Yeah. Three baby. - All right you're at 15.
- 15,000 - Chandler don't let him do too good. - I gotta question. - If you guys have Amazon prime, you should use it on Shroud. - Amazon prime, Twitch prime? Shroud is on Twitch prime? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Go use it on Shroud right now. If you're watching. - We'll count that. It's like watching like .

- Oh boy. - Sorry Apex. Oh my goodness. - Last one?
- Yeah I think we're good. - Okay. - Oh.
- Oh nice. - Oh no.
- What is this real? - Did that really just just happened. - Apex was like, "nope,
no, no, no, no stop". They were like that's too much. - I was at 30 grand. - Yeah so I guess we'll do 30 grand. They kicked him out of the game. They were like, "we can't afford this". - Apex pulled the plug. Oh my god. That is... All right well, it is what it is. - Hey guys, it's future me. This is my mom. We just donated the $32,000 to the Wounded Warriors. Back to the video. You want me to do it? So you be my keyboard? - Yes.
- He's got his hurt arm. - You gotta be his keyboard.
- I love this. I need this for my broken elbow. - All right, let's do this. 'Cause how much should we do per kill? - It's gonna be hard. Let's do 10 grand per kill though. - 10 grand per kill?

F the the entire time. - Okay, okay. - Are you serious? - Come on, man. We have to keep going. Okay let's try it again. What is happening? So there's like a bug that you can abuse and you can kick people outta games. - Oh really? - So I think someone is trolling us and kicking us outta games. - That's messed up.
