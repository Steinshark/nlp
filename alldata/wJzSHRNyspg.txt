ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guest the ELO in this series I take my subscriber games live on stream I analyze them and I predict what their chess.com rating is but in this episode I'm going to attempt to do something that I don't think has ever been done before this guest the ELO episode will not be recorded live this guest the ELO episode will not have five games but rather three and we will go into much greater detail and potentially make even some educational content but all of that aside none of that matters the most important thing about this video is I am playing guest the ELO against an AI I'm playing guest the ELO against chat gp4 because apparently chat gp4 can be given chess moves analyze them write explanations about them and potentially we don't know yet estimate the playing strength of the players this is crazy this is really Innovative stuff and I might be looking at the thing that's going to put me out of a job but guess what chat gbt can't scream the rook and chat GPT does not have a receding hairline an iconic receding hairline I may add so let's jump into today's guest the ELO versus Chad GPT 4 also a quick shout out from our sponsor for this video which is me I'm the sponsor of today's video uh all my courses on Chesley are 40% off the entire holiday season so go take advantage of that if you'd like uh also we have gifting now of available on Chesley so you can gift yourself a course or if you know somebody who wants a course for the holiday season you could give it for them uh my friends let's jump into it this is guest the ELO versus Chad gp4 and this is game number one now just so you know what it looks like by the way not to spoil anything but this is basically what it looks like it says can you analyze a chess game and estimate the ELO of two chess players on chess.com rapid and it says I can analyze a chess game and provide and estimate however it's important to note that my analysis and ELO estimate will be based on the specific game you provide blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so it's giving me like a politically you know it's giving me a political answer but here we go uh we're going to analyze a couple of games couple of positional games couple of solid games and then one completely insane game after uh which was a king's Gambit uh and that was weird I don't know what that lag was but it was a king's Gambit like Vienna thing so we're going to see how good Chad GPT can analyze positional chest and how good chant GPT can analyze uh you know insane tactical chess as well uh I'm I'm I'm very much looking forward to seeing how it does okay uh without further Ado E4 this first game black wait a minute these two don't even have names uh White is random Noob and black is Gotham sub that's weird I don't know why they were nameless okay we have a caroan defense Advan black plays Bishop F5 I personally Al prefer C5 just undermining the center this is the most popular move at at all the highest levels we're going to see first where we leave the opening and actually my friends we leave the opening on move four not because of this move but because of this move that's a bad decision um you want to take that bishop and then play E6 and the game is actually quite easy for black because you get rid of your bad Bishop because if you look at the pawn structure this is normally the pawn structure after a French defense this is normally the pawn structure after a French defense and you have a bad Bishop but the way that white is playing it in this position you don't have the bad Bishop anymore which is why black will get a very easy game put the Knight on F5 not in one move but in two moves but in this game actually black Vol black damages their own Pawn structure which is just not good and white now has an advantage and then black attacks the center with another pawn and now White's Advantage is plus one so I'm definitely getting like already maybe 1,100 Vibes this is maybe even 900 Vibes just because the opening is already a bit of a disaster um you shouldn't be throwing so many pawns forward without getting any development especially if you're breaking apart your structure but you know white is developing and we'll see okay see now even you know Queen D4 is good I I think Queen D4 is much more human you know but white plays Knight D4 which is actually the best move Knight E7 now if I'm playing white here I'm just castling uh but Bishop G5 is also the top computer move so now white has an overwhelming lead in development white is also threatening to take the Knight take the pawn take that pawn the only way that this could get out of hand is uh if black if black gets counterplay and and and you see where that counterplay is coming the plus three here is if you play Knight F5 danger levels I can't take but if this Knight D6 is crushing forcing the king out and now a fork that's kind of tough to see Knight F5 instead we get this and now we get total chaos because white completely misses this and goes here and and now now it's craziness now it's pandemonium it's it's it's basically a lot of one move calculation the best move here for white is to be patient because you cannot take this if you're playing with white in this position you got to just be patient for a move just for a move because these pawns are really hard to protect and now you can just smash into the position with E6 and actually this Knight is not touchable because of Rook e one so if if ever your opponent's king is stuck in the center of the board and is multiple moves away from castling you want to make sure there are always Rook skewer opportunities this is less reliable because now white is under attack white finds Queen E2 but now uh there's a queen trade oh whoa whoa backwards knight move you know I'm just a good rule of thumb for beginners intermediate like 8 times out of 10 the best move is not going backwards eight times out of 10 the best move is not going backwards now black finds Knight A6 which is good which is giving me you know it's giving me the floor is 900 okay Bishop C5 castles very good Play Bishop D6 okay Rook E8 attacking the Knight very good Bishop B5 very solid well accept that actually I I mean well actually it's kind of hard to protect because of G6 Knight F6 so this is like you stopping one problem and creating another one so white does a pawn up now white do two pawns up because of Knight oh no oh no okay well yeah now now white is just cleanly up two Pawns in the end game now we got to get the Rook down here that's what we got we got to start simplifying a little bit good I would trade I would now create a getaway for my king and immediately activate my second Rook I don't like the one move nature yeah see white is wasting time I don't like that okay the the the estimate is getting lower and lower because white is just not moving The Rook that like what is where is White going and white is just allowing a fork now there's a fork which black spots very and that's it black is not even worse anymore is white ever going to move the Rook oh my God this is terrible endgame play okay that's not a good move see again highle players know you want to park the night and apply pressure you don't always need to give a check just cuz it's there because now what do you do now you're going to keep moving around right Rook A2 uhoh uhoh oh oh oh oh all right well that that ended pretty unceremoniously that was weird that was a very like up and down game um it was a carocon it was a very weird E6 I don't know why we didn't take and play E6 then black got basically a losing position completely lost position from the opening tough to spot but if White had castled if white castled before doing any damage here it would have been game over like because if you Castle black finding a here is almost impossible you know black would probably play Knight C6 lose this Pawn then go here and then lose the queen like like very likely continuation to the game but then you know then it sort of fizzled out black played good defense and then for some reason black lost two pawns like that was totally unnecessary and then this was very well done but for some reason white just literally made like nine night moves and that just gives me the sense of like 1100 has to be the ceiling because they just move the Knight around a bunch and then they had no sense of danger at all just no sense maybe it was low time but I you know I don't know so I'm getting like my ceiling here is $199 it's got to be $199 um let's see what Chad GPT says first I'm saying $199 um I guess we can see what chess.com says a you know as well but uh that that's what I'm saying I think if I had to guess I would say 1100 maybe like 1080 1080 to 1120 low 1100 low 1100 is my final answer um let's uh let's see what Chad GPT says so Chad GPT says the opening the game starts with car c White's uh Bishop takes F5 indicates a willingness to double the opponent's pawns correct correct uh sequence that shows good tactical awareness from both players what hold up taking on E2 taking on E2 is a sequ this sequence shows good tactical awareness by um I don't know about that endgame features multiple Pawn structure changes and maneuvering both players demonstrate an understanding of endgame principles nope nope winning tactic starts with rookie the winning tactic starts when white blunders Checkmate okay there's no major blunders except Checkmate in one and guess it says 4 1 1400 to 1600 this is a rough estimate based on no way there is no chance there's no chance they're 1400 they've got to be like 1100 or a, high 900 okay High 900 yeah I was giving them a little bit of credit but yeah that's I said 900 is the floor okay I I gave them a little bit too much credit I you know I that's what I thought they are uh 962 versus 968 yeah uh yeah chat GPT you are on some sort of 14400 I mean my God it was good a little bit you know it definitely let me help it out incorrect um the rapid ratings of the players oops I cannot type were 962 and 968 respectively let's see what it says thank you for the update chess ratings especially in Rapid formats can sometimes times be deceptive and a single game might not fully represent the typical performance of the player yeah shut up stop stop explaining it to me I'm explaining it to you you are a chat thing that operates on input all right this difference illustrates how complex and Nuance chess skill assessment somebody's got to hire CH gp4 to be a writer for like the president you know like when they got to do those speeches anyway let's look at game number two um I what does game review think uh I think my game review is going to run a little bit longer so uh you know I I'm for now I will take you back to this overlay and um let's see let's see what happens game number two we will we will let that we will let that one think for a little bit Gotham sub is with the white pieces in this game okay we have ready we have night after I mean already I want to say like 1400 but let's see what happens okay in English Queen's Gambit all right so we just have like a fullon queen Gambit decline traditional variation this is this is the semi slav when black plays the uh the triangle defense and what is going on here the computer thinks nothing it's not giving me an estimated ELO for some reason okay ch.com is bugging out I don't know what's happening great no problem Bishop G5 Bishop E7 Queen C1 is a we I don't know what that is that's I was that a mouse slip what was were they trying to go here cuz that's a very common move Queen C2 supports e okay we're about to find out if it was a mouse lip whoa uh no no no I mean you want to finish your development you don't there's no Reinventing the wheel here oh my goodness we're opening up the position okay couple of things right off the bat if you trade your dark squared Bishop you want to replace pawns on dark squares also if you trade the dark squ Bishop you or if you trade Bishops you don't want to open the position for the opponent the opponent is the one that wants the Bishops to open up the board and not to mention there's just a flaw here tactically because there's just Pawn takes Knight takes and Bishop takes Pawn I mean it just hangs a pawn in in one move so every time that you there's a trade happening you got to think what's opening up and what's closing but black plays Rook E8 which is not a good move now we have E5 good okay that's not a move that does much of anything and and here comes the queen so maybe white was a genius all along and I'm an idiot and I need to really you know focus on my chest oh wow that f8 F6 that is a really sophisticated idea that's not me being sarcastic this is really clever by black to reposition and create a pawn break that would that's that's four-digit type of stuff that is that is actually not bad at all wow and now white is like I don't want to take and get attacked so white slides back that's I got to I got to respect this type of play this is either the luckiest 800 of all time or this is actually intermediate stuff paon takes now I would take with the pawn I would take with the pawn because it restricts Black's pieces it also opens up the D file with pressure and it also opens up the D4 Square for my knight so white took with the Knight which is you know white is not 2,000 but in this case yeah like the side with more space and right now that is white white definitely has a little bit more space than black the side with more space wants to avoid peace trades and you want to trade in a way that is restricting Knight takes is not restricting this Knight is better than this Knight and so you you want to you want to restrict those pieces and now you want to take with the pawn still so we take with the queen okay very good now black is just better black is better because the queen on her own is not actually attacking anybody that's the thing about the queen she's really powerful against the weakened position or she needs backup she she can act solo against the weakened position but now she's got to get out now she's got to protect the pawn good but now black can take and attack that the best move is C5 I don't think black is going to do that all right this kind of hesitancy with the Rook bringing me back to maybe 11 1200 yeah F4 is a very logical move the computer hates it because of C5 but no chance black plays that B3 and now again black is crushing if they strike at that I don't know if they uhoh uhoh uhoh uh oh clutch move by white very clutch well spotted very well spotted and in a shocking turn of events this Pawn is actually pissed so black was better if black played C5 because after takes there is this powerful move d4 which wins material but the way black does it actually black is stuck and now black doesn't have any advantage because Black's totally stuck here all these pawns are bad white can even play Knight E4 Knight C5 and take advantage I don't know why that's such a bad move according to the computer I guess you just want the pawn Rook C8 Bishop okay that's logical now I think black is going to go Queen D6 I'm a a genius F5 that move kind of makes sense but I don't really know what the idea is after Pawn takes cuz now you lose the pawn on D4 yep well spotted can't take the Knight though Rook C7 all right yeah now white is getting a lot of pieces into the attack ooh oh Rook takes bishop and if takes there's a queen sacrifice oh and if take take take this is mate so actually Rook f8 is mate so take take Rook F7 is forced wait black resigned wait what is black doing why would black resign here black has two legal moves one is made and the other isn't oh that's crazy that's a lot of information wow that is a lot of information I mean that that is insane that is a life lesson right there I mean that is oh my oh my folks you can't resign if you have two legal moves I mean if one of them is m in one and the other's not you got to play the one that's not but I guess black was tilted incredible tactical spot by white wow okay I I'm I'm getting the sense this is like a 14400 level game because I think there was way too much control exhibited night takes is a you know I'm going to say like 1350 that's what I'm going to say cuz I think the opening was definitely weird and and there was one big mistake E4 was a big mistake but since then white showed a lot of restraint a lot of control and then some good decision making here and then I mean to spot that just but how much credit do I maybe it's more than 1350 because I feel like Rook D4 Queen E6 is a crazy spot I'm I mean that is that is beautiful and then resigning resigning rather than playing Rook F7 though oh man oh man that is that is stuff I'm G I might say like I'm going to say, 1500 1500 rapid you know I'm going to say 16600 final answer now what does chat GPT think first I'm going to uh put the game into chat GPT that is the first thing that I'm going to do um I'm going to put this game into chat GPT I'm going to say I'm I'm going to go to the overlay in a second please analyze this game please analyze this game and estimate the ELO of the players okay and now we are going to let's see I'm saying 1600 let's see based on the game begins with a solid classical opening showing familiarity with opening Theory sequence from take take take shows a mix of strategic ideas and tactical awareness exchange leading to Bishop B6 demonstrates the ability to capitalize on tactical opportunities convert an advantage oh oh I said 1500 I said 1500 I said 1600 sorry 15 oh my God oh my God me and Chad GPT are aligned I said 1600 final answer it thinks 1500 to 1700 because of the representative level of the play both players exhibit good understanding of opening principles middle games and strategy endgame transition conclusion show a higher level of tactical awareness yes yes few subtle inaccuracies yes just like taking oh my God that is nuts what 926 n 926 this was a rapid game oh I guess white spent oh my God I got to put this through a game review that is that is insane if that's actually 900 yo yo 900 but me me and Chad GPT both thought 1600 that is crazy and it was accurate and let's see what chess.com thinks the game review is going to take a second but that is crazy I feel like the I think I think game review is going to agree with us I mean what a what a tactic toward the end there oh it's loading it's loading it's loading it's going to take a second it's going to take a second and it's survey says oh oh this got to be broken are you kidding me they sacrifice a rook and get a brilliant no it's got to be broken there's no way there's no way that is nuts White had a they've sacrificed a a rook and a queen that's I don't I don't agree I like that me and Chad GPT thought the same thing though we both thought uh 1500 wow all right let's load the next game into Chad GPT uh please analyze the chess.com rapid ELO of these two players based on these moves and then I'm going to show you the game right now all right the last game that we have is chaos this was a game submitted uh and it was a Vienna it was E4 E5 it was Bishop C5 which is a system that's definitely a system and now white plays F4 which is kind of like a Vienna and like a king's Gambit is thing is what this is um but we're about to find out how good these guys are e takes okay now white can play Knight F3 stopping Queen H4 which is probably what I would play but D4 is much more aggressive and there we go and this is well spotted by black so we would know right away if black was 800 if black like moved the bishop because then white would get Bishop takes pawn and just have a massive Center and a huge lead in development and would be better Queen H4 the King has to go up it's not the end of the world actually now this I don't like I don't like black wasting time with Queen checks helping white develop this is the entire reason people play The King's Gambit is because it allows white to get this easy development with a lot of space especially if black doesn't know what they're doing and as you can tell from this opening black does not know what they're doing cuz White's King is totally safe white is going to go G4 Bishop G2 and do what's called castling by hand if you ever find yourself in a situation where you can slide your king behind your Rook it's okay to do that's called castling by hand D6 but now white rushes this move because this is completely the wrong decision because boom oh my goodness oh my goodness this is really really bad so white had one idea but then white totally misplayed it white rushed it that was not that was not very good now you can't take oh my oh no now there's this and then Bishop oh god oh no oh oh oh this is God this is I'm getting like 1,000 vimes who learn the Vienna but doesn't quite know how to defend themselves correctly and the I mean the worst skill any chess player has is defending but especially if you're like a thousand cuz this is just not good you got to stay patient here if anything play Rook G1 and then G4 but you also might just have to walk your king to safety you might need to bring the queen up bring the Rook walk the king over there you got to be patient and white was anything but patient walking directly into oh no you don't want to trade pieces cuz you're down two pawns you don't want to trade the bishop and the Queen and now you're trading everything I mean now now you're dead lost you're just down two pawns now if I'm playing Black here I go here I go here I choose a way to Castle and I defend my pawns perfect if I'm playing white that's very good I go here I play Knight D5 good now black should play Pawn to G6 now black should Castle Queen side oh my God black is playing all the moves I would play yeah now if I'm playing Black I'm just going for trades I'm just going to trade the pieces I don't hate that move I maybe I sto that like I I by the way I love this by white can I just say to create counterplay creating a little chaos a little bit of uncertainty near the black king you got to launch your pawns there's two ways to play a worse position sit and defend or attack now again if I'm playing Black I'll play A6 here but again don't hate this move at all if I'm playing white I'm probably I'm going back I don't want to trade not the worst not the worst but black is going to start firing away now yeah Knight F6 is great I would not take you got to play B6 yeah good move I I love what white is doing this is all very very smart and apparently now all of this indecision white can take advantage nice perfect Free Pawn oh my goodness black is now no longer up two pawns black is only up one pawn and now Black's King is in danger and this is a massive weakness it's a massive weakness which is why if you see your opponent trying to advance acknowledge them sometimes and just don't let them just play A6 don't let them have any fun and black needed to be faster black needed to not go backwards eight times out of 10 the best move is not going backwards this move is not going backwards it is developing and black hesitated played too passively and that was just losing and now this is mate okay that's also probably very good oh you well now what you do is you don't even take the Rook you take the pawn go back then take the rook and then Advance the pawn perfect perfect just take the Rook now or or oh oh my God that's just mate I mean I would have taken the Rook because now there's Rook D7 m one okay weird moment for black to not even spot that Checkmate I'm not even sure black is a thousand like I'm getting 900 Vibes because like I saw the whole game but you got to stop mating one I mean of course you made some mistakes um now there's a lot there's a little bit of information in this game right in the opening um Queen G4 is a huge amount of information huge because you're just giving a check with a piece that you just moved tunnel vision I just moved my queen I can move no we got to go back we don't we don't need to do that right and then right here by white definitely tunnel vision simply like that is the piece that was literally just opened up so you got to be careful and then immediate reaction like trading pieces is craziness but then this A4 move this is giving me like four this is the only reason I would guess about a th you know 1,00 to 1100 like I would say 1080 because white went on A4 feel like if white was low rated white would not have played A4 black played more like a 900 than white for sure um but I would say like 1070 would be my guess and then not spotting the mate at the end is is tough but let's let's see what Chad GPT thinks I ran the moves already it says the opening was the Vienna King E2 is highly unusual typically not recommended it's aggressive by black aims to exploit weaknesses middle game featured a couple of tactical exchanges both players seem to recognize they're also signs of strategic vulnerabilities okay end game shows a clear Advantage for white effective use of the rook in the night exactly exactly completely correct move i7 demonstrates good understanding of mating patterns higher level of tactical awareness compared to to earlier phases of the game in the end game okay um players are familiar with basic principles and tactics but may lack consistency or understanding okay estimated ELO of a thou wow me wow wow I said about 1080 1080 and Survey said what 16 60 and 1760 what nah come on guys what guys what how no oh God no no no guys at least me and chat GPT were aligned Two Times by the way I I I said the same thing wow this is interesting me and chat GPT being align twice and what does this thing get out of here this is just I mean come I mean that was interesting and I think as Chad gbt gets better it's it's going to probably be able to summarize things a little bit more um but that that's fascinating I hope you enjoyed today's episode it was a little bit more chill than normal but it was interesting to compare my guesses to Chad GPT um it was we were align the last two guesses I said, 1600 and 1070 1080 oh my God I can't I got to get that last game out I'm going to go for a walk get out of here actually don't get out of here take advantage of the holiday sale on Chesley then get out of here
