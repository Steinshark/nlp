all right so i thought that it would be fun to just start out with like a spicy hot take um uh because i i realize i i've realized lately i'm just not a controversial enough person these are more controversial things to be more controversial yeah yeah so uh what i wanna what i start out by saying is that gerard is wrong it's a great way to start to start the podcast so that's it that's the whole thing [Music] this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so hello everybody we are back here with richard roland for one more episode of uh of our universal history series and we are getting very close to holy week uh as the orthodox and so richard had a great idea of looking at the the the different services during holy week leaving leading up to uh to the the entombment of christ and how it also relates to the ritual that we talked about in terms of the mar the marriage between the king and the city and how this all comes together in the symbolism of holy week so i'm i don't even know what he's going to say so i'm as curious as anybody to find out so richard thanks for coming along again i'm glad to be here and i plan to say a lot of weird things that will get you comments on youtube that's right that's my plan that's great yeah um all right so i thought that it would be fun to just start out with like a spicy hot take um uh because i i realize i i've realized lately i'm just not a controversial enough person these are more controversial things to be more controversial yeah all the attention yeah yeah so uh what i wanna what i start out by saying is that gerard is wrong it's a great way to start to start the podcast so that's it that's the whole thing all right so for people who don't know what he's referring to so richard is referring to rene jira is an anthropologist who explored the theme of sacrifice and how sacrifice is all based ultimately on human sacrifice and that human sacrifice is the basis of unity in terms of civilization that that at least was at the outset the need to find a scapegoat to put all your to put all the evils of of a group into the scapegoat to kill the scapegoat and in a kind of moment of ecstasy and violence to refine to find the unity that that had been kind of falling apart as all our different idiosyncrasies started to manifest and it's all related to the notion of memetic desire which is the problem of everybody desiring the same things but there's also being a lack of resources or lack of possibility for everyone to have the things they desire and so by creating the scapegoat mechanism was a way to restart the process and to to avoid it going out of control and moving into like carnage and you know massive breakdown of society so why is he wrong richard so the reason he's wrong is very simply murder is not the basis of culture marriage is all right so um and and i i'm you know again that's a little bit of a spicy hot take but um for me gerard is very much like joseph somebody like joseph campbell who famously wrote the hero's journey which is like a certain way of understanding mythology but of course for campbell it's the only way to understand mythology and a lot of times what i find is when somebody really gets plugged into gerard or really plugged into campbell for the very first time then it's like they suddenly they have a hammer and everything looks like a nail and they try to explain all the stories that they encounter uh by means of that thing right so i don't know that i have to say i'm curious to see what you're gonna say because to me the theory that gerard brings about works very well with the idea that kane is the founder of of civilization and so that his like his founding of the city is is based on murder and you see that also in the roman founding as well and in other cultures but i would like i would think that it'd be something like murder moving towards marriage or something like that oh no that i would agree i would be okay with that i would all right yeah so actually i was going to start out by talking about the founding of rome all right which would be a great way to help us understand holy week um and uh you know yeah so let's get into it so um the way to to kind of to understand holy week you have to basically and and i'll preface this by saying this isn't just my arbitrary saying oh well holy week has something to do with marriage to the founding of a city because that's literally just the services that's the text of the the liturgy that's what the church puts before us so in the orthodox church in the east we begin the first four days of holy week in the evenings we celebrate a matin service which of course maddens is a morning service um but typically speaking in the orthodox church we have this uh let's say like a sense of urgency that that kind of kicks in once a big feast starts getting up uh starts approaching and everything gets bumped up a little so in paris practice in the evenings we celebrate something called the um something called the bridegroom mountains which is all about the tomb of christ as his bridal chamber right so this is not just like an arbitrary association that i'm making so to kind of understand what's going on here you have to know a little bit about how cities in the ancient world were founded and that is that cities were founded by mythical founders and i don't actually care if so if you if you do or do not believe that these mythical founders were actually people who existed for the purposes of the things i'm saying uh today that's not hugely important uh what's important is that people in the ancient world believe this and they embodied it in a ritual way and it is a universal pattern that is this is really a universal pattern that you see in most cultures they always trace back the lineage of the king all the way back all the way back and at some point the first person in the lineage is a demigod or some kind of mythological creature and this is something you see as in tribal cultures as much as you see in mesopotamia or in rome or whatever culture you're thinking of yeah you have you have uh you have a mythical founder this is a guy who who founded your city this guy has some connection to the gods and uh and basically you could say the goal of every king after him is to embody that founder right to make that founder present to the city again so um there's a a historian who wrote a ton of stuff about this um and he said uh he says um he he's looking at he was looking at greece and italy in this sort of the city-state period i know that typically speaking we think of like greece and we think of democracy we think of italy we think of the roman republic or the roman empire but there's a period before all of that when uh there were there weren't empires there were just these city-states and each city-state was ruled over by a king and uh he says that a well-known fact in the history of greece proves in a striking manner that in the beginning the kingly office belonged to the man who set up the hearth or the altar of the city so this is really important the basis for kingship in the ancient world is priesthood and if you kind of if you if you if for a lot of people especially if you're from an evangelical background you maybe you don't know a ton about kingship in the ancient world but and so most of your experience of what kingship in the ancient world means uh comes from reading the old testament right which is the which is the series of ancient texts which the most people have read right the thing about the thing about that though is that the kingship of ancient israel and judah was atypical in a lot of ways or at least the kingship of judah was atypical in a lot of ways the kingship of israel after the kingdoms were divided was actually super typical in a bunch of ways but the original basis of kingship was that the king was the priest he was the high priest of the people he was the one who was supposed to mediate between the people and the gods and we see we actually see one version of this in scripture which is melchizedek yeah and melchizedek is both a priest right and a king and you see that of course those powers get separated and for good reason in in in history uh but there is a sense in which those that kind of stand above right the highest versions of these have the two positions united in one figure and that's why that's why christ is the priest after the order of melchizedek right he rejoins these things actually we're going to talk a whole lot about things that sort of get split or divided right and then the thing to to know is christ unites these things in in himself right even these different mythographical patterns or or patterns uh that we're talking about even things like the hero's journey and gerard's scapegoat theory and these things like this uh those theories are incomplete in and of themselves because they don't explain everything um and they don't they don't fit you could say all the information that we have but then you can also see how you if you go to the story of christ you sh you you should find those in the story of christ like every every pattern that's a real pattern is in the story of christ okay so um so the king is the guy who sets up the hearth he's the one who sets up the fire um and here's a nice little bit of etymology which i think you'll enjoy jonathan he's the one who sets up the focus for the city where the latin word focus comes from comes from a really ancient indo-european root that has to do with a lot of our words for light like photon or photo or you know uh come from that same ancient indo-european root but the word focus in latin means the hearth yeah means like the family hearth or the temple the temple heart in other words uh the focus is an altar yeah and you can understand that at least in that circumstance it makes sense because the heart was actually a fire so you can imagine like in your house or in right in the space that is where most of the light would come from would be from the center so light would actually move out from the center into the the periphery of the of the space and so you it's really like a cosmic image to kind of un to understand it that way right and hearth hearts are also always alters in the ancient world this is the other thing people have to remember like your family hearth like the fireplace in your family that from which warmth comes and therefore life right in the cold european winter um that's also where your food is cooked all these different things that hearth is also an altar and you have your family gods there so if you read the aeneid which we've talked about before i think in our very first universal history video together um if you read the aeneid what's the whole thing that aeneas is trying to do he's trying to take the household gods from troy his household god's from troy he's trying to bring them to this new place that the gods have established for him which is going to be italy and of course uh aeneas found the city of alba longa um and it's from obalonga that uh eventually the founders of rome will come which we'll talk about here in just a second so the ritual crowning of a new king is basically you could say it's supposed to be a repeat of this first founding it's supposed to be a ritual marriage between the king and his city and this ritual marriage is handled differently in different cultures if you want some good examples of this uh you can just go study the life of alexander the great who we've also talked about he's a it's one of these really liminal figures a lot of connective tissue in the symbolic you know world or the universal history goes back to alexander and one of the things that alexander would do when he come whenever he came to a new city is he would do whatever you needed to do in that city to become the new founder of the city right to become the new uh the the son of the most high god of that particular city right so when he goes to thebes he does this ritual sacrifice to the apis pool um in a lot of places in the in the like ancient mesopotamia where there's a lot of fertility cults um to become the king of the city you actually ritually spend a night with the city like like that they take the marriage to the city to like a really kind of a literal level um and of course this is you know consummated usually with like a temple prostitute um everyone in alexander's story did they tell did they talk about that i don't think i don't think i don't think that comes up in alexander's story specifically but a lot of canaanite cities and like if you look at rituals for crowning like kings of babylon and things like that it's that's that that is very much there so yeah yeah so what i'm what i'm just trying to say is like there are a lot of different examples in alexander's story of how do you go somewhere and become to become the king of a city you also become the son of the gods and you also become kind of you ritually re-embody the founder uh of the city and this is something by the way caesar augustus who probably we should do just a video on him at some point if we're going to do course yeah because he's so important to universal history right uh another but this is something he's really conscious of and so this is you know part of why uh he commissions the indian right um this is part of why he's um but but also some other ways that we'll talk about in a moment he he really tries to consciously create this effect of being married to the city of rome yeah we also people don't realize that the emperor was pontifex like the emperor was also high priest in rome you have images of augustus you know wearing more military guard but you have images of augustus where he's actually wearing a priestly garment like his cloth over his head and we don't we don't we don't recognize but he's actually dressed as a priest yeah so in in a city like rome which is significantly less ancient than babylon for one thing um it's probably founded you know right around the time of maybe the prophet isaiah something like that um so you know pretty pretty recent as cities go um but uh it's ritual prostitution was never so much a thing in rome itself um um there are places in like classical the greco-roman world that did practice ritual prostitution but it wasn't so much a thing in the city of rome itself however um you could say you could say that's like a feature of like the ancient fertility cult and rome is like a little more man i don't want to say modern but it's like it's because that's not even like correct in any way but but it's like it's a little more recent it's a little more up to date right so what rome does have they don't have ritual prostitutes but what they do have is the vestal virgins right so the vestal virgins um are dedicated to the service of vesta vesta is one of the hearth gods yeah um that and in fact her her temple or her altar was sometimes called the trojan hearth right so she's one of the hearth gods that um sort of the hearth god that aeneas was trying to rescue from the ruins of troy and reestablish his civilization so think back to this idea in the ancient world that the founder of the city is the one the king is the one who establishes the city's hearth yeah right and of course you could say if the if the hearth like the literal fireplace in your home if that's your heart then that's your altar the city's hearth is the altar where everybody comes to yeah to worship so the vessel virgins are basically they're the the priestesses they're usually at one point there were two and then i think later there were like six uh but they're the ones who are uh given the specific task of tending the fires the hearth fires at the temple of vesta which are never supposed to be allowed to go out right and actually the the cult of esta is pretty much the last religion in pagan religion in rome to be abolished people held onto it i think a lot longer than they did basically any of the other gods after the conversion of christianity i think it's something because it was linked to the very existence of the city right yeah some people said well if the hearth fires ever go out then rome will fall right um uh so you you have uh you have these vestal virgins and the important thing to sort of know is that ria who's the she's she was a vestal virgin of alba longa she's the mother of romulus and remus so the story is is that she was you know obviously as a vessel virgin the the two important words there are vestal and virgin um and uh so if you're a vessel virgin and you suddenly become pregnant um they had all kinds of creative ways of killing you um actually and in genuinely creative ways because in ancient rome even if a vessel virgin defiled herself you were still not allowed to to like harm her in any way so they had to come up with these special rules for how would you bury a vestal virgin alive because then you're not harming her she's just stops she's gonna die underground yeah but side note um i i once wrote uh for school i once uh this is why you should homeschool it's because i once wrote a whole paper on methods of execution in the ancient world so i just the stuff is always jingling around yeah somewhere but but they would but uh so they had these two laws one is they couldn't normally they would execute somebody by strangling in ancient rome so they couldn't do that because she's a vessel virgin but they couldn't bury her alive because there were laws against burying someone alive within the precincts of the city of rome um and this is tied to a lot of other things that we probably don't have time to talk about today but um but typically speaking building when you were building a new building uh there was a there's an extremely ancient practice of like you bury a slave for its foundations and uh the romans didn't like that um and so they said well we can't bury somebody alive so what they did is they build an underground little house and they put like two or three days worth of food and water in there and then they put the ver the yeah they sealed it and so that so they weren't burying her alive and they didn't kill her she just died of starvation which is not a great way to go it's great yeah yeah yeah so uh romans everybody all right so maria yeah so rhea is the vessel virgin of of uh of alba laga she's raped by mars and so she has to run away uh she's raped by the god mars and she becomes pregnant people find out she's pregnant she used to run away or they'll kill her he'll kill her and then of course she goes out into the wilderness and has her children romulus and remus um and so the founder i just want to kind of point this out and i don't want to point this out in well there's no way for me to point this out with giving some people um but the founder of rome is both the son of a virgin sort of and also the son of a god yeah right although obviously he's not virginally born and there is also to give the gerard folks their due here there's also a murder of the son of a virgin and the son of a god that is a part of the founding myth of rome right um so for those who don't know i'm sure everybody knows who's watching this but romulus kills remus yeah in order to found the city yeah if you don't like what have you been why are you watching even our podcast if you don't know that yeah like what rock or vessel virgin uh entomb have you been living under um yeah if you don't know that so uh uh so new roman kings when a new roman king was made and the romans did have kings for a long time when a new roman king was made he'll be brought through the gate of the city up to the city's high place the capitoline hill and of course the highest point of ancient cities is always where they would put the temple right yeah um and the marriage would be consummated between the king and the city of rome the marriage would be consummated on the capitoline hill um and different again different cultures have different ways of doing this the way they would do it is they would they would seat the uh the king in a chair and then they would basically stand there and wait and there would be an auger there and they would wait for the gods to show by flashes of lightning or certain bird flight patterns various things like this um i'm not an auger so yeah just you know you can't read them yeah yeah and um the uh the marriage would be consummated when the gods gave their ascent in other words the gods are the gods are presiding over the marriage right they and and they give their ascent and then the marriage takes place and this this caused a kind of a a relationship where even though it was like a totally platonic or like totally celibate thing um where the king was sort of you could say ritually married to the vessel virgins right so the vessel virgins they embody and it they're really the vestal virgins are really un important to understanding how rome thinks of herself which is sort of as the well gosh darn it as sort of the unwedded bride right because because the vestal the whole thing uh uh with vet going on with vesta is that she's she's this virginal goddess but also somehow she's a mother right she's the mother who's never been violated that's how rome thought of herself right so she thought of herself as like a mother to the other cities and the lands that she conquers but also one who had never been wedded none no one who had never sort of been taken as a bride right never been conquered by never been conquered yeah exactly and um and so when the when the kings are driven out and abolished when the tarkins are driven out of rome what they do is they take all of these things that in every single ancient culture sort of naturally uh manifested in the king and they split those up and they break those things apart right and so one of those roles is of the high priest the pawn effects maximus but they still did a very similar ritual to this for instance whenever they would make a a new consul and a lot of roman historians talk about this when caesar augustus when he becomes what he becomes right what he basically does is to take all these little titles all these little manifestations of the city's authority and actually to bring them back together and kind of reunite them into a single person so one of the ways that he does this is that there was this law that the pontiff's maximus has to reside in a publicly owned house in other words if you're the high priest you have to live in a house that the city owns not your own the point is you're not supposed to be uh accumulating wealth and power to yourself right you're supposed to be just operating on behalf of the city and so what he does to kind of do an end run around this is that he keeps his pro his private house but he gives part of a way to the vestal virgins and creates a new shrine of vesta there in his house so some of the vestal virgins come to live in caesar's house symbolically right they're his wives yeah right so what is he doing he's sort of symbolically marrying himself to the city of rome um and uh this very this massively strengthened the connection between augustus and not just the roman state not just like the the the instruments of political power but it hugely strengthens his relationship between rome and everything about rome like like symbolism religion all these different things right and so so you could sort of see augustus is now sort of the husband of rome and that's basically how augustus becomes king without becoming without ever calling himself king right in fact he never really called us himself emperor for that no yeah he calls himself uh uh you know the first citizen the prince the first citizen yeah it's amazing augustus is an astounding character super brilliant brilliant guy yeah yeah okay so that's that's a little bit about city founding rituals um and there's a whole lot more uh if you want to go down rabbit trails on this and kingship in general there's a book i think you can find the pdf on on the internet for free because it's very old book but it's just called the ancient city a study on uh the religion laws and institutions of greece and rome um and um it's it's a really really old book that i think was recently translated into english in like 2001 i want to say but you can find a pdf of this out there if you want to read a lot more about this so i'm going to kind of pivot from there not so much pivot but transition from there into talking about holy week so holy week again we start out with this idea so we started with this idea of of the bridal chamber of br of and with this the service of bridegroom mountains right and so we have uh christ the bridegroom as kind of the central figure um and there's there are several there's several parables about um i was just looking around i have a christ christ the bridegroom image around here we'll show it yeah yeah we'll put one up this is a really important icon this will be the icon that will actually be in the church for these four days um this is a really important icon because it shows christ as a king but as like a suffering king yeah because it shows him as a king but he's got the he's got the scarlet robes that the soldiers put on him and he has the crown of thorns and he is the reed that they put in his hand it's of course this is one of those things where they're you know symbolism literally happens jonathan yeah where where like they're doing these things to him to mock him but actually what they're doing is revealing him for who he is right and so but if you think about that narrative uh the basic narrative of the city founding myth the king comes to the city he uh right and it's born to understand that it starts with the with the palm sunday yeah triumphal entry yeah so the king comes to the city and he enters in this triumphant way right uh people acclaim him people you know and you could say it's the it exactly corresponds if you've ever been to an eastern orthodox wedding it exactly corresponds right to that the entry into the narthex when the bride and the groom meet right and they're still on the narthex right still at the gate uh but they meet and they're sort of like joined and they're betrothed right that's what palm sunday is it's sort of like the betrothal right and then christ ascends to the high place of the city of rome sends to the hype or not of rome of jerusalem he sent to the high place of his city this is i mean he's christ is both you know divinely you know he's he's yahweh the god of israel so this is his city this is zion is the city where god put his name right so this is his city but also this is the city because it's the city of david who is christ's ancestor according to the flesh right so christ is christ is the king right he's the king uh he's the king both you know originally you know why why does the kingship and the why is the kingship and the priest who had split out originally well in in the mosaic law it's because god is supposed to be their king yeah right and so on by that standard christ is king of he's king of the jews right he's king of israel but then by the kind of the new davidic you know the relatively speaking new uh institution of kingship in in israel right the davidic kingship christ is gay so this is his city he comes as king and people know it people acknowledge him um you know hosanna to the son of david right so he comes up and he comes up to the high place in and in the synoptic gospels matthew mark and luke uh what we see is that after his triumphal entry as he comes up to the high place the holy place the mountain of you know of god the temple in the midst of the city he comes up there but what does he find he finds it's become corrupt he finds that it has become uh you know there are it's supposed to be a house of prayer but you turn it into a den of thieves right and this is when he drives the money changers out of the temple and this is not the gospels um it's right after his triumphal entry so the thing that's supposed to happen if you're kind of following this ancient blueprint is that christ would ascend and he would consummate his relationship with the city in the temple right you could say this would be something like going into the temple and offering a sacrifice or as god going to the temple and accepting worship accepting sacrifice and what he does instead is um is to drive the money changers out but in a way he also restores the heart like yes restoring the center he's he's cleaning it out like he's he's removing the ash and he's making it like pristine again you could say yes but this is also like the basis of now the jews are like okay we really do have to kill him this time yeah right so it so this is like the basis you could say it's always when you hit somebody's uh pocketbook right this is the basis of this is the basis of the the final rejection of the jewish people the jewish religious leaders the priestly class this is the fight this is the basis of their final rejection of christ so much so that they are willing to do what has to be done to kill him so christ goes out of the city immediately after approaching the temple he leaves the city of jerusalem and as it just says kind of a very interesting note there's not a single time in the gospels that i've ever ever been able to find uh and petite talks about this in his book as well that christ spends the night in the city of jerusalem as an adult never happens and um so he doesn't consummate his relationship he cleanses it so you could say he restores it to his virginal state yeah right but then he doesn't consummate the relationship he goes outside of the city and he stays the night he usually spends the night in bethany in fact most of the time when jesus is in jerusalem he's like teaching or preaching in jerusalem during the day but then he's going back to bethany to lazarus's house yeah and that's where he stays what you see is this city founding ritual that is sort of like aborted it sort of goes wrong and the thing that it culminates in is you could say a murder leading to a marriage okay the thing that culminates in is what his bridal chamber outside the city outside the walls of jerusalem and his bridal chamber is the tomb right and so this is the this is the way that the church presents it to us and encourages us to think about it is is of christ's burial in the tomb among other things right is his entry into his bridal chamber where he consummates his relationship not with the physical city of jerusalem but with his new city which is the city of god the heavenly jerusalem which is the church and that's the you could say that's like the core idea of holy week yeah and it's if you start to think about it it's so it's just it's always like every story that is related to christ it always just smashes so many things if you start to think about the relationship um you know between this murder this this sacrifice that happens and how it's outside the city and then also when christ dies it says that you know the veil of the temple is ripped and so he goes his his bride chamber is the tomb and it's at the same time the the holy of holies at the same time so he actually goes it's like he fills up he goes all the way up and all the way down at the same time because you know when he's on the cross he says right tomorrow you'll be with me in paradise which is like which is a weird thing to say because he's gonna spend it you know he's gonna spend some time in the tomb there um but there's a mystery happening where he both in like you said consummates his actual kingship and priesthood in going into the holy of holies and into the garden of eden but then also reaches the bottom of the world and kind of makes the whole world his kingdom you could say so here's the uh and when you said mention the the tearing of the veil this made me think about this um here's one that i've been kind of pondering over the last couple of weeks as as we're coming up on and i think as we're recording this western christians are already in their holy week yeah um um but as we're coming up on holy week so something i've been thinking about is on holy monday the scripture readings and the liturgical service focuses our attention on joseph the patriarch right and this you know um you know technicolor joseph right um my brother was in a production a couple of years ago of of the the amazing technicolor dreamcoat which is a which was awesome uh it was a lot of fun but uh yeah so joseph has all of this right of course the story of joseph is the story of christ yeah very betrayed by his brethren right but something i've never really noticed before right is this joseph goes into the he goes into the the house of potiphar right and he's there in the house of potiphar and then he um who who does seem to have like some kind of a priestly role right um and so because he's a eunuch which is weird yeah so he goes to the house of is potiphar eunuch i think so i don't i don't think no he's not okay well i don't think so i don't think so to fact check that yeah that could explain why his wife was trying to get with joseph i guess but anyway i'm sorry all right that's okay so so um so you got joseph he goes from the house with pothofar who is this priestly individual and um while he's in the house of potiphar right the the wife of potafar tries to seduce him right um and so there's a consummation that is supposed to happen or not supposed to happen but there's a consummate well the consummation that should happen right is between potiphar and his wife but there's something impure in the relationship right there's something missing or something off yeah so what does joseph do joseph flees and when he flees his veil his garment is torn right you know torn from him in this case um but just kind of thinking about the the symbolic resonance between that and christ coming to the coming to the high place coming to the temple but it's impure because the people of god have have become they've prostituted themselves out right they're they're they're they're serving mammon right and so they and so christ leaves and when he he leaves you know what happens his garments are torn but also like the veil of the temple is torn you know kind of kind of showing you know among other things god's not there he's over here but um yeah so there's a lot of there's a lot of really interesting resonance i think um more than more than i think i i i i initially realized you know even growing up as a little kid you can read the story of joseph and be like oh this is obviously you know a type of christ but i think there's also a way in which there's a surprising idea that i see in the story of joseph obviously than sort of christ is that there's a manner in which this transaction which happens is a way to save this egyptians yeah first and so it's like you you change those people that are in even like if you read saying greg are images of of this world of death of this world of animality this world of the stranger you know he you know saint gregory talks about the relationship between the egyptian and circumcision and like killing the egyptian has to do with circumcision like all of this imagery is very strong and so there's a sense in which christ goes there's a transaction which happens because the the the jewish representatives sell him to rome so that they can kill him and then they kill him because obviously the jews don't kill jesus directly the the romans physically do and then he goes into death and there's something about that which is related to him becoming the king of the romans yeah well and that's the thing i kind of wanted to point it out point out i mean the whole basic idea of universal history is the way that is the stories that we tell about ourselves as cultures and cities things like this the ways that they're sort of caught up into the kingdom of god and even all the stuff we're talking about with romulus and remus and the vessel virgins and augustus and all this stuff like there's a there's a cringy internet fedora wearing atheists read on all of this which is like oh see christianity is just like a bad collage of all this other stuff but if you really understand what's going on uh what you can see is is again if there's a true pattern you'll find it in the story of christ right there's no there's no pattern that's true that's not there in his story there's also a working out of this pattern which is bringing into it bringing it to a universal level right it's like it's taking local realities and things that are somewhat off like a good example would be let's say the relationship between mars and vesta and uh yeah yeah yeah maria there's something which is pointing towards christ but which is off and we know it's off because right like it's because obviously she's still if she's raped by god she's not a virgin and so there's something that and she has to you know there's something that doesn't make any sense and so in the story of christ the best of that story gets taken in there and then gets solved like the problem gets solved in terms of the relationship between god and and and virginity and how that brings about the true son of god ultimately and that's something like you said which it's i think that for us for a lot of orthodox and for you and i not only is that not a problem but it is like a beautiful it's like a beautiful grand narrative poem that is uni that is happening all over the world that is coming into its its powerful resolution yeah it's a feature not a bug exactly it's a future feature not a bug yeah that that whole idea that that uh you could say like to manifest the true king you would need someone who who is both a virgin and a mother and uh but and to manifest the true king you need someone that is divine and human yeah and that and the way it's presented in all the ancient stories it's like a weird hybrid he ends up being a strange hybrid and so you know there's something off about the character always um and it's always like uh it's always like someone someone's married and then the god comes and takes them or there's it's always like a rape of some kind it's like it's like an imposition of the god on reality which brings about and so that's why civilization itself has violence at its core i mean the you know rama remus and romulus are the sons of mars and there's a reason why rome has such blood on its hands like and that blood is not only there but it's glorified it's part of its story there's something which is conquering nature is so so prevalent uh and so that gets transformed with christ into something which is far more powerful and then like i said way more universal because it it brings a story to its resolution and avoids the trappings of the of the other versions yeah so so tuesday the focus maybe this ties in i don't know i'm still kind of mulling over this one so maybe you can help me understand it the focus for tuesday the gospel reading is about the baron fig tree right christ goes to the fig tree and the thing is he comes to the fig tree and it even tells us in the text that that this is not the right time for figs right um but he comes to the victory and he finds it fruitless and so he curses it right and then the fig tree withers um to me this has to do with this has mostly to do with the removing of garments yeah this is what's going on it's like christ is going back into one of the things christ is doing doing many things one of the things he's doing is he's going back into the temple going back into paradise so as he goes back into paradise he removes the fig garment you know he he he removes the garments of fig leaves and that's the cursing of the fig tree from the syrian says it that way like he sees the cursing of the fig tree as the removal of the of the fig garments i've forgotten that so that that goes really well then with a couple of things one is is obviously the focus on the previous day is joseph losing his garment to potiphar's wife right which is the another way that garment of skin is being removed um and then also the focus of bridegroom matins is this idea that i'm not ready for the wedding right i'm not ready for the bridal chamber why because i have no wedding garment right and so there's also there's also a um you could say an acknowledgement the whole purpose of of the holy week services for the first four days starting sunday evening uh the whole focus of holy holy week services is to to sort of reveal our nakedness right to acknowledge our own nakedness before god right and also remember that in the entry into jerusalem there's also removal of garments people take remove their garments their outer garments and put their rights as he walks into the city so all this idea of removing garments and finding glorious garments is something which is preparing itself if you understand what baptism looks like in the orthodox tradition and how it works you can understand that all this is coming together right and of course this is all that angle is all headed towards holy saturday which is the traditional day for the baptism of catechumens in the orthodox church obviously nowadays we do it on different days but originally holy saturday that's that's kind of the day yeah so the next day uh the focus on um um the focus on a holy tuesday evening is the uh um or the i guess that yeah the focus on the focus on tuesday holy tuesday the focus is on the entry into the temple and the cleansing of the temple which we've talked about yeah right um and of course you could say like trade itself is a garment of skin for a culture right um you know that's why we're always talking about the economy the economy the economy right um this is kind of you know money trade things like this um things that aren't really generative right uh trade doesn't actually create things it just moves them around yeah um uh and um this is why among other things this is why uh uh lending out money at interest is associated with sodomy in for instance dante's divine comedy right um because because neither neither are they're punished in this circle of hell because neither one of them are generative right um and then this brings the focus this focus uh sort of culminates on holy tuesday evening uh when we read the parable of the ten virgins um and of course this is the whole idea of getting ready for the getting ready for the wedding yeah um and then holy wednesday evening we focus on the betrayal of christ by judas which i'd be interested to there's a lot going on with judas right like it's one of the main one of the main images in christianity right is christ betrayal by judas um of course it's one of the main things there are multiple psalms that prophesy this pre-figure this right and um you've got judas um there's a there's a you know an image that's just sort of fixed in my mind of uh at the at the mystical supper judas getting up and he puts on his cloak and he goes out right you know and um and then of course he's using what is he betraying christ for he's trading christ for money exactly right right yeah absolutely an idea of exchange right and the same idea that was in the temple right it's the idea of like exchange for a sacrifice right you know so so yeah so all of this stuff is is coming and it's kind of all obviously this is gonna culminate in the uh in uh the service of good friday which in both the east and the west uh it's been historically celebrated slightly differently um by the way i just want to say one thing but i'm not going to explain it but it's okay i've talked about this in other videos i i think i talked about it before but but there's a removal of clothing at the time of judas's betrayal as well because because who is supposedly saint mark which is right not named as he was running away from the mount of olives his garment gets removed and he runs down down to the hill naked basically what a weird little detail what a very strange gospel st mark yeah that's right yeah but it's important i think it has to do with it there's something about there's something about a weird like this removing of garment and shame it's not clear but there's there's there's definitely a pattern because because you understand the amount of olives as i've talked about this how in the when christ goes up and the the disciples stay down at the bottom and they they fall asleep that this is really a very powerful cosmic image of going up towards the holy place and then people forgetting it's it's almost moses going up and people worshiping the golden calf at the bottom of the mountain it's a version of that story and so the idea that as they run away and someone as their run is scattering you know as christ is being betrayed then there's this strange moment where uh it's almost this the garment is removed i and it's so it's so like if the categories don't they just smash it's hard yeah yeah everything jumbles up right at the passion you know just like symbolically it's very difficult to you could say like disentangle it because it's that because there's so much going on and there's things that seem to signify two opposites at the same time constantly two opposites at the same time so it's like you know is it the nakedness of shame of noah right in his tent that his brain is happening or is it the same with christ on the cross himself is is his nakedness on the cross the nakedness of shame or is it the nakedness in the garden and the answer is it's both at the same time both yeah yeah but it's just hard you can't really hold it in your mind when you're not when you're thinking about it well even even things like so you know judas goes to who does he go to to make the exchange he goes to the he goes to the temple right he goes to the temple to make that exchange yeah right and then later on when uh there it's it's when they're at the you know if not at the temple itself they're in the precincts of temple because they're the the house of the high priest that's when peter betrays christ right um and so you have yeah this this whole it's where we're not going to disintegrate the whole thing we're supposed to stay on the line of the bridegroom i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry there's so much going on there's so many so many things just converge all at once i mean this is the master pattern this is the that's right it's the basis of the universe existing right as this moment so um and so on thursday night um to talk a little bit about what we do in our liturgical practice um you know on thursday evening what we do is uh is we do this beautiful service called the twelve gospels in the orthodox church um and um i think that i think that uh they do the foot washing in in uh the monday thursday in in some western practices some i don't yeah yeah but uh but that's the night that i think that's the night that it happens i think or no isn't it the same night as the betrayal um thursday i think it's on i think it's i think it's on thursday but uh you know i don't yeah yeah we didn't actually do any of that stuff when i was a protestant at the church church that i was in you know we had an easter service but that was it um and so the only liturgical tradition i've spent a lot of really enough time to really form me in any way is obviously been in the eastern orthodox church though i've studied a lot and i'm a about various different ways that this is done so in um in the eastern orthodox search on holy thursday night we're actually having it's a friday morning service right uh and what we do is we read the entire passion gospel account from all four gospels this is a pretty long service it takes quite a while and it's inner it's interspersed with some really beautiful hymnography that is um a lot of it is from the perspective of the virgin which is not incidental to what we're talking about today right um much of that hypnography and the hypnography of holy week in general is sort of walking along with her as she's watching her son right where he's the he's the bridegroom whose bride rejected him right and then she's the uh she's the unwedded bride right and so there's uh there's there's just a lot of really beautiful inner play between them in those hymns and i i always find those hymns to be the most moving and beautiful part of holy week for me yeah so at the end of this we do this thing and they it's a it's a holy friday thing in both the east and the west in in you know medieval times uh we do this thing keeping in mind that for us thursday night is at that point friday morning we do something called creeping to the cross uh that's what it was called in england this is one of the main things that the reformers were trying to do away with um it's a whole different conversation to talk about the ways that for instance the english reformation changed the way that holy day was celeb the holy week was celebrated in england but one of the main things that the protestant reformers in england were really keen to get rid of was this practice of creeping to the cross which is basically in the west they would veil all of the icons in the church um which is you know talking about this this imagery of failing and unveiling right the garments of skins so what they would actually do at the beginning of lent is they would they would veil all of the images in the church and some england i think there are i know for a fact that there are still some anglican churches that do this today i don't think that this is typically done in uh like roman catholic parishes like novus ordo but i could be wrong some of them might do it i'm not sure uh but they do they have this practice of veiling everything and what happens on holy friday is that they unveil the cross and they unveil a cross and there's like a a ceremony in medieval england there was a ceremony they would do this and that the priest would sing i had the words here somewhere he was saying behold the wood of the cross on which hung the savior of the world come let us worship so he was seeing this three times and then while lifting the veil and then once the veil was lifted um it's not just a cross obviously it's a crucifix the whole parish the whole church would come forward and they would kiss the feet of christ which is also something and at the end of that 12 gospel services at least in my parish that's something we do is we come forward at the end we prostrate before the crucifix and we kiss christ's feet as sort of as we go out um and so this is uh this is you could say the moment of the wedding um and in fact in medieval england uh this would be the first kiss the first time that you actually got to kiss anything in church all holy week um because they would uh uh normally in medieval mass in england they had something called the pax breed the pox breed the piece it's like the sign of peace and it was like uh it's like a little metal icon and they would pass this around at the time of the passing of the piece in uh in the in the mass it was literally like something that you passed and you would kiss it uh and it was a way of if you were people in medieval england for instance didn't take communion except usually once or twice a year at easter and maybe christmas right so this was your thing that you got to do with the liturgy and actually if you pass it around in the wrong order it's supposed to be sort of be passed around in the order of the social hierarchy of the parish so if you pass it around the wrong order fights could break out in the middle of mass um it's pretty pretty fun times great yeah yeah good good stuff but um but they wouldn't pass this during holy week because christ was betrayed with a kiss right which is another kind of weird aspect of the wedding imagery i think yeah right um and so uh and so this would be the first time in a in the medieval west like that you would actually kiss something in church all week during the holy week and the next day the next day uh the holy friday in both the east and the west uh what we basically do is we have a funeral for christ um and so what uh what we do in the orthodox church today as probably many people are watching this will know is that uh we've got a couple of services one where we're actually sort of performing a funeral for christ and so we have an icon called the burial shroud um that we carry around the building we carry actually carried around the church there are psalms you know laments and things like this that we sing and then we lay it in this ritual tomb which we've actually built in the middle of the church and the ritual tomb has a cool name in greek which i don't remember um but they actually had this in the west as well so in medieval england they would either build a temporary sepulcher in the middle of the church just like we usually do in our parish practice or if you had a well-appointed uh parish in if you had a well-appointed parish in in england um then there might actually be a permanent sepulcher kind of up by the altar but kind of off to one side and that's what was used and uh an interesting difference in our practice versus the practice in medieval england is that typically speaking we lay two things to signify christ being in the tomb one is this one is this um one is this icon this burial shroud that we talked about which is like people understand that it's a shroud it's a shroud but on the shroud is an image of christ laid in the tomb right yeah so it's a it's a yes right it can be painted sometimes it's stitched yeah it can be a stitched image it depends on kind of like a meta shroud sort of because it's like a shroud of a shroud but then and then we take uh and then we also take the gospel look we laid on top of that and then in our parish we also what we do then is we take the veils um i know there's probably a better name for the these but we take the veils that we would normally use to veil the eucharist right and we actually use those so if you read the scriptures again it's interesting to see like think about this this idea of garments being removed right because when christ is laid in the tomb he's wrapped and then there's like another veil a napkin that's kind of folded over his face right and a nice detail is that when jesus leaves the tomb uh the the the wrappings are empty but the napkin has been nicely folded christ is apparently very tidy i don't know what else to do with that you know but um and so when uh so we when we lay when we lay christ in the tomb liturgically like ritually we take these two veils right and we place them one over his face and then i think one yeah so it's it's a really beautiful kind of maybe that's just like a slavic thing or a microphone i don't know we don't yeah i've never seen that in our i've never done posca at any other paris pairs yeah exactly yeah yeah so somebody out there who watching this knows a lot more than i do so maybe you can let us know um all right so in the east or sorry in the west in medieval england just as an example again um they had a few different ways they would do this the first thing that they would do is instead of making it uh an icon of the gospel book they would have the crucifix which they would take and they would lay in the tomb and um and then they would also have uh they would have had a pre-consecrated host a eucharistic host and they actually lay that they would put that in like a small uh pics is what it was called like a small little container and then actually place that in the tomb as well some churches there was there's one church in late medieval england just a couple hundred years before the reformation that actually had a very beautiful elaborate carved crucifix with a removable compartment in the chest with a picks in it and so what they would do for holy friday is that they would actually remove this compartment they would put the consecrated host in that and then place it back in and lock it up and then put that in the tube right which is pretty that's pretty that's it's it's kind of cool like it's interesting also to think about the the the um about the the uh the ark of the covenant and the mana inside the art you know and the law inside the ark because i've seen the the bible on the when we use the bible but the idea of putting an actual consecrated piece of bread there yeah and um what duffy says uh last last video i think we talked about i i mentioned the stripping of the altars which is a really important um uh book i think but he says that this sepulcher is the the interpretive crux for understanding uh popular religion in late medieval england right the purpose of this sepulcher was to focus obviously the symbolic focus of holy week christ cross and passion and all this but also to reinforce the doctrine of the eucharist which was really was already even before the reformation in england coming under fire dramatically by people like the lawlers who i mean would and these are people who would go into churches they would steal pixes and then they would take the host and they would trample on it or defile it in some other way right in a public way to show i don't believe that there's anything here right yeah um and so um and so this this corresponded with the watch that would be kept over the tomb which is something we do in the orthodox church today something they did in the medieval west as well um and in this watch that they keep over the tomb you know there are a couple of things going on one is it there's then there's the nice symbolism of like keeping the watch of the tomb but there's also the fact that there were people who actually wanted to steal and defile the the consecrated host right and then also the fact that the picks was usually made from you know precious metal as it should be and so for all these kind of reasons you would want to keep watch so they would they would usually hire um you know like the church warden or other men in the parish and uh to keep watch all night um and and this was uh in the middle ages this was an armed watch that would actually keep and what it sort of means is like you kind of go there there are two kinds of people who keep watch of the tomb of christ right there's the mother of god who keeps watching over the tomb this is uh this is in the father saint gregory palamas talks about this um but then there's also the soldiers right the soldiers who keep watch over the tomb yeah right and so it's like which one am i sometimes yeah so the body won't be still interesting yeah yeah so so it's just interesting to see how this these patterns kind of just like manifest themselves in these ways that christians celebrate holy week um and then of course all of this culminates on holy uh with holy saturday which is the day of baptism it's the day that new christians are received into the church um and it's also the day of you know the harrowing of hell the defeat of hell in both the east and the west for instance in anglo-saxon england uh before the norman conquest there was a really beautiful basically it's basically a poetic rewriting of the gospel of nicodemus that they would actually read in old english they would actually read this liturgically in the church on holy saturday so um so pretty cool stuff pretty cool stuff and then um holy saturday obviously that that culminates in the easter vigil so but i it seems like if you just study the way that holy week has been celebrated by christians in both east and the west everything sort of converges on the sepulcher and i think the two symbolic patterns that seem to manifest the most are uh one this this pattern of the removing of the garments that that you talked about and then this idea uh which is related to that of christ as brighter like what happens on a wedding night well the bride removes her veil right um what's interesting is that you really see like the difference between you can see the difference so in so we do have the notion of the glorious king as christ ascends to heaven as christ resurrects there's this sense in which you know we see christ up in the dome that you have this glorious king but you also understand that there is this glory like this position that he holds goes through the cross and goes through the tomb and that it actually transforms the hierarchy like i always i talk about the notion that at the top of the christian hierarchy is something like self-sacrifice and that it's actually not and it's not arbitrary once you see it and you understand it you realize that that's actually how reality works reality actually holds together through through self-sacrifice um and we won't go into it too much into it here you can find talks on my channel about this but but yeah self-sacrifice is the kind of sacrifice that is the basis of marriage right exactly of a true marriage of a christian the whole idea of like a sacrifice leading to a marriage right that's that's the because i mean that's the thing like like uh putting you know that idea of like the meta desire right and the idea of like putting your put let let's let's take all that tension and that disagreement between us because we're competing for the same resources whatever let's take that stuff and let's put it on the scapegoat well that's a temporary solution yeah historically what's the long-term solution that basically every human culture has come up with for saying how do we share resources in a way that's going to be sustainable not just for us but for the people who come after us is through marriage right yeah yeah and then you see this whole image of this whole image of the the parents or the the you know the parents that give their attention their love to their children and then don't see their children as competition they see there's a different relationship of yeah of of giving and and love it's very different so you can understand how it's a different image of how reality holds together one which is still based on sacrifice yeah rather than because you can see like even in terms of a family you can understand how you've seen it because sadly you see families like that where a black sheep in the family is useful you know in order to cohere the family it's like around that around that one point yeah everything is that person's fault and so then you're able to cohere but that this is like you said it's temporary and it's always leading to some kind of uh some kind of revenge at some you know in some future at some future time but that the true nature of of of a bond of love which brings about self-sacrifice is the one that is the only one that really holds reality together and what happens if you have that black sheep in like a family or even like a friend group right there the more you commit to that the less possibly becomes actually reconciled to that person yeah because there's actually a danger and i've seen this in in families and friend groups and things like this where there's a danger of if we all decide we're going to forgive this person then the thing that was actually allowing us to cohere is gone and then the group just dissolves exactly yeah and yeah then it's mayhem all all around yeah yeah and so i think marriage is a um you know the famous monty python quote strange women lying in pawns distributing swords is not a basis for a system of government well i also don't believe that murder is a is a basis for a system of government right or like uh a basis for a culture um not because there's not some truth to gerard's ideas but because uh they're incomplete right and i think that what we see in holy week is the completion right there is something of the scapegoat there obviously christ christ is both goats as they say on lord's spirits right but the focus the focal point of all of that does seem to be for me uh in the tomb and you could say the tomb that is a bridal chamber that's the place where these things can actually join and cohere yeah yeah all right everybody i think that's a great way to suit themselves and so i wish everybody a i don't know when we're gonna try to put that as soon so for for all of you all that are on the western uh calendar i wish you uh a productive and a good holy week and the same for all the orthodox watching next week uh you know there's still just yeah it's almost there's just a little time left and i know lent has been hard for a lot of people including me and including richard this year and so we pray for the grace to uh to uh to struggle through and uh and to all find ourselves in the glory of the of the resurrection so thanks everybody for your attention and we'll see you very soon this episode is part of a series of discussions i've had with richard roland on universal history you can find a list of all these episodes on my youtube channel where you can find them also in my podcast stream from the symbolic world on your different podcast platforms make sure to check out richard's second podcast which he hosts in collaboration with father andrew damick called amman sewell which looks at the relationship between tolkien and orthodoxy this podcast has also inspired me some ideas for creating some images whether it be the king under the mountain whether it be the grail or beautiful ethiopian traditions i've created some products which you can find on my store the symbolicworld.store and there will probably be more of those to come very soon so stay tuned this conversation is ongoing and there is still very much to explore in the universal history
