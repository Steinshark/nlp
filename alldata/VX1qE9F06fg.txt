ladies and gentlemen on this YouTube channel I talk about Chess some of you knew that already some of you might be watching me for the first time welcome to the channel it's called Gotham chess it's not called Gotham Checkers poker smoothies or anything else and I bring you everything I bring you Hikaru versus Magnus I bring you chess Bots and AIS and cheater content but I have an entire playlist here called how to lose a chess where low ELO games are analyzed made fun of dissected laughed at turned into educational content and shown to all of you today's game was sent to me by a subscriber from Brazil and it's low ELO chess content but it's 900 ELO chess so it's probably three to four times higher than some of your elos and this game was tough this game had almost no good moves but it had one and that one was a rook sacrifice and if you know anything about me it means I'm going to turn it into content now my friends if you're lucky enough to catch this video in the first 24 hours then it's out all courses 25 off still a little sale going on because we have the new Dutch defense course also if you'd like literally listen to me if you want any of my courses for free they are available there are massive free samples so take your chest learning into your own hands it's played by Fisher not Bobby he's not alive uh who is a 930 rated player from Brazil and Sir John who's literally as close as possible as you could be to 9 30 without being 9 30. and you may notice there are no clocks that's because this was a daily game the players had seven days to make every single move that's 168 hours that's nine thousand something I don't know not minutes whatever anyway the game began with Pawn to D4 and black responded with Pawn to E6 which is completely fine so far so good black of course would like to play D5 C5 maybe F5 I don't know what black is going to play right if you play D4 E6 it means you're okay with the transposition you have to you have to remember just because white started with the Queen's Pawn doesn't mean white Cam play E4 on the second move so E6 is a very interesting decision uh by black uh and white goes for London white has shown their cards they'd like to play London and uh they're going to play e-cig E3 Knight F3 Knight D2 C3 finish the pyramid now I really hate Black's next move what plays Queen F6 so Queen F6 is basically the scholars mate Right In Reverse it's like developing your queen early I hate it for a few reasons number one Queen F6 is a bad move just objectively speaking past a certain point in chess it's just a bad move second of all it's bad against this opening because white is so solid you're never mating and it's literally impossible to mate White third of all you're 900 which you shouldn't be playing it at this time fourth of all this is a daily game white has seven days not to blunder something stupid like you have to understand if you're playing this in bullet it's one thing three minute one thing even 10 minute white has literally one week per move per move white could spend six days another six days another six days another say or I don't know I don't know if that's the way it works if it resets or what white plays E3 because that's the London and and now black has nothing and the thing is when this queen comes out and I have a video called how to punish early Queen attacks like black can't play with the queen early not to mention if any of you are wondering if that's a free pawn it is it's a hundred percent the Free Pawn yeah black can do something like this and trap your Bishop but first of all you can always take second of all nobody's actually attacking you so you could just develop and third of all you could always run that way so even if B6 happens you just take the Knight now okay E3 fine I mean I told you there was like no good moves right now black plays Knight C6 okay I really wish black would have just developed the night last move but fun um white plays Knight C3 not necessarily the best move it's probably better to build the to build build the Pyramid but okay Knight C3 now Black's next move makes negative sense negative it makes less sense than zero no disrespect to sajan I'm sure so John's probably a very nice guy probably successful Tech entrepreneur I don't know or he's like eight years old I don't know anyway black spends two days I don't know seven hours I don't plays Knight to B4 now Knight to B4 is bad because it violates about five different principles number one why are you making multiple moves with a piece in the opening if you're not capturing something or attacking something this move attacks nothing nothing it's a it's a night Venture the Knight sees the pawns which is covered in my book by the way I have an entire chapter dedicated to Vision attacking capturing pre-order it sixteen thousand pre-orders probably gonna drop us a New York Times bestseller just saying oh and if you're in the UK you can get a 25 off a lot of promos a lot of promos but I'm excited a lot a lot of cool stuff coming up like book is coming out and course sales and it's all to make you better and yes it's paid content but I mean kind of you know we live in a capitalist dystopia so Knight to B4 targets these pawns but you shouldn't make night moves like this like what was Black's plan after A3 I don't know they were gonna spend another seven days anyway night before is played now Knight to B4 okay Knight to B4 would make sense if there was a bishop here so white moves the bishop now look man I okay so essentially moving the bishop to D3 moving the bishop to D3 okay um basically here's what happened black drove a car through someone's house and made a hole terrible thing to do you know what white does starts taking the same hole thinking it's a tunnel bro no that was a really bad thing that black just did but white should not that's not supposed to you're not supposed to justify your opponents terrible and it doesn't even take it doesn't even take what are they spending the seven days on I don't know why just develops okay I mean I really wish this bishop went literally to any other Square except maybe not that one because this could just take and I mean that is what black should do that is unquestionably the best move is to take the bishop because it's just a bishop you're just getting a bishop and then afterward you know after something like this you know you're you're gonna have a bishop and why won't anyway D6 is played and it doesn't take very long for black to lose the game uh because you know black plays D5 and uh black is lost black is lost because black did three things wrong in the opening brought their Queen out moved the Knight twice and moved the pawn twice so the players have made six moves each but it looks like black only made four moves right like it okay I suppose this is a two mover but black is a move behind now Knight B5 is crushing because it threatens that it's very hard to defend that it's impossible to defend that without losing a pawn you gotta you're gonna lose something and then on top of that there is another thing here which black does not realize black goes here black loses black loses the game now this is the stuff that drives me absolutely nuts with beginner level chess this is this should not be beginner level chess there is a checklist that must go through your head folks I got this book right here all right I got a book right here there's a whole chapter dedicated to this it's called the checklist it's called how to think in the middle game your opponent plays the move Bishop to D6 okay this is the way you're supposed to think in chess opponent plays Bishop D6 you go what is the bishop doing ah it's seeing my Bishop okay many of you would react right now and go I gotta I gotta do something no checks captures attacks the only check white has on this position is Bishop to B5 it's not a bad move but it doesn't really make a whole lot of progress black can just block you can capture a couple of things like this bishop and this pawn and that pawn but none of them really make any progress attacks starting with the maximum value not a king because you just looked at that with checks Queen Bishop G5 and by a miracle of God this move would win the Queen the queen is completely trapped if you just in if you just incorporate the checklist into your day-to-day life it will change your life in chess I don't know if it'll get you a relationship or a job but it will change your life in chess Bishop G5 just wins the game on the spot instead of that Fisher goes me Bishop targeted me defend Bishop why why folks you're just it's just this is like the most it's just so natural it's so it's just like oh there's a queen there that my opponent put okay upon to G3 Rock and now that black spends Six Days on a move or whatever and plays H6 okay H6 now and now Bishop G5 is just not is you just can't play it anymore bro this is a daily game you know what white does in this position my for every move these two made violated something in chess I'm not even trying to make fun of them I'm not they're 900 they gotta set a better example the way you think in chess when the checklist doesn't get you anywhere we just talked about the checklist how do you determine in chess what's a good move you have to make a move that either puts pressure on your opponent or improves your position in some capacity that might involve a pawn trade a peace trade for instance wouldn't it be great if in this position white could play Pawn to E4 and that would result in a knight targeting some stuff that would be nice but if you play E4 black can take this bishop and open up your king so why don't you take this and then open up the center and this benefits you because Black's King is stuck in the center so opening up the position would give you an attack and if black captures your knight gets a little bit more activity the queen now has to go backwards you can trade the bishop off so the Knight doesn't take it then you can put your Rook on the open file maybe kick the Knight out and you've made progress that's the way you're supposed to decide what's a good move in chess your opponent plays H6 you're not supposed to play H4 you put your king there how can you move the king to the vacation home during the winter have it like what how does that even make sense the king is over there he's just opening up all the windows what is no well I guess on a vacation home you get you know Knight E7 and uh Bishop E5 traps the queen again again total Miracle completely unplanned instead of that white plays Queen E2 under normal circumstances I wouldn't mind the move Queenie too but not when you can win a queen fine Knight F5 okay now again the best move is Bishop E5 or Bishop F5 or Knight B5 white plays rookie one again the computer not a big fan computer not liking any of the moves now black does something here which is so egregious black is playing a daily game black has seven days 168 hours to come up with a good move and black plays G5 this is just a counting exercise Pawn takes Pawn takes Bishop takes and maybe black thought I'll go here and I'll go here and it will be Checkmate that's three moves in a row I don't know what Universe you live in that ain't happening it's not happening first of all something will block you second of all I'm gonna fight back on the H file you don't just get to mate me but instead of that black plays G5 and now white plays E4 you know what E4 is E4 is the equivalent of Chess Russian Roulette you want my bishop or my Pawn or my Pawn or my Pawn or my Pawn or my bishop or my Pawn or my bishop or my Pawn or my Pawn whatever doesn't matter chess Russian Roulette load a bullet in the chamber and it's gonna hit somebody you want all of that and white ones may be a pawn or a knight or a pawn or a bishop or a pawn or a pawn or a this is what's happening in this position it's just what's happening all right now here we go let's roll the dice Knight takes D4 okay great now I could take a pawn or a bishop or a pawn or a fork or a pawn or a knight instead of that we move our Queen makes sense makes sense because if you were watching closely in this position taking all of this is nice but you would lose a queen and it would be check that's the most important thing of course you would take the night here instead of that we go here now black has the same situation I can take a bishop or a knight or a bishop or a bishop or a pawn or upon black plays Pawn takes H4 one of the worst moves possible now checks captures attacks what is worth the most in Black's position ponza E5 the queen and simultaneously closing off the diagonals and E5 would simply win material but white can also capture the pawn and the pawn and the Knight and the bishop and the pawn and the pawn so what does white do Knight takes D5 seven days to come up with a move you lose a knight in one move gun the only reason the advantage is still back to White side is if you find the fork and not if you play Pawn take C5 that is definitely not the move you know why white did this you know why white sacrifice the Knight because it's a check that was the whole reason s to come up with a damn move seven seven a week a week of time and you go check why are you playing daily chess now black can move the king can move the king in general you don't want to lose the right to Castle but it's worse to pin yourself and create a very big Target for your opponent Bishop E7 all the advantages back to White now because of Knight takes Knight Queen takes Knight and uh this is a fork but it's actually even more brutal than that this is why you always look for checks in chess in this position it looks like white can go here creating a fork on these two pieces and that would be a good move if not for the fact that white has one check in this position and it just so happens to be a discovered attack on the Queen Bishop B5 check no way to protect the queen doesn't matter where black moves and now white is completely winning you have to look for checks you never know sometimes the check is winning sometimes it does nothing but you have to look this should be for Knight takes F3 Bishop takes F3 Pawn take G3 Pawn takes G3 now we have a moment to breathe black plays Rook GA the attack Roars forward pressure pressure by the way this Knight is just here that's just a horse wandering on the edge of the road any of you drive a car okay everybody not from America just says no I ride a bicycle and walk like a normal citizen uh any of you ever hit a deer or drove like somewhere there's a deer crossing or bison or unicorns I don't know where you live or what drugs you take but uh ruchiate pressuring White's King and this Knight is just I just wander the craziest thing is everywhere the night looks and sees something it can like take something um now at this point you need to look at this as a threat but there's another thread here which is actually Queen takes Bishop because this is not actually defending white plays Pawn to D6 that is a interesting aggressive move now I guess the idea was that if Pawn takes Pawn white was gonna take here's something really peculiar happens rather than taking the bishop in one move black goes here now I think probably black sought discovered check but I got news for you I have no evidence of that whatsoever not none zero evidence um so Queen H4 Queen H4 was played because the logic was well they can't take me because of this is there a follow-up to this move maybe it's sacrificing The Rook Maybe uh in this position white can take the bishop with the Rook or with the pawn I don't blame white for taking it with a pawn because obviously that's mate I don't know if they saw that or if they even know Queens can go that far but also the pawn is very close to promotion but in general you should probably play the more forcing move and it's a check the reason you should play the more forcing move is because you're going to get closer to Checkmate um you have moves like you know Bishop H5 in the future or I don't know Pawn to D7 Pawn to d8 in the future getting the pawn through but you know what like I said I don't mind this move now black sacrifices The Rook thinking this is a big and successful attack now look the good news is there is a little bit of an attack the bad news is you are down a rook you're kind of down more because your pieces aren't really doing anything like just because they exist doesn't mean they're actually actively working to improve the position or the situation um so it's kind of a you know it it's it's good and bad uh you might have a draw like the players could repeat moves in fact they actually start repeating moves and then I would have I don't know if white would have found Bishop back but instead black plays Bishop to E6 so black stops mate the attack is roaring forward uh the Knight is still kind of awkwardly standing on the edge of the board and now white covers up the King which okay I will give credit for that being a decent move and maybe this is slightly exaggerated Queen goes to G3 and now my friends white woke up wasn't exactly zero good moves it was close in this position the clutch Gene kicked in the 900 ELO player kicked in and white channeled their inner Gotham White's got a queen staring down at d8 White's got a rook staring down at the bishop a rook staring down over here there's got to be a way forward that pawn is an anchor and white in this position finds a sacrifice of don't take incredible shots very simple idea if Pawn takes the Rook slides in the King has to take the pawn and The Rook gets the rook and at that point in just a little lesson for all of you the way you win a position where you have such an advantage that white has you can get it to an end game you can take as many pieces away from your opponent as possible which is exactly what white is doing and you have to make sure that you don't get Perpetual checked you have to make sure that Queen E3 check never leads the Perpetual for instance King H2 Queen F4 King G1 Queen E3 like that would be a draw but after King H1 there's no more checks and if black tries to check you you start the checks you yourself start the checks this move also wins a queen okay so that would be nice and if you missed that and instead you uh let's say trade the Queens that's fine you just have to win this position now you just have to get to an end game per motorcycle Pawn so Rook A8 black plays Knight D5 and now what I would do with uh with white is I would activate my queen I would play Queen to F3 and that is exactly what white did that is a great move simultaneously activating your queen teaming up with the rook and offering a trade and obviously this is very winnable you take that you take everybody you promote three nights and then you checkmate black gives a check white blocks black gives a check no more checks that's it beautiful finishing clinical technique here you know what first time ever I'm gonna change the video video description in the middle five good moves look at that the people who didn't make it this far in the video will never see the change in the title they'll never know they all clicked on some prank video or what what whatever y'all want Roblox Minecraft I don't know but they're not going to see the video changed and I got news for you it gets even better black tries to create some play which I do like I respect that a lot but it's too late Queen f8 check always look for checks always look for checks there are a few checks to lose the queen we have eight and now 50 50 boom very very nice a lot of these videos that I upload have really stupid endings but it's also nice if the ending is clean if the game was Goofy and they were doing some really absurd things that's one thing but I also would like to laugh and educate so I hope you enjoyed it 20 minutes spent a lot of takeaways here stop bringing the queen out so early and all you saw how to apply the checklist in a game how to apply the checklist and not be so reactive okay breaking a lot of principles like pushing Pawns in front of your king and and that that you want to avoid that you're gonna win more games if you can minimize the chaos just like a fist fight just like a fist fight we get chaos you might get knocked out less of this more of simplifying down the position and more forcing moves now get out of here but not before you check out the courses 25 off free sample maybe pre-order the book you do what you want I'm gonna listen I got 20 of them behind me over there so I gotta you know anyway get out of here the the the rare double get out of here
