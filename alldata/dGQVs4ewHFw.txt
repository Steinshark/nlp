graphic novel God's dog please join me in welcoming Jonathan pajel [Applause] so first off I really would really like to thank Eamon and Catherine and Scott for this amazing event and this amazing opportunity you know um this discussion these discussions we've been having for years now I guess it's becoming have been um they've just been wonderful to to you saw it yesterday like there's a what I've been seeing what I've been feeling is this this desire to understand each other desire to enter into real communication with each other and uh and I'm like I'm now I'm also I'm almost used to it right I'm used to it and so I'm looking at the content and the and yesterday a few people were telling me Oh you know my father was here and he was just amazed at the at the generosity and the discussion like yeah I have to always remember that that's actually the basis of why we're even able to have these discussions um and so I want to thank all of you for coming here I was right from the first day when people started arriving I was just amazed at how much people have been following this discussion and how I felt the same generosity and and openness to listen and to engage that I felt when I talked to John or when I talked to Paul um the big confession I have to make is that oh I last night I suffered greatly I was in so much pain because I was sitting right there and I had John and Paul up here and and and they were talking and exchanging and I was like you could probably see me like I was right on the edge of my seat I was like I want to jump up there and uh and get into the conversation uh so but I didn't I was respectful and uh so I so I thought I'm gonna so hope as I'm hoping that I can make them suffer a little bit this morning I'll say a bunch of things yeah and so it's funny because yesterday Paul was standing up here and he said are you gonna wing it and uh and he was like struggling with that and I prepared to talk and but with everything everybody said I I was just I went downstairs you know a little bit to kind of Center myself and pray a little bit and and I thought am I just going to do the talk or am I going to engage and I think I'm gonna engage more than just do the talk and so hopefully it's going to come together in terms of I'm gonna deal with a lot of the things that John talked about and Paul talked about yesterday and I'm going to try to pull them together basically into my talk that I had prepared uh today um so I really wanted to at the outset I wanted to dive into the the theme of the conference which was this idea of Consciousness and conscience and I think the the framing of the conference was a way to maybe try to help us think about or look at how is it that conscious experience consciousness um how is it related to morality I don't like the word morality I rarely use it I would rather use the good if that's okay with you and I'll we'll move into why I use that that term it has a long history and this is something for those who followed my my own discussions it's something that I've been fascinated with from the beginning which is the problem of what John calls combinatorial explosion the problem of framing as we approach reality that is we we realize that phenomena is too complex as an artist it's something that most anybody who's a painter or an artist you come to realize that very fast because if you sit in front of something and you're trying to draw it or paint it I was talking to someone today who is explaining that that experience uh you realize there's way too much stuff out there and I actually have to find a through line I have to discover I have to engage with a structure which is hidden or there potentially in the thing that I'm looking at and one of the things I realized when I was in my 20s was that actually that's probably how we deal with most things that we have to find a through line as John the term that John's uses which I like a lot as we frame phenomena and what I think is I think that if we understand it that way and we look at it that way we're going to come to a manner of understanding how the good uh arises from that um and so one of the things you realize and this is you've heard me talk about the glass a million times if you watch any of my videos but one of the things you realize is that when you engage with things in the world uh you engage with them with a purpose so like our categories are not just abs are not just concrete categories that are completely arbitrary but that they start at least they start in categories of engagement right so it's like a glass is something it's a container it's something that I drink from and that's why I care about it and that's why I care enough about it for me to have a category for it or for me to engage with it in a manner that that makes it hold together as a phenomena because what we what we realize is that phenomena is it is combinatory explosive there are many aspects to this like we could say you know what is it the example that's always used is I could use this as a as a weapon I could use it to prop up something I could it has all kinds of possibilities in it but I engage with it as I engage with it then it it manifests itself to us as and identity and that identity is almost in some way it's identical with its good that is when I perceive a glass I'm always judging whether it's a good glass because I want to drink from it like if I'm walking out on the floor and I'm doing it unconsciously you know some ways or I'm not doing fully consciously I'm always asking myself whether or not the floor is gonna hold me or I trust that it's going to hold me because that's why that's why I have a category for it in the first place and it's the same with even it's sometimes it looks harder when we look at the scientific categories but the scientific categories are framed first of all in our experience categories there's the just the experience that we have every day and so we why is it even in terms of science why is it that some aspects of science get more funding get more attention than others it's because they're always couched in categories of care ultimately they're couching what is important to us in terms of humans um and so what I what I realized uh a while ago is that I think that that's what Dante is talking about in the Comedia and so I've been really thinking a lot about the way that Dante engages with with uh the way that he sees the this movement that humans have out into the world and he talks about it exactly in that way he he couches it in two Notions which is love the love and the good that is all humans perceive a good toward which they move and that they at least think or at least hope that they will find rest in that good and so if you think about it every single one of your movements and anything that you do can be framed that way that is I walk into a room I have a reason why I'm walking to a room it can be a very very minimal reason it could be a small good but it has to be a good or else I wouldn't I wouldn't move I would just stand here paralyzed like but if I'm moving somewhere I'm moving in a direction towards something if I grab something I'm doing it for a reason and it's always because I'm looking to rest in a good if I grab a glasses because I think I if I drink it I will find a good there and if I you know if I'd walk into a building if I go to shopping mall if I do anything I do and sometimes that good can just be you know if I want to go for a walk and I want to free my clear my mind or whatever it is every single every single motion we do and it's I think it's probably actually most of the time true even for things that we're not totally conscious of that we actually act towards Goods we protect ourselves from things that will hurt us and we move towards things that we recognize as as being good and so the reason why I'm talking about this is because that's I think related to the problem of the combinatorial explosion problem which is the categories that we have and the categories we even perceive in the world are related to their good so you know an apple is it a good apple that means a different thing than uh a good chair or a good anything or even even in terms of science it's super interesting because because scientists when they study something they will they will reduce all the parameters down to their variables that they're looking for and they will they'll create a a frame and then they will have to judge whether or not the facts they're looking at fit the good that they're aiming for there's no other way to do it so you have to decide I'm studying this for this reason and now I have to see which facts because I'm obviously if I'm studying I'm studying a rhinoceros right it's like I'm not going to be looking at the clouds because that doesn't that doesn't fit in the good that I'm looking for and even even if I'm studying a rhinoceros I have to study the rhinoceros in a certain direction in a certain frame a certain aspect of it and then all the facts I'm going to see which facts fit in that good and some of them which don't fit so much there's always going to be things that are going to be kind of on the margin and I have to decide where do I cut off where do I remove remove the facts that don't fit into the good that I'm caring about and which ones do and then I can get to the the purpose that I'm doing so even science actually functions in that manner in the the process so often people will then describe the results of Science and say well here are these objective results and everything but those objective results are always couched in someone searching for a good and organizing facts towards a purpose and then deciding not deciding or perceiving which facts fit and aim at the good that they're that they're trying to find and sometimes a scientist will will will identify a good will start to organize facts towards that and they'll realize that no the facts just don't they don't actually you can't reach that the the thing that I'm doing my theory doesn't work so I have to find a new Theory to try to gather these facts together uh if I'm going to make sense of of the world um and so what are the things that I've one of the things that I that I've been thinking of is that that I think is ultimately just that is the source of morality or the source of the good we we see the good in things but then there's a manner in which as soon as that becomes a question of people or as soon as that becomes a question of others that I see in them a reflection of of myself I see them as like me then the good of the good of the glass which is there to drink out of becomes a different kind of good but it's not there's nonetheless that and in Dante that's the way that it's presented to us is that Dante and it has to do with love that is love is the thing that draws you towards the good one one of the one of the things I think about in terms of Dante is that we often complain about how in Latin and in the romance languages we reduce all the words for love that we're in Greek because in Greek they have you know you have was it seven words for love or five words for love and they've reduced them to one and so we lost so much but I think that although maybe we did lose there's also something that we gain which is we gain the notion of just the idea of something which draws you towards something else just that like what is it that draws you towards something else and then you say well that's love so it is Eros you know but that it's also Agape because Agape is also that which carries me into the other like this this open like movement towards the other but it always is it's like a motor that makes you move and it's a it's a great way to frame it because then you can actually you can apply it like I said to all the things you do because you know whether it is whether I'm brushing my teeth or whether you know I'm avoiding a puddle all of these things that I'm doing are always uh I love drawing me towards the good and trying to avoid the things that are in my way or trying to to emphasize the things that are drawing me towards the good but when we encounter people then people become for us they become for us places or things that can draw us into a different kind of good and so in Dante what happens in him is that he finds himself right in this dark place finds himself basically in a place of nihilism a place of he's he can't move he's stuck that's the that is the that's the place where you have no good and you have no love and and we've all experienced moments like that and we know people that fall into that someone who's depressed can be physically fit they're completely physically in good shape they could do all the things if they physically but they can't find a purpose to move and they can't light a love to get them to move and so they when they lay in bed all day and you're like well just get up and do something but there's no love there's no draw there's nothing pulling me forward um and so Dante finds himself in that spot and the first thing that makes him move is he encounters the poet and the the poet reveals to him Beauty something which is calling him and so Dante is a little bit you could say it's not like a little bit of love is kindled in him where he he also remembers something that had driven him before it's good that had pulled him forward and so he encounters the poet which is the one who taught him about love maybe the first thing that kindled even the notion of love in him and that made him understand but it's a person and that's why I it's not it's not an abstract thing and and this is actually going to I hope at some point it's going to also help people understand religion a little better is that humans are driven towards the good in people like we're not abstractly driven towards morality we don't very few people will act towards abstract moral principles but people will be drawn into examples and and people who reveal to you in their persons things that I want to imitate right that's how children learn that's how we that's how we exist together and often we we forget that because then we we find these ethical codes and we have all these ethical rules but we we forget that humans see in others and we move towards others we we're drawn into others and we move we move in the the in the example of others so that's what Dante experiences it's like Virgil is an example of someone who embodied Beauty someone who was able to manifest love in a a more exterior form right in poems and literature all of that and that has a powerful value but it's not enough for Dante and that Virgil leads him ultimately to Beatrice and Beatrice now there is an example of an actual erotic Awakening that he had in his life where it's like this woman captured him and gave him a motor right gave him a motor at first towards her but then in the story we see that his love was unrequited he wasn't able to to to engage with her ah but it's a person it's a person that's kind of drawing him forward and of course if you know the story of Dante then those people that he encounters they pull him further and they pull him into heaven and so this can also help you understand what heaven is because it's just so hard for the modern world to to realize that that in Dante heaven our people they are they they are people that embody the virtues that lead us towards the good and so that's they are Saints they are characters and have all through and it's the same even with the bad stuff it's all people it's all encounters with people that model sin that model passion that model excessive moderate that model violence and then it moves up into people that model virtue and that model the good more and more embedded into each other so when when Dante ascends the Heavenly spheres it's there's a reason why those heavenly spheres are inhabited by people that exemplify these this scale of goods this scale of Virtues and it's funny because even in the text because you know I think Dante this is I think this is something which would have been completely just obvious to a medieval person it was just something that's completely normal to understand but Dante was like in this interesting transition period I think he probably felt that he was in this transition period And so to warn the like Star Trek science fiction reader for of the future uh Beatrice at some point tells Dante he's like wait the souls don't actually inhabit these Heavenly spheres okay so just speak like be careful like they don't this is that we're not idiots like there aren't Souls like up in these in these uh whatever Circles of Heaven that are kind of hanging out there like looking down that's not what we're saying we're saying that the experience of the of the heavens the experience of this Ascension or hierarchy of that which is above you is there to and how does he say it she says she says at first you need your senses like we we get things from senses and from our sensual experience we then know what is fit for mind but it all starts in the the sense so it's like it's not that the souls inhabit the Heavenly spheres but that if you understand that which is above you the experience of that which is above then you can understand why these Souls that inhabit different virtues move up into greater and greater Goods um and so then he he has these experiences he moves up into the good and then he ends up in the final moment right into the love that moves all things that's how the poem finishes he finishes with him entering into the love that moves all things and you realize that the whole home was about love and about what draws us into these Goods now my my contention is that I think that Dante is helping us understand the manner in which attention functions in the most immediate way that it's not he's not just describing a moral system he's not just describing but he's actually helping us understand the manner in which attention functions through care and desire for a good and that is actually how categorization functions obviously he wouldn't actually probably have cared about this more scientific question but I think that that's he's giving us a manner to understand the process of Framing and of categorization uh but he's doing it in the way that is the most important which is understanding that all of this is couched in our experience of each other and of people that draw us into that which is good and so I think one of the things that that does one of the things that that does so I'm gonna just before uh Dante enters into the highest sphere right why just before it enters into the love that moves the universe the Trinity as the image of that love that is this multiplicity and unity which coexists together right the possibility of drawing the many into one that's the problem of attention itself and the problem of understanding how those coexist they they coexist in love and it's not an arbitrary it's not just an arbitrary thing because it's the problem you face with the glass as well because the glass is not one thing right the glass is a bunch of things and it's a bunch of things that are a bunch of things but nonetheless for some reason we are able to see that it's one like what is going on and I think the answer to that is love or you don't like the word love because it's too sappy like let's just use the word care we could say use the word Heidegger used that's fine if that's what drives us into seeing unity in multiplicity is is love of the good that that one gives you whatever that one is like whatever thing you see as one a car is not one thing right cars and millions and millions of things but nonetheless you're able to perceive it as one because it gives it offers you a good that draws you into itself and so that's also true for let's say at the Primal level it's something that you could find for all the categories it's a phenomenon I'm also let's say ing that the phenomenological experience of reality is Primal it's before whatever scientific categories you give so the reality of a of a tree is first phenomenologically the good that it offers and then if you want to start breaking down its cell structure that is helpful and it and it's fine but that there's a there's a there's a good in which we first even know that a tree is one thing because I know it sounds it sounds obvious because we all experience it all the time that we just see unity and we think that it's an obvious like oh that's the it's just one thing well it's not well it is but it's not and that's the problem that I think Dante is giving us some image of and that's why I do believe that that I think that that's the highest I think that it is one of the reasons why we have the image of the Trinity is to bring that mystery into the highest good and to the source of all things you can say the source of all things is one in many at the same time it is a perfect union perfect multiplicity and so it brings us into this image of what the source of reality is and if we say that if we don't and and it's actually a problem-solving thing it's it's I do believe that it's true I am a Christian like it's a revelation but it is also a problem-solving thing because the systems that look at the unity of all things as a as a monad as an absolute monad they tend to understand multiplicity as degenerative they always tend to move towards the notion that the multiple becomes evil in itself that as you move from the one to the many you're moving into evil itself so you see different Gnostic systems that have that structure and so of course the problem of positing just some I think very few systems would do that but just positing some multiplicity as the origin the complete origin I mean just means that we're just gonna be fighting all the time we're just gonna everything's going to be at war with each other because there's no notion of unity which holds it together um so I think the Trinity is there to I think one of the aspects of the trinity in the context of this conversation can help us understand that that is how especially in let's say even in the way that Dante presents it the notion of when we say God is love it's not just a Sentimental thing that we're saying we're saying that the source of reality is bound in this principle that draws us together but also doesn't reduce us to one because that's also one of the important aspects of Love is that if I love you I don't want to be I want you to exist as different from me right because if we collapse the difference between you and I then there's nothing to love anymore right so there's a there's a sense in which as I approach the thing I love I wanted both I both want to be United with it but I also wanted to have a certain distinction from myself or else it cannot be a source of a source that draws me and so the notion that those two those two aspects of love which is one the unity and multiplicity coexisting basically is the is the way that I I see it as helping to solve this a lot of these problems the other aspect what's important when you think of how Dante ascends is that before he let's say before he encounters the Trinity he encounters Christ and I and I really do think I really do think that Christ offers some Technical Solutions to some of the problems that we're dealing with so if you don't want to believe in Jesus Christ let's just at least start with the notion of the anointed or Christ the idea of the son of man which we find in Scripture because one of the problems we've been having and everybody's been talking about is how is it that how is it that these higher beings or that these distributed cognitions how is it that they exist or do they have Consciousness how do they have Consciousness is it possible how is it that their causal how do they hold together um and one of the things I think the ancients started to posit as a solution to that is something like Heavenly Man and you find that in the Bible when the image of the son of man but you find it also in early uh in early but actually in first century Jewish thinkers Philo of Alexander for example he talked about this idea Adam Cadman where Universal Man um and the reason why I think it's an important category because we often hear people say things like that they don't realize it but they'll say things you know like even like I'll use an example like Santa Claus like they'll say something like well Santa Claus doesn't exist it's just something humans came up with and I'm like okay humans came up with like who are these humans and is it one human like is it can you name them like can you find the people that came up with these things like can you find the people that came up with the structure of a family or the structure of a Nation like are you going to who are these humans so people said that it only exists because people say oh or people say something like gold only has value because we decide it does and like really who is this we that decide that gold has value right are you do you have the power to change that go ahead my friend like you you do that you change that you make that not true anymore go ahead and make sure that gold doesn't you know if it's just a completely subjective thing that we come up with then go ahead stop that make it stop right that's not how these things work there seems to be there seems to be driving uh Wills that are higher than our individual will that are managing these things but those Wills seem to be a reflection in just as the people are saying seems to be a kind of mirror of human of a human will it's a it's a human good that it's looking for it's not a it's not some random thing right so it's like you can imagine that someone that that the image of Santa Claus it's feeling a function that has some good whether you agree with it or not that has some function that is driving people to participate in that the value of gold is the same thing like the you can't just decide the value of gold seems to have some good it's aiming to you could then decide whether the good is is parasitic or whether it's where it has a more more to it than just that uh but it there's something driving that and so and and I do think that that's ultimately the notion of The Heavenly Man is helping us deal with so you could understand that positing of a of a man with a capital M that stands at the right hand of God and that rules over all things and so in even in the Bible if you know your New Testament and you start to think about it you can start to see that sometimes it seems that that's what Saint Paul or the or the the Bible is suggesting that is going on which is something like the Angels so these principalities that are above us these distributed cognitions that we encounter that we can see have agency over us they're about they are above us in sense that we're we're kind of subject to their causality but there's a manner in which you could say something like they are meant to serve man is meant to rule over them so you'll find texts like that in Saint Paul where it's like we are meant to rule with Christ like we're meant to rule with the angel we're meant to be in the Council of God ruling over these even over even over the Angels but I think it's also technically like just in terms of understanding how these these emanating group distributed cognitions happen is that they are ultimately the product of man with a capital M that they serve man or they don't serve man or you can find versions of it that are distorted and lead us into places where we don't where we didn't think was possible a good example is the genie is a good story for that right and so you have a higher level principality which appears to someone and then is at your service and the the principality says what do you want you can get whatever you want and it's like a test of virtue it's a test of where are you let's say on the scale of goods and so if you and then what you ask for you'll get but because you're not high enough on the left on the scale of goods you're going to get all the side effects that you weren't conscious enough or you weren't concentrated enough to get so you're going to get what you wanted and then all the side effects come with it so a good example of that is a Facebook that's probably one of the best examples to understand is that I really don't think that that Zuckerberg is a bad guy at the origin I think he's just naive he's very smart and naive and he's like we're gonna make this thing this community and it's going to have this these functionalities uh and he never really asked himself what good is it serving ultimately and he also there's a secret reason why it exists that they don't tell you which is ultimately to make money and so that's actually the secret reason behind let's say Facebook and so because of that no matter what functionality they put into it the only thing it wants from you is your attention that's all it wants it has your attention it runs it doesn't have your attention it doesn't and the way that it the reason why I want your attention because it monetizes your attention and so so then you have this thing which manifests itself a being that has agency over us that that has power over us ultimately but because it is not serving the proper good it becomes parasitic and it gets out of control and it starts to to manifest all these things that are that weren't intended in the first place but that were there if you had looked at the good that it was serving at the outset and so it has so you could say that Facebook is supposed it was supposed to serve man it was supposed to be an emergent an emergent uh say an emerging community that was there to serve the the needs of man but because it had a goal which was to make money just or that was like the first goal then everything else starts to get wobbly and then you realize that it ends up serving the darker aspects of ourselves it just ends up serving your passions you could say so it becomes distorted and then because you realize that the easiest way to get someone's attention or it is not to propose to them the good that's actually it hurts it hard it takes effort it's difficult it's to show you it's to make you angry it's to get you excited it's to it's to just stimulate the lower aspects of your your desires and that's how it'll get your your attention but then you can understand then you can understand like say Facebook that that this causal pattern that it is causal it actually has causes behavior in us and it brings us together towards purposes uh that it is at once it is that it is at once above us but it should or if it if you wanted it to work well it would have been in the service of man you could say like end now with a capital m um and I think that that at least in terms of the problem of understanding the consciousness of higher order beings I think it's probably Saint Maximus now becomes the the key to that again which is that we see these higher structures through human consciousness and that is completely the right way to see it that human consciousness becomes the like the the Crux of how these higher level beings exist and that is totally fine but it only works if we have a kind of distilled man right a a man which is I mean the best the image is The Heavenly Man a man that that is all that man can and should be ready it's the highest image of what man is and it gets pulled into one one place and he becomes like an image of what that is so and I think that that's what in the in the Old Testament the notion of the son of man was and so the son of man receives from God all power and authority over the world you see that in the Book of Daniel right so it's like the son of man descends from heaven and has all the power of God but is the the Heavenly image of man in the world and I think that I think that without that image and so you see it you see it then used in the the Renaissance new platonist they'll have versions of that right where they'll have Leonardo da Vinci's perfect man or you have different Notions of this ideal idealized man that that the Renaissance thinkers will try to bring into the conversation to make sense of the microcosm and macrocosm problem um but I do think that no matter how we we look at it that might be a really good place to look for us to be able to talk about the question of of distributed cognition or the manner in which principalities exist because they do have so right the image that Saint Paul talks about right so Saint Paul talks about these principalities and powers that are managing us and he says something like Christ is at this moment secretly ascending and dominate dominating over the principalities and Powers that is the image that was given to us of Man in Christ now this is where I'm going straight into the Christian the Christian idea that it it it does reveal to us the image of what the proper image of man which will rule properly over the principalities and that has to a certain extent to do with the problem that you're talking about yesterday in terms of the multiple Consciousness positions like the multiple eyes because what you realize is that the man the height and this is I think it's also a way it was scandalous when the story burst out into the world is that the man that is The Heavenly Man is the one who is willing to die is the one who is willing to let go of all these eye positions and that looks like die it's a it's a it's a self-sacrifice he's willing to sacrifice all these self little selves in order to enter into the ground of being that that John was talking about yesterday and so the so the the story of Christ like the image of Jesus on the cross so bothersome it's so weird you know you go into a church and of course we're used to it but it's like why do we have this dead guy looking at us right from the East where the sun rises it's like the origin he's the origin right so this guy on the cross is the origin um Saint Maximus says crazy things like he said things that sound crazy at the outfit but I think they're quite reasonable he says he says when Christ was on the cross he was creating the world yeah that's not gonna fit that in a scientific textbook but laughs the act the let's say if you can imagine and perfect ACT of self-sacrifice that act is the origin of the principalities right it's the or is the origin of the proper order of the world and that if if that happens then things lay themselves out under it in the right way so you could say in terms of your mystical experiences or the way that Mystics talk about it right and so they all these things that they use ego death or whatever all these types of terms that they use is that if you reach that point behind the eye positions you enter into a space which both recognizes that none of these positions have existence in themselves but that they all have existence because they are held together in this place of uh this place which in some ways is beyond particular care but is like the source of all care you could say right it's like it's it's beyond a particular love but it's the source of all loves um and so I I really do I really do believe that the story of Jesus if we start to think of it even in terms of the conversations we're having we'll be able to reveal some things about why the story looks the way it does because it's a it's a it's a very strange and it's a very strange story you think like why is it that that story and so even as a secular materialist it's like why did that story become the backbone of Western thinking why did that story become the backbone of Western thinking on morality because we and even like I think most people today will believe something like that self-sacrifice has value it's like really I mean okay but why like why why do you think that or why do you think that self-sacrifice has a has a causal causes the world to exist properly and I've been thinking about about that a lot in terms of trying to understand how we also categorize things and and I mentioned this with it but I want to go just before I end I want to go through it because I want you to see that I know it's hard let's speak for people that are if they use to the Christian language and and it's hard because sometimes you just hear the story and you have this barrier it's I I get it but if if for something to exist as one the multiple aspects of that thing whatever it is because they do all they could also exist in other ways they have millions of other ways in which they could exist right they could have other functions other they have to give themselves to the one okay so of course that you remember what I said you could say it happens through men that's totally fine I'm not saying that the parts of the glass have this will that they're giving up their will and that they're moving towards the unity of the glass like I'm not saying that but if that's how you want to understand that's also fine whatever I'm just trying to help understand that there's an there's a need for idiosyncrasy to be sacrificed towards the whole and that is how things actually cohere into one so self-sacrifice is at the origin of the unity in things and there's also a manner in which the one also has to give itself to the many because nothing is perfect you have to right so it's like if I imagine the form of the glass almost in the platonics it's the perfect glass if there has to be a kind of flexibility to let multiplicity be possible Right to let the glass exist make of one miss out of wood or out of glass out of metal have different sizes there has to be a kind of a kind of giving up of the purity of of the one so that the Manny can exist this is of course something if you in any team or in any group you'll definitely at some point see that there's a there can be the goal of the team or the goal of whatever it is we're doing and that will be that which draws us together we're going to give our idiosyncrasies to that right so if I'm if I'm playing a sport if I'm playing basketball I'm not hanging out with my girlfriend I'm not like doing other things I am giving away I'm sacrificing all these aspects of me in order to give myself to this Unity that I'm participating in so I'm joined together with others I'm I'm I'm doing it in love towards a good and so it's a there's a sacrificial aspect to that but there's also a manner in which the team that I'm participating in also has to give itself to the players it has to it has to kind of say give itself in love to the players and care about even the players The Players let's say idiosyncrasies or the things about the players which don't totally fit I have to I have to have give some mercy towards that or else because nobody is a perfect basketball player nobody is just a basketball player there will be that messiness and so I I have to the the one has to give itself to the many and the many have to give itself to the one for for that to exist and that's what I think I think that that's one of the things I think that Christ let's say reveals in his story and I think that's probably also why after Christ after the story of Christ the sacrificial system ends pretty much everywhere like the actual physicals you know scapegoat sacrifices and all these types of of physical ritualized sacrifice they they all tend to kind of Peter out because he's revealing a different mode of of sacrifice which is actually more primordial to how things work and that and it's the that's actually it's like actually self-sacrifice is the way so if you want your family to bind together you can do it with a black sheep it works by the way so you can have a member of your family that's a black sheep and you can just put all the blame on them whatever problems your family has it's their fault whatever whatever issue they have and you'll find unity in blaming the black sheep it'll work I'm telling it it's like it's their fault and now we love each other more because we know it's their fault right and you see it it's happening right now like all the scapegoating it's it's crazy sadly coming back again and then what Christ reveals is that no actually the proper mode of sacrifice is self-sacrifice so if you want your family to cohere and you're a father you have to give yourself to the whole and if you do that it has a it's much more powerful and will create much more Unity than the scapegoat part and then the same for the group the group it's like it's actually if I sacrifice my idiosyncrasy towards this common good then I it's the best way for Unity and multiplicity to coexist um and so I so I hopefully I've been I'm going over my time sorry so hopefully this is just the thought that I've had regarding Dante and the notion of the good but also related to the problem even categorization and how higher beings can be said to exist uh and not because we've been struggling for for months now everybody's struggling about talking about Edgar gors and all these different terms they're trying to talk about to talk to to discuss how these higher patterns are causal um and I really do think that the notion of man or distilled man is the way to that it goes through that it's like a filter it's like the the notion of man is this fault is this filter that makes these principalities uh causal on us kind of accept it implicitly because we recognize that they serve the good even if we're wrong we recognize that they serve the good of man uh and even if we like I said even if we're off on that it's still that because in Dante all the bad things you do are also driven by love it's just distorted right it's like if if you become a becoming a drug addict is love love is what makes you become a drug addict right love is what makes you become become uh anything like cheat on your wife or whatever bad thing that you're going to do it's always love towards a perceived good that drives you towards it and you can get it wrong but it's still the same structure so anyways hopefully that was helpful a little bit in the discussion I wasn't too rambly because I was doing trying to bring it together and uh yeah thanks you for your attention thank you
