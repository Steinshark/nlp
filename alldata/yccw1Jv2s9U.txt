it's a weird moment when you do this because like we let's just say you're going to come up with a prediction of the future and it's not so bright there's a weird moment of satisfaction you have when you're like aha i was right and then you're like oh no i was right no it's like here come the terminators i knew it i knew it great wonderful this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] so hello everybody i am sitting here with neil degrade neil degrade is a musician he is uh the uh the headliner for a band called dirt poor robbins but he's also done so much in music world written scores for movies for different shows he's been in several bands and he's also become uh quite a participant in the symbolic world he is in contact with a lot of people that are kind of swirling around the videos i've been in discussion with him for several uh for like years now or like over a year over a year now and we're also looking at doing some projects together so i'm really excited to have him on the the show mostly to talk about how it is that artists can predict the future oh this is where i talk i could okay if i was gonna predict in the future i could have predicted that oh that's a good setup i like that uh this is a great topic um i guess i i gotta give you a little background yeah so i i was born into a family of entertainers and musicians so both sides of my family pretty much across the board all musical all entertainers most in many professional at one point uh really funny thing i like to tell people is that my i found my parents my parents marriage certificate and on the marriage certificate back then you like in the 60s you had to put your parents occupation so my dad's father he was a radio announcer entertainer and my mom's father was a radio announcer entertainer so there was like a part of like my i think i was genetically bred to be on the radio and just missed like stepped out of the stable and missed my calling so uh but it was a family of entertainers and so there was no question that i was i was going to learn music it was going to be forced on me whether i liked it or not and it turned out that i really liked it so um my dad used to bring home records from the radio station and he the first one i ever get i think really explains what we're doing the best because he brought home two records for me and my brother to pick from one was kiss and the other one was queen it was news of the world and my brother picked kiss and you know if you listen to kiss and what they've stated their goal was gene simmons says like we weren't trying to be the beatles like every other band we wanted to be coca-cola and that's like totally my brother he's like brilliant with marketing and he's had an incredible career with that and he's kind of went off that way and i picked queen uh which you know queen i think was trying to be an opera or a movie and so that would like that just blew my tiny mind and the artwork on that record was like this isaac asimov take where there was this you know giant robot i guess we could pull this up at the toi i'm saying this um but you know had was killing like the members of the band and it like really tripped my little five-year-old mind out five years old yeah man oh dude yeah that really just that that was it for me that ruined me as far as being able to do anything normal with music i was it's all going to be theatrical and cinematic from that point on yeah and that's the an interesting aspect of your work which you know your band your poor robin's there really is a storytelling aspect to the band there's like almost like you said an operatic there's some nostalgia there's something melodramatic about the way that things are presented um and so i can really i didn't i wouldn't have thought right away queen but when you say it i'm like yeah that's that makes a lot of sense that well there are definitely other influences in there so kate is really the band is myself and my wife and we've used a lot of other incredible musicians and people play with us over the years but kate and i met uh when i was in my early 20s and she is really the other half of the band she she kind of taught me i would say how to write lyrics uh she was already she already had a music career going we met she was younger than me but i was this really poor guy living in providence rhode island and there was a musical that was auditioning in town it was supposed to be going to broadway and some people showed me some examples of it i thought it was incredible but i had like zero interest in being in a musical so i did not want to audition but i was hitching a ride with my friends and they said they would drop me off where i wanted to go if i would just audition with them which was strange so the audition was really weird because generally it's like you know you see these in movies where there's this panel yeah many people watching and it that was there but it was also in an old church in new england so everybody waiting to audition was still in the was in the audience so you're auditioning in front of all these other people which i didn't care about because i didn't plan on doing a musical there was one part left and they were auditioning the mail lead and they were like going nationwide trying to find this guy well i got up to audition and i decided my job was going to be to make my friends laugh and it somehow translated as like confidence and composure and stage presence and i had very little experience in musicals and so the next day i get a call and they're like hey listen congratulations you got the part and i was like oh that's so nice i don't want the part though like you know i'm sure you've got there were a lot of people there that were great i'm sure you've got them there and then and so i turned it down and then the writer of the musical called me back and uh his name was enrico garzali he was really interesting guy um but he started he started explaining to me a very strange angle as why i should do this he's like i cast you because you go perfectly with the girl we cast for the lead he said you guys are going to want to you're going to want to marry this girl 100 and i think there's going to be incredible chemistry and then like and she was from los angeles she auditioned out on the west coast and uh i was like well maybe i could show up to a couple rehearsals so i i said yes and i showed up and the first meeting i had with kate where we had to sing is she just you know got in front of me and her part in this duet went first and she started to sing and i never heard anything like this like coming out of someone's mouth three feet you know it's really uncomfortable to have someone staring you in the eyes with like complete confidence in just singing at you and she it sounded so amazing i was like i am in way over my head i am doomed here and so anyway you're like i'm gonna marry her that's how he was so right he was so right we got uh we got married and we instantly started writing she was a singer-songwriter and i was always in collaborations and bands and she was like a wordsmith and so she instantly like turned my brain on to like that potential music because i was one of like those typical dudes that was interested in melody and music but i was just like lyrics were just in the background of the song for me and she like really gave me a love for that so that's that's how our like really our band got started in our marriage and our kids and so it's kind of everything that's very fascinating yeah that's weird one of the things that that bring us here is because your last album uh is kind of causing a stir in the symbolic world world you would say because that you wrote it what in 2018 or you came out and when did you write you write it okay so i guess there's other background required is that all of our albums all of our you know the last 10 years have been concept albums where i'll write a story and then i will record i'll write down the bullet points of that story in the most important moments and then i'll write songs for those so it's a really um i really think art flourishes when i have structure for me like when i know and i have an assignment and a boundary to play within i will write within those boundaries so i write the story and then we fill in the blanks with the song so we were wrapping up a record called the raven locks in 2017-2018 uh which was you know one of the things about movies and music a lot of times it's written long before you ever record it so the raven locks was wrapping up and i needed a new story so 2018 rolled around and this was a weird way like to come up with an idea for record so you're familiar with airbnb where you rent houses you know and travel so we had rented a house on the gulf coast of florida to go on a vacation but right when we were about to leave for the vacation like a red tide had taken over and they weren't letting people in the beach where the house was and you know they were evacuating there were dead fish everywhere it was horrible and so i was like of course this you know i'm not going to be renting this house so it sounded like a nightmare so you know i messaged the guy i was like of course you know we're gonna need to get out this he's like oh that's fine you know you can but he's not gonna give us our money back and i was like oh gee that's an interesting turn of events so i looked into the airbnb's policy on like why you could cancel and so i'm as i'm scanning through one of the things was a pandemic and i was like i hadn't really thought about a pandemic our previous story because we write light-hearted stuff had to do with cholera a little bit so i knew a little bit about how these things function but as i was starting to read about what made something qualify as a pandemic it the story like hit me and i was like oh my gosh like do you really like there's a i've had this concern that our society we're already like the social fabric is disintegrating and people are already pushing for a part and if there was just some kind of like even mild uh pandemic like what would be the implications of that so i just started writing a story about that idea so yeah 2020 rolled around and we had released almost we released our records and chunks almost like a pulp thing um where we were releasing an eps and everything but the last ep had come out but it was weird because like there were things that were happening directly in the headlines that we were singing about and you know it is what it is i didn't you know wasn't trying to predict a pandemic i was just paying attention to the world and like i generally write and deal with subjects that are troubling me because i don't i think i make music and i've never been able to stop myself making music because it's how i stay sane so i like i i use art to kind of like ground me and explore the story because it's easier for me to see how something fits together when it all comes together as a concept within art and music than it is to just abstractly just imagine what the world's actually working like so that was where dead horse came from so in dead horse you have this story it's all but there's also not just a pandemic there's this whole idea of kind of the edge of the world how all of this is is is related to to and there's not just the pandemic but also the reaction to the pandemic and this idea of a world that is kind of shut down and and how this like kind of this prison of i don't know how can i say this like this prison that makes you safe but then also also takes everything away from you at the same time yeah so yeah so what i did is i riffed on the idea of quarantine or a society that was riddled with series of quarantines for multiple reasons um from even reasons of personality where ideologies were too different and people couldn't hear couldn't hear things they didn't like anymore they were too fragile and also the idea that people just saw everybody became a germaphobe and was afraid of what everybody else presented to them and the danger that presented and also how companies would benefit from that and how all the new technology would benefit from that so the story actually is this weird kind of like i would say like a rip van winkle structure where um the characters find the means to try to go into the future to escape what's happening um so it starts out in dead horse alaska which is the namesake of the record and dead horse alaska is in prudent bay in the north edge of the world and that's where the alaskan pipeline begins so the story starts when the alaskan pipeline is turned on and it's this power and i you know i uh mythologized it so they i i talk about that within the story as if they found like under some beast at the bottom of the ocean and what were the implications of that thing and what were the desires of that beast so um as we moved into dead horse you know they go into the future and when they wake up a hundred years later i'm skipping really quickly just to get to the point of um what you've asked and that is that they wake up into a world that's the world we live in now but it's accelerated so this pattern of spreading out and everything's on the grid and everything's distanced and people are you know well sadly like they are now we're communicating each other through a little window like before we started i picked like the best angle in here and i put like my favorite gear in the shot and so like gearheads would see it and like you know all like i'm kind of breaking the wall but this isn't what my life looks like i mean there's other angles of this trailer where i've pushed all the junk that i was working on yeah yeah it's like it was kind of a riff on some of these ideas and what that would do to uh personalities and people and also how technology would try to solve that yeah yeah yeah um so maybe we can look at some of the songs because one of the things that i want to kind of bring about uh is this idea of pattern or pattern intuition and so you know in 2019 i said i i told people like get ready for 2020 because it goes to me crazy and then some people later said oh jonathan predicted the future i'm like i didn't predict the future it's like it's it you know if you see a vase tipping on the side of a table and you then you tell people to watch out because it's falling it's different and i think that i mean obviously that's a simplified version but i think there are some people that have an intuition about patterns and so as you kind of look at the pattern then you talk about them um even without knowing it you you can end up doing something like predict the future without trying to do that explicitly it's just this attention attention to the world attention to patterns and then and then kind of telling a story that ends up formulating this the to say that uh what's going on even if it's implicit and it's not completely logical and understood yet yeah i mean i guess before we dig into the story a little more that's really worth mentioning so when we first got a record deal we were making music independently i was just making stuff on a computer at home and it just started selling and i just quit my job and i was like oh my gosh this is this is going really well and we did the next thing you do is we try to find a record label we had interest and the problem with the record label was that they they need to make money and so what we were doing isn't like the most obvious way to make money um so there was this like oh they look at they see talent or they see you know like um they see something that's marketable and then they try to package it within some kind of popular form so there was this real push towards pop and so my problem i always had when i was interacting with pop is i think i made my worst stuff because there's this tendency just to copy what everybody else is doing like you know it's good when it fits the pattern but you don't understand the pattern necessarily so simultaneously there was this other thing happening where um it was kind of where i started seeing the world symbolically and i didn't know it was a good way to see the world or the right way to see the world i just knew there was power in it when it came to writing so like what we talked about you know with this oil and i personified the you know energy in the story or you could take cancer culture and you could give it some kind of monstrous description and describe you know come come up with some analogous ways that that monster might do the same thing i realized there was so much it was so much more impactful when i would take the patterns i was seeing and i would give them a will and an intelligence um and so that changed things and also the other side of the change things is where we realized where we were going to be positioned as artists is that it was also it takes place within a world that has a beginning middle and an end and we as we're writing we found it was a way better sweet spot for us to imagine that this was the end um like it was that things were coming to a close and the pattern was about you know something new was ahead so when once i started looking at this world in these in in these symbolic patterns and like really starting to see monsters in like demons and things whether they were there or not i didn't know it just it suddenly it was like i had no end to the ideas anymore it wasn't like i was trying to find an idea for a pop song it was like i have more ideas right now than i know what to write about it was changing the way i was looking out out of the window simultaneously i was obsessed with genesis and the other part i felt was missing from the world was losing sight of what human nature was and why it was there and i got obsessed with the story of the garden of eden because it was such an incredible description of like these these weird desires for perfection or to be divine or to be royal that we have and that things shouldn't go wrong and it just it started to explain that in the story so i always keep that story in mind when it comes to like how consciousness developed and that interpretation of it is i throw that over everything whether people like it or not like it's that yeah but it doesn't necessarily because you you've internalized it it doesn't necessarily appear that way this is one of the things too that even in the discussion with my brother matters sometimes uh sometimes we would say some we would think like oh that's too obvious like it's too obvious if we say something this way or if we say it this way it's too obvious then you realize no it's not it's actually it's actually not you see the connection like if you're using analogies you think that it's the same as something else but but people don't necessarily notice it and so if you if you take the story of the garden and you superimpose it over another event yeah most people won't see that it's the story of the garden like they'll just see that it has this amazing coherence to it or this strange intuitive coherence to it yeah and people are so i think they're just we're sitting on top of so many things we didn't invent we're sitting on top of so many things we used to have to do ourself we're so detached from how we get our food and how even the the car we drive is operates or how it's built we can't repair it i can't fix the computer i'm using we're sitting on top of all this stuff that just um we we don't we start to reason as if that's the actual starting point for reality and we all kinds of errors are being made everywhere where uh even especially in the political spheres when you listen to the different ends of the political narrative it's like it's totally detached from the the substructure of what it what being is itself what it means to be a person in this world it's just it seems so inorganic now it's starting to it causes like a little bit of panic in me when i realize like how people see themselves and what they think we are sometimes and so really the the record at the end of the day is a discussion of like your nature and what you're ignoring i didn't again that wasn't my intention but when i look back at it it's like trying to drive the bottom of why you do what you do and why you want what you want because we don't question those things nearly enough all right so i want to look at some of the songs right now because i think because we've been talking about it abstractly but people are gonna are going to to see right away especially people that have been following this channel are going to kind of see the patterns pop out um and so did you have a song you wanted us to start with particularly um okay so i well i guess this is worth mentioning i i hijacked um jonathan's uh symbolic world intro with uh a song and the song is called saints one so you've already heard the introduction to that song and uh i guess we could start there because i think that's an interesting one because right after i released that um i just thought it was my idea for a story but then like tim cook you know from apple came out uh that's his name right tim yeah tim cook yeah yeah he like literally just outlined the idea like just straight i was like oh okay i was it's a weird moment when you do this because like we let's just say you're gonna come up with a prediction of the future and it's not so bright there's a weird moment of satisfaction you have when you're like aha i was right and then you're like oh no i was right no it's like here come the terminators i knew it i knew it great wonderful um all right and so let me read some of the some of the uh so tell me the concept of the song first of all and then we can look at some of the actual lyrics okay the song is interesting because it it intentionally steals christian imagery of the saints and redemption and absolution but it's being used in a pattern to advertise this technology that is supposed to solve your felt needs so so the the needs that people are trying to solve now um are generally this idea and like you know tim cook says it in his speech that like like there's it's immoral to despair or it's unethical to despair and this is this way that technology companies look at you or even anybody selling a product to you is this is here to make you feel better about yourself feel better about life um you know to give to take you one farther step down that red carpet towards your throne and so what happens is is this this abandoned structure in the world where there's like people used to venerate saints and they decide to well they come up with an acronym s-a-i-n-t-s and it describes the technology and acronyms are so wonderful like they're so acronyms are like one of the diseases of the modern world are yeah are these acronyms well and so part you talk about this in your channel but people can't help so when a powerful thing gets abandoned you know people will pick it up and use it for whatever they whatever they can they won't understand the purpose of it so they'll abuse it so in this song it's basically this world where everybody's detached and so fragile and separated from connection they're like well we're not going to get them back together with people that doesn't work so we're going to create this ai this embodied technology that's going to go and it's going to solve their felt needs it's going to oprah winfrey their self-esteem and uh and so that's what the saint saints is and so this song is like they're opening ceremonies for the revealing of this technology um so that's it's it's their propaganda is how i would see it in the story right exactly all right so here we [Music] you go up with an ache for something to set you apart strip the scales from your heart a hostage tied up by its nature that can't happen sheathing its claws [Music] redemption has come [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] numbers [Music] [Applause] so i mean it's pretty wonderful to see like there's the imagery is is really powerful first of all this idea of uh this idea of you want to be special you want to be set you apart and it's a great it's a great way of saying it because it actually that's what being holy is right when you say something is holy we say it's set apart and so you have this desire to be holy and to strip the scale from your heart to remove those outer garments you know and get to the to the middle but then then you realize that it's this factitious factitious thing that they're presenting and it's also this idea i love how it's like i want to all of a sudden this idea of when the saints go marching in and says i want to be in their number and then it talks about the light begins to shine all of a sudden you realize this weird kind of uh 666 image right of this of this total system that will identify you that will name you that will shine its light on you you know and make it impossible for you to to hide like you said to hide in any form of negativity it's like we're going to make you happy by whatever it means necessary right and the ned flanders that that simpsons episode with uh ned flanders like there's this simpson episode like halloween episode where ned flanders takes over the the world and he has re-education seminars where everybody has to say that everything's okay and they they force them into smiles like they pull hooks their their their lips up into smiles that's exactly it that's exactly it well because i mean the the reality is that these narratives are detached from how things really work and so the everything every person who doesn't fit the narrative is is evidence against it so that's why you have to force conformity because the reality won't conform to this idea so you have to use muscle it's like the you know there's an autopilot's heading in a different way and you you don't want to go there and so you have to muscle up and see how long you can hold the wheel going in a different direction and so that's what happens in these this totalizing system is that it just it doesn't work people break from the inside out even if they you know can't get at each other yeah exactly and it's you can see it now because it's creating it's creating these weird side effects that they they i guess they probably haven't planned for and now they're constantly trying to to patch over and to compensate and you know to actually at this while they want to kind of include everybody to make everybody part of this total system then they nonetheless end up having this strange desire to totally exclude those that don't want to be in the system you know that's the problem right that is that that's the problem with this kind of system is that because it presents itself as this totalizing system then those who don't want to be in the system are they're not human or they're barely human they're you know they're they they don't have a place well you can't have equity if you're around other people either like so the problem is the more things you equalize the more the things that can never be equalized um exaggerate it's just it's just what happens i mean like one of the jokes i make with people is like a world that's trying to let's just say men and women are all the same is a world that also suddenly it's like cool to have a beard and it's like well why did that happen you know should we all be clean-shaven um but also there's um yeah there's this well the notion is so like just thinking down this idea is that if you don't deal with the problems in there in the traditional places we dealt with problems now you have to so you don't know where the problem lies and so everybody's a problem so yeah so you have to treat everybody as an equal offender of being diseased as a being a uh potential a potential insurrectionist you want to say it that way like that everybody's a problem so everybody has to get away from each other and uh that's the problem with that that system is the end result is if you really try to stick to it eventually you have to isolate everyone from each other to actually have equal because otherwise you're going to just observe inequalities that exist through any difference anytime your insight on that is so good because it's it's almost happening kind of on its own in the sense that i don't i can't imagine that that some people maybe like there are people that evil that are sitting around and thinking we need to isolate everybody from each other as much as possible for our system to function it almost happens organically out of the necessities of their desires which is like they because they want this this thing this kind of they want everybody to be included the only way they can do it like you said is to actually limit real interactions between people because in those real interactions hierarchies will appear inevitably like you can't avoid it so now there's still one of the things they realize with the technology that there is too much individual variation in between people so they they do almost like what you do when you try to hack a pop song is where you try to find this the commonalities and like you try to come up with something universal i think a really funny version of that is on the show lost is there this band called drive shaft and their one hit song was called you all everybody and it's like the most generic like you who does that not include you all everybody and i just thought that was a really perfect you know idea of like when you try to hit the lowest common denominator so they can't properly produce an intelligence that is reactive enough to everybody with their traditional means so they outsource this idea to the collective knowledge and like the you know a samara uh summer a summarizing look at all of the books that have been produced and the songs and so the computer just collects everything and tries to understand it that way so it just looks at what everybody how everybody's already defined things and then uses those definitions and adapts so um in the story there is a group that's kind of like a knights templar group that you know that protects the holy grail and indiana jones would be the way most people know about that idea but there's this group that sort of hates this technology and they're they're they're sort of like vanguarding this and so they decide to take it down or they try to take it down or break it by using ambiguity that's naturally in language so they they find the ideal word to mess with to break the technology and that word is heart because the heart is um well it's the center it's an actual organ in your body and it's almost the same way in every language every language uses this the same way and uh but it has to do with affections it has to do with things and so they realize the best way to break the system and break the program is to mess with the idea of the heart and so that then you know all hell breaks loose in my story once this once this bug is introduced hmm all right so second song we wanted to look at it's called it tore your heart out and here you really get this you really get this vision which is which is powerful so i'll read a little bit of it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] from [Music] is why all right well gee this one was this one was freaky because i had recorded it and i hadn't i was just about to release it and it was i think was like march 13th or march 15th and then it was like oh we're all locked down in our homes and i was like oh gee this is a problem and i so i was looking at it and i was like oh man well at least i had my head on straight is what i thought and i felt like i had some kind of well way to look at what was happening outside of just you know i did i never believed you know 15 days to flatten the curve i just it never never even occurred to me that that was what was going to happen yeah you're like this there's no way there was just no way it was like because like like you were saying i don't you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to realize where the opportunity lies in any given situation like it you don't need a group of people planning behind closed doors to plot against you because people are just going to go where the money is and so money is going to go to the world that can a world that's isolated so you know zoom went through the roof and uh you know amazon of course all these companies really benefit from this and there's incentive for them to just keep making it easier and easier for us to live like this so i did i wasn't fooled by that for a second but you know if i was going to break that down a little bit what's interesting to me is i use this imagery as they're locked alone in their lavish homes with pets and wigs and their bloated thrones so that's the idea such a great image well there's so much there's so much to dissect in that in that sentence well everybody's gonna become a fop you know it's like if you don't know what a fop is just you know go back and look at the you know uh the signing of the declaration of independence and wonder why these grown men were wearing white wigs and you know or watch mozart and you can find out about that turkish fashion movement but so i mean with your filters and all the things people use it's like yeah i have this really controlled view and like oh man like this guy's life is created studio is awesome except for the mess over there and uh so that was the thing is like i just envisioned like if you keep people in a place where the only time they see other people is through a little lens it's they're they're going to spend all of their resources and time into that window yeah um and so you know i just thinking about that and i realized other things about it once i started living in that world it's like you know i'm in public and the only time i'm in public no one my identity is veiled so when i'm actually with a person my identity is failed but then when i'm with you um it's not only am i not i'm it's my full identity it's a hyper identity because i'm looking in a mirror you know i put it over here so i'd have to do this to look at myself but you're looking in a mirror yeah while you're talking to someone else everyone yourself like no the proper psychological studies have not been done on what the impact of that would be yeah talking to someone but seeing yourself at the same time man it's a horrible horrible idea it's like there should be a fairy tale about it but there's something about this this paragraph which it's just so powerful in the sense that so the name of the song is it tore your heart out and that's the the chorus and so if you tear someone's heart out if you tear the heart out of something that is the center if you tear the middle out of this out of it then what you're describing is is such a powerful kind of modern version of what that would look like first of all this idea of the the the suburban uh hell for the living dead so the suburbs are are not the city they're this ambiguous like margin of the city where everything becomes this like you know i've talked about this before right everything gets spread out and there's no center there's no reason besides just kind of being this these these independent points on a map basically on the grid uh this like spread over a piece of toast kind of and so that is that is a form of living death because you're there but you can't see the reason there you can't understand why you live next to these people right there's nothing bringing you together besides just the factuality of just being in a line of people on a street you know and then this so then being alone obviously but also being uh the idea of pets and wigs it's such a great image because it has to do with the hair right it has to do with the extremities and these dead things because this animal this animal part of us like it's also talking about kind of being stuck alone with your desires in the sense that it's like you're there and you you you don't have communion so you end up also going into uh you're you're in the danger of falling into idiosyncrasy right right and that's what the flop-ish aspect of it too is like going into these weird idiosyncratic uh aspects of what it means to be to be human and then coming coming coming to it then to say pure devotion to your skin which what ends up being what this is all about like this this outer is this being stuck in this outer periphery alone in this uh in the in the in the in the periphery in the uh the edge of the wheel let's say you're stuck on the edge of the wheel and then you then you compare it to the opposite which is you flee communion right which is where you find the heart and then the cup is void and it's just a perfect such a perfect thing it's crazy like i said that you wrote that i mean i guess you could intuit that like even if there wasn't like a plague that happened that this was already going on it was already going on yeah that's it i'm like dealing head on with something i just it's just where things were going that's that's the trajectory of things it's like what you're doing is that same thing you do on the sats and they're like they give you seven numbers and the next three are blank and you have to figure out the pattern right and obviously there's more factors in life than just this number sequence but it's the same thing it's like yeah like this is where we're going this is what all the technology is allowing us to do people are tough people are a problem as long as people define their life as going wrong anytime they have any kind of struggle or that like you know god's favor has left them if anything's difficult you're that's the man i can sell that person anything right so that's part of the problem with this is that the idea would it tore your heart out um you know because you didn't understand why you want what you wanted yeah you know so i met someone uh the other day well someone actually knew before this but they had lost their sense of smell and taste from this you know this covered flu thing going around so they um they were like they're in perfect shape it was so so silly they said this they're like you would think i would lose more weight since i can't taste my food and i was like no you have to swallow your food like it's weird like nobody thinks about this anymore like swallowing is the is more important than the foods taste at the end of the day because go to your favorite restaurant like just if they ever let you do this but you'll never do it but go eat order your favorite thing and chew it up and spit it in a bucket and tell me how good of a time you had yeah so there are things in life that are fat that take longer to develop than meals that where if you didn't swallow your food at the end like there might be you know one of the things i might realize about myself is one day i might look back and like i didn't have grandkids and i might feel like i didn't swallow life like that might hit me different you know as i as i'm older and so now i have kids but um there's also other weird things like you know you when you get hurt like people don't understand like even what's going on inside of them because they think it's all made up but you know if you stub your toe on an object you you have a weird thing to do where instantly you you assign a will to that object that hit you it's like it did it on purpose you want to kick it back yeah yeah you have to stop yourself from destroying yourself because that's that weird vengeance narrative we have that only destroys us but also at the same time you people don't recognize when they're hurt they feel isolated they like you boom you zoom out from the rest of the world and you're alone and they don't understand suffering and loneliness go hand in hand so they there's this lack of understanding of what's really going on in our nature and we we don't question enough i think that garden of eden story is so great because you know i read uh hymns in paradise and when i read him the paradise um you know i think i told you this and i ended up writing a song on this record about it it was this idea that was like oh it was like i remembered something i was trying to remember my whole life like or you know reminded me of something i was trying to remember and there is this sense of like we're you know we have this evolution story going around and i'm not anti-evolution at all but i i don't think the story says enough because there are all kinds of desires we have for paradise and for perfection and for completeness and for things to never go wrong that just don't make any sense where these squishy animals running around and then i read the story and suddenly it's like yeah we're like like like mom died in the beginning of the disney princess story and we're trying to solve that problem and so people don't know why they want what they want and if they really believe that you know anytime something isn't going their way that that's wrong right that i again you could sell them anything so then bring it to the next song that i wanted to look at uh it's called but never a key and then this song really looks at the problem or let's say the problem that the opportunity of safety gives and like this the the problem that we have right now which is to see safety as the ultimate value and to see this this kind of safety and pleasure too like this kind of idea that if you're safe you can can have your little pleasures and and and i hear even the politicians talk about that it's drives me insane like here in quebec you know they're like well it'll be okay you know you can just you can have naps and you can watch tv and you can play video games and it's like you know you can get the rest that you've always wanted right you've always wanted this so it's like you can you can get that nice little pleasant uh life that you that you wish for uh so let me read a little bit from this [Music] your tragedy and i'm sure that they won't be done till they fenced off the ledges and rounded the edges of all that goes wrong [Music] your maze is i'm sorry you'll never be free if all that you see [Music] is [Music] that you chose all but never a case [Music] never yeah it's awesome there it is yeah it's such a it's such an amazing i mean it's really amazing to see that you wrote this you know several years ago yeah i mean people came out in 2019 yeah so i mean and but it's also not that long ago that it was right on the edge of the pattern like it was riding the edge of the pattern so that when things started to happen it was like it was that thing in that thing ahead of you that was telling you to watch out that you didn't listen to you know when you should have yeah no i cried when i wrote that too it's so sappy but like i this thing hits me every once in a while where like you condense something into what feels like the right idea and it's it's like you know i think something's profound when it's like you saw it but you didn't have the words for it and then someone comes up and they say it in like a real concise way and you're like the light bulb goes off but not because you weren't already seeing it you were seeing it so like when i wrote this it just hit me i was like because i mean this obviously this all these ideas are present beforehand because um you know again like this like everybody is just so concerned about it being in a pleasured state and there's so many things on tap that can like you can just satiate so many different things without any hesitation um and so when i wrote this song it's like yeah i mean this is this is what's happening people are going to people are going to accept a cage that's what's that's where we're head if something doesn't happen it's different this is what's going to happen yeah i mean it's already there it's there right now i would say it's just like it's like maybe we have the sense that it's going to stop but it could get worse it could get a lot worse it could get a lot worse so daniel keys wrote this song this story called flowers for algernon and he wrote the story based upon experience he had with a real life student who had a brain injury who he was teaching to read again and then they went away for summer break and the student came back and the student had forgotten everything and he was devastated he went and wrote this the story flowers for algernon if you haven't read it uh i would check it out really great book um it's funny that it's called but never a key and his last name is keys but um so one of the things they tried to do when he went to publish it is everybody was like oh what a great story what a cool sci-fi story um yeah just make the ending happy and we'll run with this and he refused and finally someone published it and it was like a pulitzer prize winner and then they wanted to make it into a film in hollywood i think the film's called charlie and uh they're like yeah we're just gonna make it have a happy ending and he's like no it's not real if it has a happy ending so he wouldn't sell it until they made it his way and uh so the whole idea here is that saying this this idea of the devouring mother that you know like okay kids had seven cupcakes but like here comes the eighth and he wants it and you can't say no because you think your job is to keep everybody like you sinned against someone if they are upset with you um so that's the whole idea is like we're gonna you know you just look at the if you're old enough like uh so you can see that there used to be not not used to be rails on certain things and they didn't force you to wear seat belts and some of this is good but also like everything's getting padded out there yeah yeah yeah i love it so they fenced off the ledges and rounded the hedges yeah yeah right so that's it's just what's happening it's like that's you know that's too if you're in like politics you've got to look for the sharp pointy objects sitting out there that are still left so you have a purpose yeah right and there's something from somebody something like you said it's already there so like i i think i might have told the story on the channel before but i one of the things that when i was when my kids were younger and we go to the park there's this one moment that hit me like it just hit me so hard i saw there were these children and this child was playing in the park the child starts running and then the mother says or who's the father i don't remember if it was a man or woman says don't run you'll fall in a park no i was like what did you just tell your child not to run because they will fall that is the most insane thing i've ever heard yeah oh like it's grass it's like that's fine to fall on grass that's where you do fall yeah exactly right they better learn to fall there um all right so last song i wanted to look at all right obviously it's a perfect song to also to finish off our analysis uh it's called no land beyond and here's part of it [Music] [Applause] if you don't know of the language [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is when the world is upside down follow the fool for solid ground that's awesome it's a very pejoring line very in line but it's but it's great because it also talks about this idea that that this problem of not knowing the language or the language falling apart like to say the sacred language falling apart and then people not being able to recognize the patterns and then at that moment you know it it creates this madness because people don't know what's going on they they can't recognize you know the world's falling apart but they don't understand why they can't see it if they could only they only knew the language then they would notice that this is part of the story and this is where we are it would give them some some some strange comfort to be able to at least realize what's going on to to to to limit this side effects or limit the adverse effects of being in this pattern um and then of course you know at that moment like you said there's only one last the last thing left to do so one of the thing is it's like so what i saw this part of the song as i did it as a canon because these are like things i think that are swirling around right now like these these are problems that are swirling around right now and every once in a while there's this like there's this one little light that pops up and there's so many stories that just seem so politically driven and and the world is filled with so much mush that it's like people don't understand the structure of reality or how to see it because it's again we're sitting on top of something so inorganic and uh so but the the fool in there is like the is this idea i tell a story it's like if you're ever like stuck and you've run out of ideas and and you need to make a decision and nobody has an idea you look for the most foolish person in the group and you get them drunk and you listen to them it's it's this idea like when like you know because everything's so everything's so counterintuitive that it's like oh the person who's is the anomaly who's saying the thing that doesn't fit the system might actually have the answer for this broken system so that's part of the to the and the end we're all mad men is that um one of the ways i see life is like you know this is another type of womb like we had a we were a child we were in a womb and there are parts of us we don't need yet that are there you know so it might be i don't remember being a baby to you but um there might be parts where it was awkward to have legs and arms like but that you need in life and and there's this moment where right before you're born where it's the least hospitable space you're just you're you're scrunched in there and life kind of works like that too in the sense that are still there are still things that are in us um that we don't know what they're there for and we don't know why these desires are here and there's they're on the other side of a thing we can't see yet but so part of where i was like realizing like the power was in us writing about the end of the world all the time was that that's what life feels like we're crunched up against the edge of this thing we're just we're and that things make less and less sense our bodies are changed by this technology we don't understand how this technology has really shaped our body away even to want things that aren't a part of our nature so uh i think that that's the in the end we're all mad men is that there's that moment of birth that's ahead like you want to look at it that way it's like just doesn't make it's not good for anybody in that moment it's not good for the mom it's not good for the baby like but it needs to happen and we seem to be at this point where everything's just getting crushed yeah you know in in the next things just around the corner so uh that's and then our life also like i mean when you talk about looking at patterns our life is just you know our every day is a really good example of what your life is like and the way you wake up you get to your feet you become aware you get energy you run out of energy you get sleepy and you lay down that's a life in general too and so the world just seems to be like right there it's like run out of stuff and it's everybody's getting lazy and weird and and stressed and crunched and meanwhile we can satiate all of our desires and so it's just the madness is abounding yeah exactly yeah like you said it is it's like it's the end of the day and that's the moment where people don't know what to do and so some people will play games some people will get sleepy some people will try to satiate themselves just put the tv on until they fall asleep exactly that definitely it definitely feels like where we are and so but i i think that i i really appreciate you kind of positing it as this hope you know as this capacity through the pattern to be able to see beyond this this first veil that appears to us because sometimes i get lost and i get discouraged because you know i all i see is the breakdown and i don't realize like you said in an absolute truth which if there's a breakdown it means that there's a resurrection on the other side and so if we can keep our focus on on that then then all of this madness will won't be as difficult to bear yeah too for artists and just the average person too i mean it's like there's no less good in the world it's just in fewer and fewer places um which means that when you see it hopefully it shines brighter so like that's the hope at the end of the tunnel is that as people like kind of give in to this hedonism and you know this this self-indulgence is that it just makes what's good left shine brighter so it stands out yeah yeah all right neil this is awesome i really appreciated it and and so i would say everybody check out dirtport robbins we'll put all the links i hope you appreciated this i am really uh i'm excited for the things that are coming down the line we have some some announcement to make very soon uh about some some uh stuff that neil and i and other people that you know are working on so we're excited to announce that very soon so stay tuned to that and uh neil i wish you the best thank you it's good to talk to you
