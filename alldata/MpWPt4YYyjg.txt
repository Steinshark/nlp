this is the mini moo glove um which i have developed for um imogen heap and pimaroni and it's a children's gesture controlled midi instrument and basically it makes really cool bleeps and bloops and when you program it to when on shake on tilts on upside downs on 3g on um freefall they sew it themselves they wire it themselves they code it themselves and then they play it there's a really simple version of a much more complicated piece of technology and called the mimu glove which is very cool midi instrument that has all sorts of things in it accelerometers it's got flex sensors it's got really it's got its own embedded wireless network you know it's it's really made for concert level um use i was really inspired by that technology so i've been working with imogen to create a really stripped down version of that um which essentially just uses an accelerometer to know where it is it's based on a micro bit which is a really cheap little micro controller used primarily in schools it's programmable in micro python but you can also use block code which makes it great for beginners or people who don't really get on with text-based coding and also means that because you can use block code you can take it down to probably around seven and age seven can can do these fine it's got some little onboard blinky leds it's got an accelerometer it's got a magnetometer it's got ble sorry bluetooth it's got radio which i absolutely love the radio functionality is really good it's only got a few little pins but it does the job it's a really nice introduction i actually use this even at university level when i'm teaching electronics just for a rapid prototyping exercise because you can get something up and running on this much quicker than you can on a more complicated board like arduino or any other micro controller of your choice great little piece of kit really cheap really sturdy you can throw them across the room they survive pretty much like i've abused it i've even washed one and it's come out all right it's an amazing child-friendly microcontroller helen friendly microcontroller anyway so i based it on this because it's a really um nice cheap piece of um kits that you're able to then reuse and reprogram in your own different ways the early bits of code just use the accelerometer functionality but you can use anything really and it's just i find it easier to just pick one input and one output and when you're first introducing microcontrollers so the input obviously is the accelerometer so it knows where it is on these axises and the output is signed so this is something that i designed with pimoroni this is the world's first i think um sewable speaker so this is um this is a really cute little chiptune and i've got one um off here this is one of the prototypes with a very nice matte finish and you can see it's got just power and grind and crocodile clip and sewing friendly things and then on the back flip it over we got here it's basically just a little speaker it works really nicely um and the design's really cute as well and i got to press go on the pick and place machine which was a personal goal i've had um one kid who made it into a sound effect glove so you punch forward just like pew um i had one kid which was really funny just run up to me say hey can it tell if it's in free fall i'm like yeah yeah i could tell that it's like like for example if you jumped off a building i was like yep yep you can tell that and this little smile spread across his face and he runs back to his table he comes back later drops a glove off of them off of a table and it starts playing the funeral march so this kid has made the most macabre piece of technology so that's the simple version but there's also um which uh which is very simple it just does like kind of square wave based music so very chip tuney very like old-school kind of sega but you can do something stuff which is much more complicated with it so as i said there's a range of different sensors on board there's a piece of software called glover which takes sensor data and translates it into midi files which will then talk to garageband or ableton live which is what i'm using for my music production so i'm able to not just control um electronic music but i'm then also able to patch through to midi instruments for example this um is triggered by gesture coming from this so i've got three three stages to it so i've got my gesture here which is going into my computer using bluetooth and it then converts it into a midi file which is readable by um garageband ableton live or whatever and i can trigger external instruments through that as well so whether that's something like this or a drum beat um or some kind of amazing i can do vocal loops with it as well that's really that's a really fun thing to do but that's a lot more complicated but it but those are kind of things that you can actually use in performance um so you know it's it's it's from the basic chiptune um glove and all the way up to actual music making on stage so basically i've made a little pitch this is so on and all we've got is ground power and data so i'm just using pin zero but they can use whatever one they want and that just corresponds down here ground 3v and pin 0. the crocodile clip will be much more elegant than the real thing let me just pair it up so this is normally wireless and i'm only using the usb cable because i don't have any actual um batteries it's what happens halfway through a festival i think so this code was actually written by an 11 year old girl um and when i gave her this i just give her um one instruction which was to make a bad ding and then she just ran with it and she made a call choreography so basically um it's a taylor swift song so here we are and then she does indeed shake it off but then i got this other one to do this as well your viewers might be a bit more familiar with that you can control tempo you can control the notes obviously you can pre-program them or you can have them directly respond to where your arm is in space you can have different things playing when you point north people get it really easily and they just want to have a go everyone's got a song they want to make or a sound effect they want to do and you know i don't need to tell people what to create with these kind of things i think they're fairly intuitive so i just enjoy watching but speed isn't an issue i know it bothers a lot of people number one youtube comment is too slow but you know people don't understand real physics of stuff so i was pretty much for shows now i think i actually wrote a program that converts midi files into svgs then i can load the svg into the laser cutter software
