[Music] welcome whoa whoa whoa whoa we are back with another week of the biggest things to happen in Tech this past week and this week was surprisingly really wild and I say surprisingly okay let me back up here this is we're a little too close here this week was surprisingly wild for everything that happened in Tech why surprisingly well for one a lot of the news that came out this week actually affects you and I in more specific terms it really could affect our jobs all right today I'm going to break down the top five biggest things to happen in Tech this past week so you can get caught up in under 10 minutes under nine whatever this video comes to but under 10 minutes on the biggest things so you don't have to go and read a ton of different articles like I just spent a lot of time doing if you haven't already hit that subscribe button give this video a like and let me know if you like these Tech News videos I love doing them because a it's a great way to stay up to date very quickly as to what's going on in the world of tech be it helps me I mean it helps me stay up to date too so let me know all right let's get into [Music] it let's start with Reddit you know they haven't been in the news for a minute we saw a few months ago back in the summer actually there was a lot of news around them in particular around their API usage and how they are going to be charging or were going to be charging more for the usage of it which actually went through I believe in the end now they are back in the news this time with something really interesting that's really important for you to keep your eye on Reddit plans to launch their IPO in March so pretty soon here this quarter uh according to different reports all right so I have up here Tech Crunch and here is what they have to say so Reddit is preparing to launch its initial public ARF offering in March and this is from a new report from rooters rooters routers r e u t RS rooters they actually going down in the article they were founded back in 2005 I kind of forgot they were this old of a company and there have been reports for quite a few years Rumblings if you want about Reddit going public and it looks like it's going to actually happen now they aren't commenting on this matter they actually declined to but in the report it states that they are looking to sell around 10% of its shares in the IPO that's really interesting I'm curious to hear is this something that you would look into investing what do you think is the future for Reddit Al do you use Reddit are you a Reddit user I feel like there's either there's two camps in this people who love Reddit and use it all the time and then people who are like ah what is Reddit all right this next one affects you and I potentially potentially and this is an article that CNN released which is a report from the IMF and now I wasn't too familiar with the IMF if I'm being totally CID maybe it's because I'm Canadian I mean that shouldn't really matter it's not directly tied to the US but I did some research on it and I will tell you a bit more about it in a sec here but here is what their report actually found nearly 40% of Global Employment could be disrupted by Ai and this is according to the IMF now let me dive into the article a bit further here now the world economic Forum meetings have been taking place actually throughout this week Sam Alman was there speaking so I think it's interesting that statement was put out before uh he was speaking actually so here is what he said so one of the things that um I was reading about is he has a sign apparently above his desk that says no one knows what will happen which is so true which is why we need regulation and a lot of other things but anyways and it's important to have these conversations but I wanted to kind of sum up what his conversation or his talk was at the Forum I feel like when I was going through some of his main points they're really positive overall he's really looking at this technology from a positive perspective which gets me excited because I feel as though he's always been very realistic as to his approach and predictions with AI so the fact that these ones are pretty positive got me excited one was there's a few different ones but one was AI will be able to explain its reasoning to us like how cool is that I don't know I think that's pretty cool so what he goes on to say is I can't look into your brain to understand why you're thinking what you're thinking but I can ask you to explain your reasoning and decide if that sounds reasonable to me or not I think our AI systems will also be able to do the same thing they'll be able to explain to us in a natural language the steps from A to B so how they got to the answers they did that would be really incredible especially when you start thinking about it from use cases of educational purposes coding really science-based things especially Hands-On I always come back to coding because if they were able to exp if AI was able to really explain how it got from point A to point B with logical or reasoning it it would really change things all right coming at number three I feel like this would be a big Miss if I didn't bring it up although it kind of brings a damper to this video which is Big Tech layoffs are back honestly honestly I thought we'd go into 2024 with less layoffs I thought you know going ending 2023 it was looking kind of promising and I thought okay this is going to be good 2024 is going to be our year it was it's not been good so far there has been thousands and thousands of layoffs and it's mainly not only with big Tech but definitely big Tech is taking the lead right now on the number of layoffs actually according to layoffs FYI there has been nearly 8,000 workers so far this year laid off and I mean it's January 18th it's 2 and 1/2 weeks into the new year that's pretty staggering now analysts are predicting that a lot of these layouts actually have to do with artificial intelligence kind of going back to what we were speaking about with the IMF and their predictions uh we are seeing that artificial intelligence is starting to play a role in job layoffs now of course it will create new jobs we all know that and new roles but the downside is it will also replace some roles now I think too in this article this one's from ABC News and one of the quotes actually that from a professor of management at the Columbia University business school this is what this professor says tech companies are hiring and firing on a small scale very often because they're still experimenting how to commercialize and scale AI I think we're really in this interesting period of time where it's exactly that it sums up really well companies are still figuring out how are they going to use AI to what capacity and how will this affect everyone's roles so it is something that it will level out eventually but we're in this really interesting time where companies are just starting to realize okay how big of a role does AI actually play in our company all right coming in at number four I'm sorry this is another AI one but this week is really heavy with AI and I don't want you to miss these big headlines so this one is around Zuckerberg and actually he just this article actually just came out today and Mark Zuckerberg's new goal is creating AI artificial general intelligence and he wants to do it via open source I think this is a huge step in the right direction especially when we bring open source into the picture uh it really will help I think keep us or hold us and big companies accountable but let's take a back step back here I feel like I just said something very very strong and maybe we didn't really understand how powerful this is he wants AGI artificial general intelligence so what is that so artificial general intelligence is here is the definition of it the representation of generalized human cognitive abilities in software so that they can be faced with an unfamiliar task an AGI can find a solution this is kind of probably aad B ex well it's not a terrible example but you can think of it as AI can essentially be cognitive it can think for itself find solutions to problems that we don't have to prompt it to do and you can also call I mean some sometimes people refer this to being like God like intelligence for technology so I mean it's really interesting he's entering the race as far as developing AGI goes it's even more interesting he wants to make it open source I don't know what are your thoughts on this is this Tech technology going a little too far are we going to get there with AGI what are your thoughts all right last but not least CES happened and it feels like honestly it was quite a while ago but it wasn't so I thought let's do a quick recap I wanted to share with you something that um I thought was really cool just to end on a really fun and light Note have you seen from CES Hollow box so I'll put up an image here but essentially Hollow box makes hologram communication which I mean like it gets me so excited you think about from all the movies you have seen like this is my dream coming true being able to be a hologram like I mean what what companies are working on it and it's getting pretty close Okay so Hollow box all you need to do is ensure you are standing you as a human you as a person are standing in front of a white well-lit wall then what will happen is you will be able to through a box as you can see back on the image the Box will resemble a telephone booth and can display real life hologram of the person you are talking to that's that's really cool I'm kind of speeches on this one so the website goes on to say actually that they have something called a hollow box mini that can be used on your desktop computer which is pretty cool I don't know this technology still has a little bit to go but the fact that this is being worked on and is at this level That's so exciting I feel like I could it takes FaceTime to a whole new level I mean if I could have a hologram of my mom when I'm talking to her that's pretty cool let me know your thoughts or maybe you feel like it's gone too far let me know in the comments all right I hope you enjoyed this Tech Roundup I know it was mainly AI but that's kind of what's been on everyone's minds and I really think it's important for you to be aware of what is going on it is end of day you can see it is getting dark here living in Canada I'm telling you it gets dark way too early now all right thank you all so much and I'll see you soon bye ooh don't want to break [Music] that [Music] m
