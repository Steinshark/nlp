today we're going to talk about gear regrets because I've made more than a few mistakes over the years let me know if this sounds familiar you're sitting at home innocently binge watching YouTube film making Gear reviews and for whatever reason you start to feel that itch to pull out your credit card and feed the little gear monster in your head maybe the influencer is just really convincing like And subscribe or maybe you have a specific problem and it looks like whatever that product is is going to be the perfect solution so you pull the trigger and hope for the best but down the road you realize that you made a mistake and you'd have been better off spending your money somewhere else and since the only thing worse than spending way too much money on film making gear is spending money on filmmaking gear that you're not really happy with you're left with a hole in your wallet and your sad filmmaker's heart and this isn't something unique to new filmmakers either because even after nearly 15 years working with cameras professionally I'm still being influenced to buy gear that I regret later so that's exactly what this video is all about five pieces of film making gear I was influenced to buy by the internet that I lowkey regret now at the end I'll give some tips on what I wish I'd bought instead so you can save your time and cash okay let's go so I don't normally like to throw shade at specific people or brands on this channel because I'd like to think that we can have more of an impact through positivity than by being critical but the last time I skirted around naming the brands I didn't like people were not impressed and they let me know in the comments so this time I'm not going to hold anything back and it should also go without saying that just because I regret buying these things it doesn't mean there's anything wrong with them I mean if they work for you then they work for you so don't take anything personally I also called this video gear that I low-key regret because I'm not saying that this gear is trash or that it ruined my life or anything dramatic like that but these are things heavily promoted to filmmakers and if I could go back in time I'd give it all a pass and that's helpful information for all of you out there building up your own kits at least I hope it is because it's just stuff at the end of the day though I'm sure I'm going to get some haters in the comments anyways but such is the way of life on YouTube I'm just going to start out hot here and really go for it by blasting one of the most popular film making items of the last few years the peak design tripod I can already hear the collective gasp of the internet shock here because this thing seems to get rave reviews from everyone who touches it and after hearing so many good things about it myself I picked up one of the carbon fiber ones for my own kit a few years ago and yes I know this is the aluminum one and not the carbon fiber one but I'll get into that in a second I'm not going to sit here and pretend that the peak design is bad because honestly it's one of the most unique and clever pieces of tripod design I've ever seen sort of like a mini flow Tech it packs up really small it has a carrying capacity of like 20 lb and it's really light when I first got one myself I thought it was pretty amazing and I was convinced that the hype was worth it and for certain types of shooting it is pretty awesome the problem was the more I used it the more I saw its limitations as a film making tripod and I started to feel kind of bad about how much I'd spent on it because those things are crazy expensive at $600 for the carbon version and 400 for this aluminum version and that's not Pocket Change especially of us for those having to buy in US dollars from other countries like the exchange rate to Canadian dollars right now is $130 I mean come on don't worry I have to go first I'm American and considering that it's only really useful for static shots it's a very expensive investment let me explain what I mean by that because of the way it's designed the head locks into place using this unique twisting system which makes it really fast and easy to set up but only if you're filming something that doesn't move like if you're using it as a bam angle on an interview or only for locked off Landscapes then this tripod does the job perfectly but if you need to track a subject in any way you're not going to do it with this thing you can always mount a video head on the top of it then the form factor and portability are pretty much ruined and that's kind of the whole point of this thing now if I was a Stills photographer only my opinion would be way different but for what I do I can only really count on these tripods for very specific types of shots or as a static shot for an interview and none of that would really bother me enough to include the tripod on this list except for the fact that they also seem to be pretty fragile about 2 years ago I lost the original carbon fiber version I owned to this sticky fingered baggage handler at an airport so basically I'm saying someone stole it in transit and I just couldn't bring myself to spend another $800 Canadian Dollar on another Carbon Fiber One it's just too much money so I replaced it with this aluminum version under a year ago and it's already broken it started with all the legs sort of sagging at different times under load they kept slipping even though they were locked and that was just with an fx3 mounted to it when it was supposed to be able to handle 20 lbs so I tried to tighten all the sections to compensate which sort of worked but then another section would start slipping and then I'd have to tighten that one and the whole thing just kept repeating itself over and over again and now it doesn't lock at all so okay these things happen and I'm definitely used to my gear taking damage and maybe I wouldn't be so bothered except for the fact that there was a second shooter on the same show who also had one of the these and with his this knob was broken it's the one that tightens the central column so that the internal Springs inside seem to have all broken apart and neither of us could see a way to repair it that doesn't exactly Inspire confidence in something that's considered one of the world's most expensive travel tripods and it means I don't really trust them anymore plus their complicated proprietary design means that if something does go wrong it's pretty tough to fix using generic parts or tools if it's fixable it's going to stay in my kit as an interview tripod or for static situations and I'm sure it'll do the job but it's way too expensive to be doing such a basic job so feel free to let me know all the reasons I'm wrong and why these things are worth all the hype they've gotten in the comments and if you're only shooting Stills it might be a different story but if you're trying to shoot video in a non-studio environment I definitely have lowkey buyers REM mors about spending so much money twice on something that's got a pretty limited range of uses in my kit all right that was quite the rant and I promise I'll keep things moving a bit faster from here on out because I've got four more regrets to cover the next thing I low-key wish I'd never bought never leaves my office and that's my drobo hard drive array I'm not even going to try and hold it up here cuz it weighs like 30 lb but if you don't know what they are they're just normal hard drive banks that hold 3.5 in drives but they have this proprietary algorithm that lets them set up raid backups without using as much storage Bas as normal I won't go in the science here mainly cuz I fully don't understand it myself but it somehow makes a double backup of all your files without using double the data by Distributing the files across the drives in a unique way basically you save a bunch of space and that's what's made it so attractive to me when I first saw them being sold by influencers online a few years ago and it does work as advertised I'm not saying it doesn't and unlike the peak design tripods I'm still able to use it even now 5 years later the problem is that when it comes to backing up your life's work I only realized after I bought it that using a proprietary software for my master backups was a bad idea because of whatever weird math sorcery they're doing inside to stretch out the storage space these drives do not communicate with anything else other than another drobo that means if something goes wrong with my enclosure I can't just pull all the drives out and then plug them into another computer for Recovery I can only view things with another drobo that means being locked into one brand forever unless you buy a full other system and transfer everything over I don't know about you but this makes me really anxious the point of backups is to feel secure and having your work protected not worrying about whether or not I'll be able to recover in an emergency and I have no idea how long this company will stay in business or what I'll do in the long term if I can't get another compatible drobo so even though this still works it's failed in its main job of making me feel like my data is safe and that's just not cool if I were starting again I'd give these things a hard pass and just go for a generic Drive Bay like from otherw world computing or something and then I wouldn't have to worry about whether or not I'll be able to find another drobo when the time comes don't be fooled by all the friendly design and cool marketing these products lock you into an ecosystem that I don't want to be a part of personally and that's where the regret comes in from me just go with something else moving on the next low-key regret on my list isn't even about one specific brand but more like an entire class of gear that was at the top of every online influencers buy list around 2021 and I kind of got sucked into it with everyone else and here I'm talking about filters specifically the whole variable ND with mist built-in that seemingly everyone on YouTube was raving about in the mid pandemic internet world I mean I do get the sudden popularity of mist filters because everyone's kind of trying to make their cameras seem less digital or sharp and a little more organic but in my opinion things got a little carried away and it feels like every filmmaker out there for a while was putting Mist in front of their glass hence the rise of all these combination filters and I jumped on the bandwagon with everyone else and when I was ordering my mat box from Polar Pro I picked the Mist v&d combo filters instead of just straight vnd the problem is I regret it now mist is fine don't get me wrong and and I'll use it on my own shoots if it feels right the issue is that none of the high-end professional shoots that I work on have ever wanted it because they all really just prefer a cleaner look meaning that the filters have never been used in a professional setting straight ND filters would have been a much better choice and I could have had a much easier time renting those to Productions than these missed versions and if I'm really honest I don't think I can ever remember a single time when I've actually used these things this is not a bash of the Polar Pro system because I actually love the mat box The Base Cam mattebox and it lives on my camera for most shoots but I do think the trend of misting everything on YouTube doesn't reflect what people are looking for in a professional documentary setting I feel like a bit of a broken record here but I'll say it again you need to make up your own mind when it comes to this stuff and if you need Mist for some reason then go for it and it does look nice when you're filming that boxing gym scene with tube lights that I've seen about a thousand times on YouTube look if you need Mist you need it but in my experience working as a professional documentary DP people just aren't asking for this look most of the time and if they are it needs to be very subtle so in my opinion only get the combo version after you already have very good ND and variable ND filters without the effects and then if you find you want the Miss look then expand your kit but don't force yourself into a quote unquote trendy look on every shoot because you have no other choice like everything when it comes to film making Trends from anamorphic lenses to stabilize gimbal shots make choices like adding Mist intentionally because it makes in that specific case don't Just Go With It by default I'm sure I'm going to trigger people here with my misting so feel free to let me know how wrong I am in the comments here I hate you next up is my old Nemesis a piece of gear I feel like I'm constantly bad mouthing on this channel the gimbal but you might be surprised to know that I'm actually not talking about the gimbal itself because even though I seem to always be saying how gimbals are overused in my opinion I actually do own a Gimbal and use it fairly regularly like we just talked about with the mfil filters gimbals are great when they're used intentionally and mine has more than made its money back over the years but when I bought my gimbal I got sucked in by the pro combo kit add-on and ended up with a bunch of extra stuff that cost me a couple hundred extra dollars that I never use and specifically here I'm talking about the Raven eyes and the fall Focus Motors here because at least for me I've never even tried to set these things up and every time I see them in the case I feel guilty for wasting the cash now obviously if you're making car commercials with your Ronin and you're sending a wireless signal out to a remote operator then the combo kit is a great idea and I'm sure you'll have all sorts of uses for it cuz the technology is actually really cool it's not like it's bad Tech it's actually incredible Tech the issue is that for normal Shooters especially dock Shooters like me there's just very few scenarios will have the time or need to build it all out one of the main appeals of a ronin beyond the stabilization itself is how fast and easy it is to get set up and running when you really need that stable shot so doing a bunch of extra rigging and feeding a signal to a remote Operator just doesn't make practical sense most of the time for me if you're the type of shooter who needs this stuff then by all means go for it but if you're like me and won't actually do setups this complicated most of the time the combo kit is a low-key regret that I wish I didn't have all right so if I haven't already alienated everyone enough yet with these hot takes I've got just one more thing to add to the list one of the most necessary accessories for any camera these days is a monitor because even high-end cameras like my fx9 come with terrible stock monitor that you're going to want to swap out as soon as possible especially if you're shooting 4K they're just too small to give you an accurate idea of your frame and more importantly your focus because if you've ever missed focus by even a little bit when shooting 4K you'll know that it's super obvious and pretty much ruins the shot so maybe a year and a half ago I was gearing up to shoot a feature film about tree planters and I was looking to get an external monitor for my fx3 rig and I really didn't feel like spending a ton of cash on something like a small HD this was for my bcam after all and a really good monitor is expensive and the deeper I went down the YouTube rabbit holes of influencers recommending the top 10 monitors for under $200 whatever I started to believe that I could save a ton of cash and still get something solid so I ordered an Andy cine 6in ultrabrite Monitor and I was pretty proud of myself for not overspending the problem was the thing was almost completely useless for what I needed sure it was bright and it had all the bells and whistles like false color and Lut support and all of that stuff but in the ways that count like accurate exposure and bang on focus peaking it was terrible the focus peak in particular was brutal to use and it drove me crazy right away and within about 3 hours of shooting I took it off and never used it again I actually gave it away to one of my mentorship students dwe when the shoot wrapped and the whole thing left such a bad taste in my mouth that I hope no one out there makes the same mistake I did for 30 bucks more you can get one of these which is an adamos Shinobi which is a way better monitor in pretty much every way that counts for my money if you need an on camera monitor stick with a Shinobi or Ninja on the lower end something like a TV logic in the mid-range and then like a small HD 503 ultrabrite for a high-end High budget option stay away from anything that sounds too good and too cheap to be true because it most likely is in the world of monitors and there we go five items that I was influenced to BU that I low-key regret now I'm sure I made a couple of enemies with that one but it does feel good to get that off my chest because some of these things like the monitor really did make me mad in the moment and make it hard to shoot most of the stuff I talked about wasn't necessarily bad though and there's going to be some specific use cases where it all makes sense and everyone has their own needs but for my money if I had a magical time machine I'd give all five things a pass if I were you see
