hello everyone and welcome I had the privilege of joining the Western Automotive journalist 2017 track day at Mazda Raceway Laguna SAA where I was able to test out some of the latest and most capable cars from many different manufacturers this video is dedicated to discussing how these vehicles perform on a track and does not necessarily speak to their on-road friendliness I will also be showing lap times but know that this is not a competitive event it's an event for evaluation so I'll be breaking very conservatively and I'm far from a professional race car driver at that there are plenty of variables that affect the lap times including traffic from other drivers whether the Tires and Brakes were cold warm or too hot once I got out on the track from the previous driver and of course my own skill level so disclaimers aside we'll discuss four of the cars that I was most impressed by on the track and then four of the cars where my expectations were quite different than how I actually felt driving them on the track my most enjoyable Drive of the day was in the Alfa Romeo Julia fourleaf Clover version and I do promise that I don't consider this the best purely because it's the newest and perhaps the most exotic car here it's genuinely an amazing machine on the track of all the cars I drove it was easily one of the most balanced inspiring great confidence at nearly any speed under the hood is a twint turbo 2.9 L 90Â° V6 engine producing 505 horsepower and 443 LBT of torque a potent 175 horsepower per liter but it wasn't the most powerful car here and it certainly wasn't the lightest car here in fact Alpha doesn't even list the weight of the car in their press kits though Motor Trend weighed one in at around 3,800 lb even with the weight it was my fastest lap around the Raceway for which I purely attribute its balance and predictability to provide confidence for even a novice driver such as myself in second place we're in the Mazda MX5 Miata RF Mazda's latest hardtop convertible MX5 this is the club version with an LSD and manual transmission the RF adds a little over 100 lb of additional weight though dynamically it feels very similar to the soft top the weight distribution is a perfect 50/50 split without a driver in the seat with the weight shifted slightly back from the soft top the car is an absolute joy to drive with near perfect predictability and a highly approachable limit if you decide to push the car too hard letting off the throttle or brakes and a minor steering correction puts you right back on Pace I'd probably have given this car first place if it weren't for the fact that the steering wheel does not telescope and that my head with helmet was smashed against the ceiling for the track Drive yes I'm 6'1 but I don't think that's all that absurd of a height to fit in a modern car my lap time was just slightly better than the BRZ n86 Duo which conveniently brings us to our third and fourth cars the Subaru BRZ and the Toyota 86 twins both have a very similar Dynamic feel to the MX5 very very balanced and predictable easy to push hard with just a bit more half to pull around the track but also a bit more power while the tires aren't particularly graceful on a track they like to over steer it's an insanely fun car to drive hard as it rewards drivers of all abilities to find the cars limits the brz's performance package is also tremendous value adding new shocks 17-in aluminum alloy wheels and most importantly for track use significantly larger Brembo brakes both front and rear all for $1,200 that's a much better deal than Mazda's $3,400 Brembo and BBs package which only provides brembos on the front wheels and there doesn't seem to be a significant size difference for track days the BRZ with performance package won't let you down and will comfortably fit taller drivers but perhaps the best thing about the 86 BRZ Duo is the steering feel on track the tight steering ratio rewards those who drive with precision and prevents your arms from crossing over in tight turns for a modern vehicle it provides some of the most valuable feedback through the steering wheel to your hands and is part of what makes this car so easy and enjoyable to drive hard there were however several cars which my expectations were Far From Reality on the Jaguar ftype svr Dodge Challenger ta Fiat 124 abar Spider and the Lexus lc500 having driven the Jaguar ftype svr on the road it is absolutely one of the most thrilling Vehicles I've ever been in that's why I was a bit surprised to not have quite the same feeling about it while driving driving on the track it's not that it's not fun it definitely is but it's not the most well- behaved vehicle on the track which is part of what I found exciting about it on the road the balance is a bit Twitchy and the rear end never fully commits to a corner even with all-wheel drive on top of which if you're too quick with your throttle application the shock load of acceleration bounces up and down the drive line kind of similar to driving a manual transmission car in first gear at superload speeds and letting on and off the throttle just not quite as exaggerated the car is absolutely phenomenal it simply feels much better suited for the road than the track which is fine since that's probably where most will be spending their time the Dodge Challenger ta 392 on the other hand was surprisingly impressive every time I enter one of these cars and I've driven numerous Challengers I'm always expecting it to behave like a boat the way the specs make it seem like it will and yet every time I exit the car feeling quite impressed by how well behaved it is with a 485 horsepower 6.4 L V8 engine six piston brembos up front and four piston brembos in the rear a revised suspension geometry and 275 mm wide pelli performance tires the car is actually quite at home lapping around a circuit it was my third fastest car around the track for the day and had me grinning as I rolled back into the staging area moving on to another member of the FCA family the Fiat 124 Spider Abarth is one of the most fun Vehicles you can buy for the money yet somehow I was a little let down by how it felt on the track it's not that it isn't near perfect it truly is a remarkable vehicle but yet I found myself having more fun in the MX5 and BRZ 86 Duo the only two real downfalls I have for the car aside from once again I'm a bit too tall for it is the shifting and the engine response on the street neither feel like an issue but on the track the manual shifter is noticeably more clunky than Mazda's allnew six-speed box in the MX5 again fine for the street but just doesn't feel quite as smooth on the track and as far as the engine waiting for the tiny 1.4 L engine to crank the Boost all the way to 22 PSI is a noticeable time delay don't think I'm saying it's not one of the best vehicles out here and for the money it's not even a question but while I expected greatness from the rave reviews of this car on and off the track I still have feeling like the MX5 was the better buy now as mentioned in a previous video which I'll link in the description I found the Lexus lc500 a bit of a disappointment especially in comparison to the cheaper and significantly lighter Lexus GSF yes the GSF is an F car and as such is better Geared for a track but if we're all being honest lexus's lineup in general doesn't make track machines and the GSF is a luxury sedan far before it's a sports car but not only does the GSF have the performance to take on the lc500 it's an amazing ride on the street as well all at a lower price point and while I do think the lc500 has a beautiful exterior the GS doesn't sacrifice on interior quality as you can see it's strikingly similar and I think both are well executed luxury cars whether or not they belong on a track is debatable but nonetheless that's what I was here at this event to compare if you're curious here's a complete list of my lap times and cars that I actually recorded know that comparing these lap times directly doesn't make a ton of sense unless you analyze the whole lap some of the cars required being off throttle after turn five for a noise ordinance sometimes I fell into traffic sometimes drivers were passing me and I needed to give them space and of course I was a bit more confident towards the end of the day so the order which I drove the cars in matters quite a bit I will also include videos of all of the Laps on my second Channel engineering explained extra so if you're curious about any of the specific car laps you can check them out there with data overlays and GPS loggers a great example of how these lap times can be misinterpreted without context is by looking at my best MX5 lap versus my best 124 lap though the 124 was 3 seconds faster it's because about 3 seconds were lost waiting in traffic at the beginning of my MX5 lap once free the cars had nearly identical lap times thanks everyone for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below as mentioned all of the cars with lap times will have videos posted on my second channel eextra to check out if
