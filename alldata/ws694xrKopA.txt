- Today we're gonna test
multiple different ways to stop a cannon. We're gonna try magnets. Legos. A bulletproof vest. A mannequin. We put some baseballs in the cannon and we put some gloves on the people. Need I say more? Do you think this is the first time a baseball's ever been
fired from a cannon? - Can't be. - Hey, Chandler. What's that? - Made you look.
- Whoa. The legs are standing here.
- Did the glove catch it? - No way.
- I very much doubt. - Did the gloves croak? - Did it go through the glove? - Kind of broke it.
- Dude, wow. - Found a baseball. - Oh, wow. - Oh, there it is.
- Wait. - Oh, there it is.
- Oh, my goodness. - It's still perfect. Hold on. Let's see. - That is a crispy baseball. - Is that what it smells like? Popcorn? - It smells terrible. - Is that what popcorn? - Ooh, man, that smells bad. Smell it. - This is legit real bulletproof glass. I'm actually curious if
it'll stop this cannon. - You don't think that
the bulletproof glass can take a cannonball? - No, it's a cannon. - But you think so? - Oh, it's coming back. It's
right there. It's right there! - Whoa. Whoa. - Yo, the bulletproof
glass beat the cannonball. Dude, here's the cannonball. - So I'm confused. Why didn't Blackbeard just
have bulletproof glass? - I know, right? - Easy. - They're watching the
slow-mo, guys. Watch. - Oh, damn. - Oh, my god. That makes you, like, jump. It's coming right at you. - I love it. - Bulletproof glass can stop a cannon, but can a bulletproof vest? Let's say you become a cop one night and a guy robs a convenience store And he comes out with a cannon. Is your vest gonna protect you? I will answer that. Well, by me, I mean Brandon. - I'm just here for the ride. - We will answer it together
'cause we're a power couple. - Whoa.
- Wow. - How many?
- Oh, my gosh. Look, we caught three. - Dang.
- Look at this beauty. If you had a chest made
outta steel, you'd be fine. - It's a Cardinal feather. - That's a leaf. - The state bird. - That's a leaf.
- That's a leaf, dude. - Just let him. Let him. - You know, they only
come around once a year. - Yeah, they do. Eat it and I'll give
you a thousand dollars. - What'd you say? - Nevermind. - Guys, we're going hot. - We're going hot. I'm ready. - You ready. Whoa. You are ready. - Hey Chandler, high five. High five. - Oh, you missed it.
- Oh, wow. - Oh, that was beautiful. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Good thing we got all
this biodegradable confetti. - This right here is Manny and he's very self-conscious of the fact that he can't grow hair. - Baldy. - It makes him- Chandler. Don't talk about him. He said he's self-conscious. - Stop being a bully. So to make him feel better,
we're gonna take this wig, we're gonna cram it in the cannon and then we're gonna put a
lot of that black powder stuff and then we're gonna shoot it as his head. And hopefully that allows
him to feel more confident in his own skin. - You look like the dude
off of "iRobot," honestly. You know Will Smith? - Ah. - Well, well, well, boys. We meet again. - Going hot! - Oh, going hot, guys. Going hot. - Oh. - Look at that sexy beast. - All right, let's do it. Ooh. - Oh, my god.
- Wow. Boom. Oh, my god. - That was the wig. - I did not expect that to happen. - Dude, right in the chest. Look at that. - He's just got an eye left. That's it. - Well, where's that GoPro, though? Oh, it's still working. - No way.
- Let me see. - Yes. - Hit it with the cannon. This is for all you people
who ever lost money to a ven- I got revenge. Perfect. Guys, if a vending machine
ever steals money from you, hit it with a cannonball. Your vending machine didn't work. I accidentally broke it. I'm gonna clean it up and
take care of it. Okay? - You sure?
- Yeah. - Appreciate it. It's not starting. Blow it up as well. All right, boys. We're gonna show this car who's boss. - Fire it up. - Go. Go. Run. - Oh, my. - That was kind of cool. - Yeah, that was pretty dope. - I got one more! - No. No.
- I got one more! One more.
- That's way too much. That's way too much. - Who's cannon made the
most amount of damage? - Mine. - Chandler, is this, is this your cannon? You really yeeted the yeet cannon. - Mine went all the way through it. - My cannonball is right here, bro. - That's your cannonball? - Yeah. - It didn't even make it to the car. - It hit the door. - Oh, my gosh. You can't even, you can't even
get in this passenger door. Look at this. - That's dope. - It really can stop bullets. - We got a exit wound. - Dude.
- I like that. - It just literally- - Look. You can see right
there where it went through. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, Jimmy. Okay. Little
bit high. Okay, Jimmy. - Now we're gonna see if a Lego
wall can stop a cannonball. - Let's do this. Cannon guys ready. - You just fire cannons and look hot. - Yeah. - Just take your shirt off why don't you? - Ooh! - Tell him to wait. - Oh! Oh, my god. I can see the actual ball on this. - There it is. - Ooh! - Right through. Right in the GoPro. - It just clipped the top. - Just clipped it.
- Very nice. - That's gonna look good on the GoPro. Or not. We'll see, right here. - I've been struggling
with cell phone service so we're gonna see if
shooting it at a wall out of a cannon fixes that. Get it, sexy boy. All right. Good timing. - Did it go over? - Wow. No it didn't. It just annihilated it. - It's literally in there.
- Are you serious? - Wow.
- Wow. - I bet it still works.
- Phone-ski. - Is it hot?
- Nokia the unburnt. - Hey, dad. Oh, thanks. It works now. Thanks guys. This is a fridge. This is a cannon. This is alphabet numbers and letters. - Alphabet numbers and letters? Isn't the alphabet letters? - This is very special to me. I love this. - You write mine? - What if it spelled
something on the fridge? - It burned a O on it. No, an A. What? - Hey, the A. - And a U - And a E. Look a E. - Guys, if your alphabet
magnets aren't working just shoot 'em with a cannon. Here's the new game plan. This is a cannon. It's about this wide. That wide fits right there. So we're gonna slide that cannon in here. Will it work, Brandon? - We're doing what? - Oh fuck. - We need a third. - Oh, my gosh. - We need a third. - You got it. - Oh. Oh. - Oh. - What is this, Chandler? - A cannon. - And what is it inside of? - A cannon.
- Cannon. - We have no idea what's gonna happen. Like, this literally might explode. - Might? - Probably will explode. - So we should back away. Like, a lot away. - This is so dangerous
that we're actually sitting in a U-Haul and watching
it through these mirrors. - All right. That's our
front row seat viewers. - Fuse is lit. - Oh, wow. Fuse is lit. - We can't find the cannon. - Yo, where did the cannon go? - Oh, my goodness. - The cannon, like, disappeared. Oh, you've got to be kidding me. - All the way over here. - How many yards do y'all think that is? - At least three. - I think it's three plus, uh, 25. - Twenty. So 20. - Dude. That is the cannon right here. And that's where we shot it out. - Oh, my God. - We have 50,000 magnets,
a watermelon, and a cannon. So yeah, we're gonna see
if these 50,000 magnets can catch a cannonball mid-air. So here's Big Chungus, and
this is a 40 pound cannonball. I'm scared. I don't wanna break it. - And you give it to Chandler? - He's already broken half the stuff. - Oh, God. - The oven is ready. - All right. It's good. Fire it. - I'm excited. I like cannons. - We're about to shoot the
cannon. It's fin to bust. - Dude, Torique's so scared right now. Look at Torique. - Why am I doing this? - Fire in the hole! - Going hot! - Oh, boy.
- I'm terrified. - I'm scared. - Oh, man!
- Did we hit it? - It did not stop it. - The watermelon and the
magnets couldn't stop it. What? Let's get a closer look. Did you like having a
cannon ram through you? Yes. The 50,000 magnets didn't
catch it outta the cannon. So maybe if I throw it slower it will. - It got one. Two. - Got it. - Oh, Jesus. - Chandler, your turn. - Are you sure?
- Yes. - Unleash it.
- One. - No holding back. - Use more than 1% of your power. - 2%. - Man, you left an actual dent. Don't underestimate dumb strength. - You see that? - Hey, Logan Paul, at me. - What is it? - Chandler's left a dent and yours didn't.
