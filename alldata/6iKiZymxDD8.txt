foreign ERS have been combined into one a concept that isn't exactly new this case from Cooler Master could have as many as three modules stacked up each containing its own PC and corsair's heavyweight obsidian 10 000d could accommodate both a primary eatx system and a secondary mini ITX system both with full-size gpus the issue is both of those Solutions are heavy and cumbersome not to mention that one of the systems is clearly the beta a dynamic that won't fly in this relationship we have actually combined his and hers gaming systems before though using virtualization the issue is that the cost advantage of sharing components like the motherboard and power supply ended up being outweighed by the drawback of running up against anti-cheat solutions that will falsely flag virtualization users for cheating bringing us to the better solution a fast relatively easy mod that allow The Cooler Master nr200p to fit two full fat gaming rigs not fat like like performance gaming rigs all they need is a little nip and Tuck ready let's go [Music] goodbye dead weight now all we need is to remove these three rivets and as long as I don't screw this up we should be good to go just like I'm good at telling you about our sponsor ridge ridge wallet has redefined the traditional big fat receipt filled wallet with its compact frame and RFID blocking plates the Bulge in your pants shouldn't be from your wallet use offer code Linus to save 10 and get free worldwide shipping [Music] here's the idea we're each going to disassemble our case in a similar fashion keeping behind only the parts that we need to mount our motherboard power supply storage Cooling and GPU then we're going to take the two L-shaped pieces and you guys can see where I'm going with this two computers will be like this okay yeah oh that's a little saggy the case it's the case hey I'm not the only one that sags we're getting old okay I've done three screws in the time you've taken to find one we're never gonna get done okay sorry there's probably gonna be some float plane exclusive outtakes and cutting room floor stuff floatplane.com that intro is almost certainly going to be in there it's really cute super cute there you go wild right obviously a project like this raises a number of questions with the first one being how do you turn these things on just I stroke gently [Music] okay no the computer um and we do have the answer to that because obviously our integrated power and reset switches are no longer part of our cases we had to pick up a couple of these little owl tree brand external power and reset switches and just double-sided tape them to the side of the power supply holder it's not very pretty looking it still needs love oh I was gonna be like where's my motherboard because I was expecting something so big but it's so tiny that's what she said as I alluded to before both of these systems need to be similarly powerful so we're using identical motherboards this is a b550i gaming from asus's Rog strix lineup and because we have some thermal concerns packing two such systems into a tiny ITX case that's intended for one we've gone with a reasonable ryzen 5 5600 CPU I mean to be clear that's still six cores a lot of performance it's just not a ton of heat compared to something like a 12 or a 16 core variant Yvonne's going to show us how an AMD CPU is installed I don't think they want to follow my guide I'm pretty sure they want to watch you all right there it's in are you sure actually it's really hard to tell you have to have to confirm I can feel that it's in can you yeah you touching us CPUs you can tell when they're in next up let's do storage we've actually got a number of options for m.2 SSD installation I am going to take the lazy route and not bother to access this one down here and I'm going to install this crucial P5 onto the back of our motherboard I've never seen this before like the rear mounted kind yeah yeah now things are about to get really interesting because these are packed in so tight we can't go just installing our memory and our heatsink willy-nilly everything has to go together in a very specific order so we're each going to take our half cases and put the motherboard in okay I can't get mine in well not like that what you got to go slow first then fast when you're screwing I don't know if people should take advice from you about screwing I'm sorry Brandon you guys make my job very hard next step is power supplies these don't match strictly speaking but they are functionally the same we're both using sfx power supplies so these are the slightly shorter version that only have 92 millimeter rather than 120 millimeter fans but that was necessary for us because even though we have the power supply cage in the sfxl position this way there's just not a ton of clearance for our modular interface here to keep it from interfering with other stuff so we're stuck with sfxl okay so do they go in this way you want your fan going towards the open back part here that way it will draw nice fresh air from the outside of the case because let me tell you the air inside this case is not going to be nice and not going to be fresh we've gone with some crucial ballistics 3200 Mega transfer per second CL 16 modules that you can't even buy anymore so maybe we'll have some other more different Ram Linked In the video description along with the rest of the components we're using so I watched Bella's video did you actually use this to cut open a box yeah is that okay that doesn't ruin the contacts The Box open did the ram work yeah yeah and it's okay all right okay do as I say not as I do and I'm saying don't do that you can see here why we were going to have a pretty hard time plugging in those front panel connectors if we had the RAM installed already that you're getting pretty tight in here no not like that no why why what's wrong yeah yeah like that that's good yeah that's good I don't know if I want to talk to you anymore after this oh you don't need to talk oh I love it with modern systems you don't have to run SATA data and say to power at all your drives anymore so we only need three cables for these builds our 24 pin for the motherboard are eight pin for also the motherboard but it Powers the CPU and then PCI Express for the GPU that's it it makes these kinds of small form factor builds so much easier to Cable manage for our CPU Cooler we've actually got a newcomer to the channel I had never heard of ID cooling before but thanks to those helpful very helpful lists that the sff community have compiled that tell us the exact Heights of like basically every cooler on the market we found that this was as close as we could get to our 70 millimeters of clearance while still having a little bit of room to actually draw in some fresh air and I guess we'll give it a shot we did replace the stock slim fan with a knock to a fan just to get a little bit more performance out of it and in terms of orientation we're going to have our heat pipes up toward the top of the board which just kind of put it on there for now puts our fan right over top of our RAM sticks giving them a little bit of extra cooling which they will need yeah do you want to goop me yeah I thought it was supposed to be a grain of rice it's more good you can never have too much goop I'm pretty sure you can have too much Coop she was so innocent when I met her just defiled me oh profile so there's three of them doesn't matter when it goes in the green one why is it the gray one why not the black one because if you put it in the wrong one it'll complain that is actually the answer if you turn it on it'll say CPU fan speed zero press F1 to whatever now we plug things in let's go ahead and do our 24 pin connector oh boy we are going to want to keep this as tight as we possibly can it's kind of like that this is a cool feature of this case it has little Cable Management anchors on the side of the power supply cage here not that I think I can even get in there well enough to actually use them but it's a neat idea in theory now we're going to plug in one of the gpus so who goes first no there's no rock paper scissors no no you just said who goes first and I said me we've gone with an RTX 3060 Accelerate from PNY and the main reason for that is that it's tiny super cute it's got a large what appears to be 110 millimeter fan on it wow that's awesome for a tiny little mini ITX card also this is a nice little benefit all of the i o is in a row here which means that we're actually going to kick a substantial amount of the heat from this GPU out of the case though we will be kicking some of it into the case which means we're going to have to deal with that with some case fans it's nice that this case uses all the same screws for absolutely everything so we just have a pile of them and when it's time to put it all back together there's no fussing about with like oh what kind of countersunk there Phillips number one Phillips number two yeah this is great every screw head actually does have a purpose except slot slot but you can use like a dime to turn them no you should just always have a screwdriver in your back pocket lttstore.com you don't necessarily have to use exactly this GPU if you were to try to recreate this build as long as you find one that is exactly the length of the motherboard or I mean less would be fine then you should be good to go this is where things start to get a little bit tricky you ready uh your Cable's in the way okay this is no no the cable no no no it was working the cable at the bottom right there was in the way no no we got this okay um oh it's definitely the best way something sounded bad we're good I mean have we merged good is a strong word oh my God okay well the thread has to actually catch though oh no no you're what it's you're cross-threading it oh my gosh they're all over the place here look how well look at that is no get the close-up don't let her hide this no if you would hide it straight then maybe it would go in straight no what are you doing fine how am I supposed to be helping with this or not I don't know it's hard for me to tell quite honestly okay we can tighten them now okay oh oh yes right there okay so you just need to hold it in the right spot nice screws are in all right GPU time and then this goes in but they butt right up against each other wow this is compact uh yep it really does not get much tighter than that which is why we need some cooling fans one tricky thing at this stage is that because we used two halves of the case there's no longer anywhere for this to clip in and we can't use a bottom panel anymore so we have to make a bottom panel out of one of our top panels and the quickest and easiest way to do that is to just bend these little mesh tabs here and this is going to go on a little something like that what's really nice is that because there's no spare random cables here while we are going to use fan grills we're actually going to use them facing outward we don't need to worry about any of the cables you know sticking in our spinning fan blades or anything like that we can plug this in now Boop that'll power both of our fans off of my motherboard so uh that is one slight downside both of the systems should be powered on to ensure that both of them will be adequately cooled and that's basically just providing intake air for these gpus wow like that's it they completely block off that airflow from really any other part of the system which means that when it's time to install our slim fans on our second panel we're actually going to want those as intakes as well and then we're counting on the open ends of the case to help us passively push out all the extra air this time we get to keep our mesh which is a little nicer for keeping dust out of the system okay Brown oh pretty cool oh yes we did screw up one little thing um the bottom needs feet because otherwise these fans are not going to be in taking much of anything again for the three of you who are planning to replicate this build these little rubber feet are from Amazon they're the 13 millimeter tall feet and they're available for just a few bucks uh one thing that I would like to do if I did this again is maybe add some mesh in front of these of some sort like instead of using just regular grills maybe use uh filters that'll help keep a little bit of the dust out of the case there we go it's like a two-headed goat you know and you're just like what is it from it's confusing the confusing PC out of the gate we're going to start with my favorite game bios updating what could go wrong if you multiply your risk it's great this CPU was running about six degrees hotter but also turboing about 500 megahertz higher I mean technically that's fine you play more games than I do so I could just take this one and we don't have to do this well yeah but we specifically went out of our way to make this system one and this system a so nobody has to feel like number two you know I don't care I just want it to work well it isn't working but it is working no if it's not working optimally it's not working oh my gosh and this is why nothing ever gets done we are gonna play Halo infinite let's do team doubles okay okay we got this right well I don't know what I'm doing I don't even know what this game is it's a shooter you point at the bad guys and they fall down okay you ready okay so just stay close to me okay and if someone kills me I shoot at them I don't actually know the objective of this oh there's a hill what's this did I just what just happened I don't know did you just die what do you mean die no I didn't die I was disconnected oh multiplayer is unavailable try get and you wonder why nobody is playing this game oh I don't I'm not wow I killed someone no not now sorry oh surprisingly it's not really any worse than a typical gaming system if anything I'd say it's probably on the quiet side that's really impressive one small note by the way we ended up reversing these top fans we're using them as an exhaust now the difference in temperatures was a few degrees but the way it ended up working out our intake at the bottom ended up being a lot more effective in getting air past those gpus than I expected so we ended up not needing to draw more fresh air in but rather just get rid of some of the heated air I've got blender set to use both CPU and GP okay here we go three two one and they're off okay CPU is at 100 gpus at about 90. this should give us a pretty good idea of what the system will look like under full synthetic load realistically in game are you actually going to get to full load like this no then why would you test it you want to make sure that it is prepared for the worst case scenario my CPU is running a lot lower than yours ah 75 to 68. uh yeah it's also not turboing as high still which is weird I wonder if you just got a not as good chip we'd have to actually take the CPU out and put it in my board and see if it's maybe just slightly better Behavior out of my board to know for sure but okay you did end up with the beta system after all our efforts sorry entirely unintentional for real though does anyone need to save space that badly yeah what are you talking about the apartments and condos nowadays like super tiny you could just build two regular ITX systems and put one on top of the other you know you already had to buy two cases anyway it's super cute though it is cute oh and when you go to a LAN party now you just take one computer with you yes that assumes that your so actually goes to the LAN party with you otherwise it's an inconvenience because now I've taken your computer away that that's true hey I came to your LAN party okay I think we can pretty much call that good these are not going to overheat unlike our relationship and this segue to our hot sponsor Oracle oracle's Cloud world event
