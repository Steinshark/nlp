it's fair to say most of us don't like spreadsheets but the people who do like them like them a lot and while many of us use Microsoft Excel in our day-to-day work and Elite few have adapted the world's most popular spreadsheet software into an Esports phenomenon in 2022 the Excel World Championship debuted as part of ESPN's theoo an annual Showcase of lower profile sports like axe throwing Corgi racing and of course the the slippery stair climb the vast majority of viewers had never even conceived of competitive Exel before because there are some levels of nerdy that are simply Beyond mere mortal Ken but the sport was popular enough that it was renewed for the 2023 oo and will be holding its finale in the Las Vegas hyper X Esports Arena this December with a prize pool of $110,000 across the competition but Excel as an esport didn't appear out of nowhere fully formed in 2022 it came out of an existing culture of financial modeling competitions basically these are tournaments where participants must create a financial forecast for a fictional company based on a provided data set in what else Excel the organizers of the financial modeling World Championship were looking for a way to turn these competitions into a spectator sport because apparently the cultural mainstream is unenthusiastic about debt service coverage ratios which is a real shame they gradually adapted the format to make the contests more exciting and accessible and in mid 2021 they went viral because you know pandemic finally ESPN expressed an interest and the fmwc open was streamed on ESPN 3 in December 2021 the next year Microsoft sponsored the competition lending it their own name and making it the Microsoft Excel World Championship but what does a round of competitive Excel actually look

each round of an Excel tournament has a unique challenge like tabulating the results of a series of hypothetical elections or projecting the outcome of a game of whack-a-mole participants have to answer a series of 100 increasingly difficult questions about the puzzle in only 30 minutes that's roughly one answer every 18 seconds but that assumes that the players are answering them one at a time which they aren't unless time is short and they're desperate questions are typically organized into five batches of 20 questions and the dominant strategy by experienced players is to create a single formula that will solve an entire batch this means that a player's score can stagnate for long periods then jump rapidly it can even go down which means it's time for a quick undo but that might not save novice players who get stuck and wind up with a big fat zero out of a thousand the winner is whoever answers all the questions correctly first or whoever has the most points when the 30 minutes are up the puzzles can vary a lot in terms of difficulty so the points players receive are typically adjusted to normalize scores across games an Infamous 2021 case based on the game civilization was so difficult that the winner managed to get just eight points total narrowly edging out his opponent who managed to accumulate a poultry six both of them were guessing which can be executed quickly and efficiently using the formula ran between to cover large batches of unknown answers familiarity with keyboard shortcuts is obviously a necessary skill to the point that player bios will list their favorite shortcut and there's some hot controversy in The Meta over whether competitive players should ever use a mouse to navigate Advanced players with a fluency in Visual Basic might even code on the Fly unsurprisingly the game tends to be dominated by accountants actuaries mathematicians and Engineers you know the alpha nerds the format of games can vary as well with tournaments sometimes featuring 1 V one elimination matches and other times eight player battle Royals it's brutal a panel of commentators narrate the game dissect the outcome and introduce and interview the players before and after the fact and at in-person events there's often an electric crowd excited to see their favorite Excel battler perform the spreadsheet equivalent of a mounted elbow drop off the top rope and it's not a sport without merch they've got shirts like this invalid formula divide by by zero design or this one with all your favorite formulas I'm partial to equal count ifs open parin closed parin myself the Microsoft Excel World Championship isn't the only Gaming Arena where you'll find Excel it's had a long if eccentric history in gaming usually acting as an external supplementary tool for complex RPGs that require Advanced data management Eve online the game sometimes called spreadsheets in space actually got an official Excel plugin earlier this year much to the excitement of its player base not to mention that people have been programming games directly into Excel for decades like snake mind sweeper and even Battleship if there's anything we can learn from a sweaty crowd cheering on their favorite Excel Champion as they formulate their way to Victory is that human beings can find joy in literally anything and it brings me great joy to see you
