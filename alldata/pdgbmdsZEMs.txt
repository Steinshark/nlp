game and we will of course end with all the games in the match between Magnus and hikaro they play two rapid games and if it's tied one to one then they play an Armageddon where black gets draw odds but it starts with less time let's start with this game between Fabiano Carana and Magnus Carlson Fabby with the white pieces this is rapid game number two Fabby plays E4 my man Magnus came to play E4 Knight C6 D4 D5 and it's like black is playing a drunk caroan basically black has played an advanced caroan but instead there's a knight on C6 now that is not as good as according to the computer because White's Center is very powerful and that black knight does not really truly exert pressure because white can always play Knight A3 and then kick the Knight out with the move C3 but the position that we get gets very imbalanced very quickly C3 F6 Magnus sacrificing development to deal with that inconvenience of a pawn in the center of the board and then here Magnus did some goofy stuff a 5 so he tries to suppress Fabiano's Queen side Fabby just puts a rook in the center Bishop C5 by Magnus and then this move is crazy stockfish hated this move for a second it was like Magnus what are you doing what about the development of your whole side of the board Knight G5 apparently is really strong going after H7 but apparently you can just Castle you can just give the man the pawn you give the man a pawn all of a sudden he gets a little greedy little full so instead of all of that Fabiano decides to play on that side of the board he plays B4 puts his Knight here trades off the Bishops and now we have a position with no Bishops at all Magnus plays B6 controlling Fabiano's Knight Fabby going for Knight G5 now very big moment Magnus down three minutes as Fabiano is putting on the pressure Knight to E7 fi says I don't believe you I think this is stupid I think you giving me that pawn on H7 is bad I'm going to come here good luck ever castling I mean first of all it's illegal right now but if I get out Newcastle you're going to get mated Faby plays Rook H3 beautiful transfer of pieace say and he's giving Magnus the pawn on E5 he's doing it because the king is in the center that would be goofy for Magnus to do and then here Magnus plays a cool common collected King to d8 that is not an over theboard Mouse slip that is a deliver it deliver it deliberate transfer of the king out of the center of the board to C8 where it will be safe maybe not to the B file because that is exactly where you'll get sniped by a rook but on C8 the king is actually safe and then black is going to try to figure things out Fabby Won't Back Down A4 now he's lost this Pawn the position is equal but you have this moment where you realize wait a minute I can't really move my pieces KN G6 Queen G4 Knight E5 and right now Fabiano can make a draw he can I don't know if Magnus would have made a draw but we have a repetition Knight there Queen there Knight back if Fabby goes back to E2 probably the game is he doesn't repeat moves oh Fabiano playing for a win sensing weakness sensing I've got a big time Advantage here against Magnus he wants to bail out I'm going to go hunt him down Pawn to A5 his King is in the center and I'm doing everything right now it's time for Magnus to play defense the king continues his journey to C8 Fano plays rookie one bulldozing the bulldozing the pawn in the center but what about the a pawn what about the Aon well what about the Aon indeed and Magnus says you know what boo I don't think he called him that he says all right prove it now Fab's got to back up now Magnus starts marching down the center that move was given a bit of a dubious mark because of Rook H5 trying to put a little bit more pressure but now Fab's got to defend himself and Magnus is taking over fabbiano got a little bit too care a little bit over aggressive Queen C2 now Magnus is consolidating there was no need for Fabiano to do any of this stuff now they're both under 30 seconds it's chaos but the pawn is coming down and Magnus actually ends this game in beautiful style Queen to B2 and then Queen goes back to just make sure the Knight is like you know not messing around too much but he ends the the game in style it's it's coming queen B1 there it is beautiful little move using the pawn as an anchor and the game's just over cuz there's nothing white can do Fabby is going to be kicking himself Magnus moves to three and0 he has won every match this one could have been a draw there was a there was a draw on the board Fabby could have repeated it was a very tense game credit to Magnus for pulling up with this UGA opening I don't know what this is called the NIMA defense Scandinavian variation the drunk caroon whatever you want to call it there were all sorts of epic games in the rounds no ABD Dennis lazic this went to an Armageddon they drew both their games lavic is a beast he's the youngest man in the field all right he's like 2500 but he is he is Rock Solid now you'll notice Dennis lvic 959 on the clock that is because he wagered that much time he wagered 10 minutes he said I want 10 minutes you give me the black pieces no bonus time until move 60 a draw is a win so look at this opening from nck Abdul sator he plays an opening that gives away all all Advantage but it doesn't have a disadvantage and he just wants a game of chess this is what he wants nor back this is what this is what I'm going to work with I'm going to work with this diagonal I'm going to work with the B file I'm going to work with the slight Pawn imbalance see which pawns go up and that's it and now loic's got to play Fast all right look at look at n Nordy now he's trying to take over the light squares well here L ofic clutch move F5 not allowing nck to walk all over him n weakening his King a little bit but you got to take a little bit of risk Queen goes out to H5 Bishop back to E7 remember Dennis got to play Fast he took that time disadvantage look at that idea by norre rejoining his pawns together to have good light squir control work with that B file he's going to try to grind down the grind master that not the Grand Master but the grind Master that's what denn Dennis lavic is nck looking for any imbalance he can find look at him Night Dancing Night Dancing he grabs the bishop Knight danced all over the board now would grabs the bishop on G6 he's still got over 4minute time advantage on the clock he's the bishop pair the bishop pair as well King G2 now he says take the bishop pair because if you do I'm going to put my Rook here that's an isolated Pawn it's a pawn with no neighbors and I control the square in front of it it's a lone Pawn it's an isolated Pawn lazovic is trying to create counter PL Dennis just in time defending his King reapplying pressure this is a master class in how to apply positional pressure finally another Domino is Fallen but look look at L you got to give credit you got to give credit to Las he's gotten the time advantage to within a minute but nice little zichun zuk in between move and noer is a pawn up and he's looking to convert he's got to defend himself good defense by lavic oh my God the worst Pawn structure of all time for white all pawns are isolated King F3 King E3 but as fate would have it noer would go on to grab as many pawns as he can as he runs out of the casino with all the chips in hand it takes over 60 moves of this game for him to get a decisive Advantage but he gets one and this is over Rook G3 you threaten a check you threaten you threaten to trade the Rooks Rook G8 and the king is stuck King can't get off the a file in time and Nock wins he gets on the scoreboard he lost both matches yesterday I think yes yes he he lost both matches yesterday at zero points so a big start for uh to to the day for him Wesley so Maxim VRA Wesley so lost game one of this match and then he won game two so he lost with white and then he had to win with with black and he did so they go to an Armageddon Wesley starts with 859 on the clock he starts with less than 9 minutes and before the game even started they interviewed him it looked like they were holding him hostage and he was like oh I really regret that Wesley said I really regret that I think I've made a big mistake because now he's down six minutes of the of clock time that's ridiculous and it's in English it's an opening where we're not going to have a lot of Peace trades so Wesley's got a fight back already losing the first game of this match and oh my goodness B4 you can't take that with anything cuz Knight E5 cuz Queen A4 check all sorts of tactical problems all right Knight E1 board opens up and this is really what you want if you're playing an Armageddon okay that you want Total pandemonium you want chaos and that's exactly what Maxim has Maxim has a perfect position for an Armageddon but C5 look at this move you can't take the Knight because of the goofy pin the Queen's unguarded oh my goodness Wesley with a nice defensive resource and Wesley starts chopping down some oh that's a fork out of no from Wesley so he grabs a rook on his way out Bishop F1 and all of a sudden Wesley's doing quite well his Queen is dancing inching forward oh my goodness Maxim opens up Wesley's King Maxim is down a rook Queen F5 though Maxim is is is is got three pawns for The Rook with a big attack but Wesley Bishop C3 defending his King from a distance Queen F6 looking for a queen trade and the dust is going to settle and here comes Wesley's Pawn Wesley gave back a little bit of material but his a pawn is a hero and look at the a pawn go the king is defending himself Maxim gets a rook back but the but the the pawn and Wesley makes a queen and you best a couple of checks later gave a queen he's not going to lose the amazing defense from Wesley so this game goes on a while because Maxim can't resign he can't resign he can't make a draw he can't make a draw because the draw is a win because black started with so so much less time anyway they play they play they play they play they play and uh it actually you know Wesley ends up forcing the draw and he wins Wesley's also 3 and0 Wesley and Magnus at the top of the event which leaves Hikaru versus Ali Resa Hikaru lost both matches yesterday a start to the tournament not a single human on the planet could have expected and he plays a jobava London versus Ali Resa he gets a position that's quite solid though we're not having any kind of goofy stuff little bit later they trade their Bishops and this is what hikaro has to work with he car's lost both matches and he's got no Advantage really to start this this game which is kind of nuts 95 castles and Ali Reza you you remember yesterday Ali Reza went on a big attack against um Fabiano well here Hikaru just he's got a nice position maybe he can play E4 maybe he's going to play Queen B3 but Hikaru does something here that I do not understand I would love to talk to him about this decision he takes the pawn and allows Ali Resa to open up his Rook which just seems like it plays directly into Ali resa's style probably Hikaru I mean there was obviously a reason he did that right like I'm not maybe he just thought F5 was coming like maybe he thought it was going to happen anyway and and all but instead of that he does this and all of a sudden Ali Reza he's got everything he wants this this is Ali Ali resa's bread and butter look at him transferring pieces both guys go under a minute and total pandemonium Breaks Loose Hikaru sends his pieces down the file on the queen side Ali Resa meanwhile defending himself with 10 seconds on the clock and Ali Resa gets a winning position Ali resa is winning because he's guarding against mate and Rook is pressuring Hikaru plays Rook to B1 and apparently black and just start coming down the board but instead Al Resa tries to make something happen and in the Skirmish both guys with 8 seconds on the clock Rook D6 threatening to take and strip the black king completely of defense and it is Hikaru who clutches out a win crashing through Alli resa's pieces getting the queen in the Knight versus the Rooks a completely winning position he wins a tense of fair for Hikaru who wins he beats Ali Resa fuja a monster comeback and he beats him in the match yesterday alza was beating Fabiano so now alza has got as many match wins as hikaro one out of three one out of three for hikaro as well lvic still not on the board Wesley and Magnus 3 and0 Fabiano over there in the mix with everybody as well oh my goodness we go to the second round of the day so Magnus and Wesley are both perfect and in the second game of the day we ended with Magnus and hikaro which I will get to in a second I got to serve you the appetizer first oh my goodness Wesley versus alyza alyza is playing well he's playing playing well he's got winning chances all these matchups but he only has one point to show for it Ali Resa Wesley however is perfect and they went to an Armageddon and Ali Resa out bid Wesley they drew their two rapid games they go to Armageddon and Ali Resa out bids Wesley so so he he starts with 850 E4 E5 Petr wow Ali Resa playing a Petr that is wild this is called the classical variation castles Bishop F5 aggressive play by black brings the bishop back to D s opposite side castling Ali res has got him right where he wants him but he's got him right where he wants him with a 5minute Time disadvantage that's how Armageddon works so H4 H5 look at this aggressive play from Wesley Wesley's winning the tournament he's won every match he's beaten everybody beat Hikaru right he beat NBL he just he just won the earlier round as well I mean he he's on Fire King B1 Bishop F4 Bishop B2 slow play Slow play right oh well now we're not slow playing now the sides are clashing A6 C5 G4 every everybody going Knight F5 takes takes but where's the attack right like Black's Rock Solid you're not going to there's no Pawn you you can use to break through oh oh but that Pawn's really weak out of nowhere Ali res guard's his King but he loses the pawn on D6 so Wesley's now up four and a half minutes on the clock and he's he's got a Pawn on the way out and he's just got to grind this end game down now what Wesley won't do here is play this you don't want the opposite colored Bishops opposite colored Bishops Skyrock at the drawing chances despite the material advantage so Rook to D one Bishop G5 and Oli R is like all right let's go hands like this come get some you get close I'm a duck under I'm going throw you know I'm going throw a hand I'mma throw a kick something and now it's just Ken Wesley turn the screw Knight C6 Bishop F3 applying the pressure Pawn to be oh well it looks like Wesley doesn't have to turn the screw very very much at all those pawns are falling it was uh very difficult to defend this position position because of all the pressure of the Bishops and the game ends on the 28th move there that was the buildup Wesley wins Wesley beat Sal RZA Wesley just beat mvl Wesley beat lvic and Wesley beat hicaro he's 4 and0 winning the he has won every match he's got seven matches to play he's won every match so far this is crazy absolutely nuts this man is crushing he hasn't played uh hasn't played Magnus yet but at this point 4-0 for Wesley so I mean I mean it's just spectacular stuff from this man Resurgence there were crazy other matchups though Maxim versus lavic Dennis lvic and Maxim vrav two draws so lvic is the man like lvic Drew Magnus lavic took a draw off Wesley lavic Drew nck twice he drew mvl twice he goes to an Armageddon mvl out bids him so mv's got black Dennis has to beat mvl Dennis has not won a game in the entire tournament he's making a lot of draws but he hasn't beaten anyone quite yet cuz his he St is a little bit too solid little bit well what perfect what what better way to shed the style than in the Armageddon game against Maxim vilagra and here in one of the most Ultra Uber solid lines of the Queen's gambut accepted frequently goes to an end game where the Queens are traded Dennis lavic plays E4 a Gambit line the idea is Knight E4 and white plays D5 Rook E1 opens up that center of the board to create an attack and mvl does not need two invitations to go party B5 Bishop B7 sharp position white takes the center Knight C3 Knight G5 Dennis lavic is shedding he is going through the metamorph he is shedding the skin of positional play and instead he is look at this man is threatening mate when was the last time Dennis lazic threatened Checkmate on move 12 of a chess game I don't know I don't know who this man is Bishop f8 mv's got to kick him out Queen H3 and look at this on all three sides of the board Dennis lazovic has risen Bishop C2 he completely covers the squares of the king so mvl King is stuck in the center by forcing that move you know black won't Castle Bishop back to F4 Knight D6 is coming queen H7 is coming there's the Knight he bulldozes in that pawn is a massive Thorn the dark squares are completely seized ab ab and Black's position is just not equipped that's not a mouse slipped he's just not equipped to deal with the attack and desperately losing oxygen for these pieces and Dennis lvic breaks Through The Rook is trapped he's going to trap The Rook he wins The Rook he he plays a beautiful clearance sacrifice here to get the D4 square and it was a little bit of an of a shaky conversion a little bit stockfish wasn't fully convinced but he trades Rook A6 and ladies and gentlemen you are looking at your first match winner of the entire event Dennis lazovic swarms mv's King and wins a match he has one point he's on the board and he is tied with a few other people because it is that damn close Dennis lazovic just beat mvl that's crazy oh my goodness he no longer has got the Target on his back he's the lowest rated player everybody's of course looking at Dennis like oh I got you know I got to beat this young man you I got to no no no no and he has made a lot of points in his matches now another match from this round Fabiano versus Nock who are now on totally different planets because Fabiano yesterday was 2-0 and he just lost to Magnus in that brutal game I showed you that was a tough game so he's looking to bounce back versus nck nck was 0 and2 on day one and he just beat lavic in a beautiful end game so this one we have a we have an Italian we have an usbeck was that cuz he's from usbekistan Knight D5 Knight to B4 and the position gets traded very solid position white has the two Bishops Rook is going to go here Queen is going to come out you see both guys clearly in prep nobody really thinking a whole lot right C3 and Fabiano is going to go to work he is going to go to work but norre says Fab you can't play B4 can't can't do much all right G3 Bishop C5 all right nice and solid both guys bringing the Rooks good pressure you know Bishop C1 all right all right now nb's asking a couple questions here about the white position what's white going to do how's he going to defend against F2 Rook D1 all right Rook d8 very tense but like nobody can really break through and then start going like some weaknesses here could be developing a little bit of who's going to guard this guy oh no nobody nobody's going to okay nobody we just letting okay fine he's getting taken Knight goes back to G6 Knights versus Bishops I mean traditional wisdom tells you white should be better here but black is so solid he controls this you know the Knight is solid on the D5 Square so I mean this is okay well well I mean Fab is looking it's a very tense position and then Fabby takes the Knight he really didn't like that Knight but now F's got an isolated Pawn which is protected by his Bishop but that's a bit of a weakness as well and look at the time Fabby clearly frustrated he can't break through down five minutes and my friends Nock Abdus satov begins consolidating and completely preventing Fabby from breaking through but Fabby starts repositioning and he gets that pawn but that's not that's not that's not going to cut it because suddenly White's King is wide open the queen takes the pawn back the bishop is hanging that's a threat oh my goodness it is brutal stuff here Rook on D3 F's down to 30 seconds he has 30 seconds on the clock and he has to he has to give up a queen queen C1 Desperado sacrificing the queen and getting it back and black is winning the worst nightmare comes true nerb defends perfectly and Fabiano has not gotten over the Tilt from the previous matchup this might be a draw like there are some drawing chances here sometimes this is a fortress there's a way to like not lose this but he gets the Rook to the perfect square and that's it he breaks apart White's Fortress and this one takes 84 moves and Fabiano Carana goes down in two games nck wins both his matchups on the second day of the event and Fabiano loses both of his matchups on the second day of the event losing to Magnus not crazy A crazy Tale of Two matchups and now it's is the Marquee matchup Magnus carlsson Fabian uh Fabiano Nakamura that's a that's and here it is two rapid games and an Armageddon if they need it this is a big match up this is not the finals but it's a big one because Magnus is three and0 Hikaru just beat Ali RZA can he bring some of that momentum oh yeah game one Hikaru shows up with a mirrored Queen's Gambit find me the last time in a serious event rapid classical that happened that looks like a a mouse flip I mean this just looks like two 500s you know I mean at this point we might as well do this I guarantee some of you bozos watching this video have done this with your friends all right a mirrored Queen's Gambit and it works to Perfection Magnus gets caught off guard he tries to create like just a solid structure but Hikaru develops all his pieces and then Magnus plays an inaccurate move here the computer is just saying you got to play Bishop E3 you got to slow play it Magnus tries to make something happen right now Hikaru spends 6 minutes but gets out of Dodge and Bishop F3 clutch move E4 it looks like white black is just falling apart with the king in the center but it's just it black is quick gets the king castled and everything flies off the board and that's it Magnus has nothing in game one nothing completely out prepared completely caught off guard we rarely see that but a clutch opening decision from hikaro get Magnus gets nothing absolutely nothing Knight C3 look at this fancy move hits the queen with both pieces grabs his Bishop that's it game is over effortless game from hikaro a beautiful surprise weapon we still get an end game some pieces get traded but you you best believe these guys aren't going to lose this Hikaru very Savvy here by the way making sure that despite being a pawn down he gets the Rooks to the there's nothing you can do white can play Rook B4 white can win all the pawns but there there's nothing because black is too very very smart by the way look at this just making sure he doesn't get mated but if you get your Rook successfully to your opponent's second rank in a rook end game it's like it it's like a paper shredder I mean you just and there we go and you know Magnus is real good but he's he's not beating he's not beating Hikaru in this end game he might not even beat me in this end game I mean he probably will more often than he you know beats iaru but this is a very tough end game to lose with black or with white you would lose it with both colors but that's besides the point and the players make a draw excellent game one now Hikaru game number two with the white pieces plays my favorite he's been he's been busting this out all tournament I got to give the man props Bishop F6 all right super imbalanced opening Bishop B4 Magnus you know like applying the pressure uh from the early stage I mean queen B6 it really Hikaru is just getting the castle safely but Magnus has the nice two Pawns in the center two Bishops hikaru's opening gamble here not quite paying off as much as it did last time it's it's easier to succeed with an opening gamble when you play black than it is with white but now the good news for Hikaru is he can always bail out that's the thing like worse comes to worse it's going to be minus point2 but he grabs the bishop opposite colored Bishops Five Pawns each these guys are really really good iaru repositioning his Bishop gets the king out of the pin and now it's time to trade and um yeah we're going to an Armageddon I think it's I think you can tell both guys strong nothing to choose between them between in these two rapid games we go to Armageddon one funny thing about the Armageddon Hikaru wagered a certain amount of time Magnus wagered 15 minutes Magnus turned over the piece of paper it's a tissue he turn it'd be weird if he was carrying a tissue around and it said 15 this man unless I misread that but I saw it I I I was out at the time I could be completely wrong I thought an image was shared so Magnus uh says I want white Hikaru Wagers 940 so Magnus just gives Karu black which which was kind of like a power move a little bit he says I just want white and I think I'm going to win which is Gangster until move three hearu plays the Damiano a second time this man just played the same thing that he played against mvl this is a mirror image Petro this used to be thought of as like a bozo opening because after Queen E2 black loses the queen but with the invention of computers Queen E2 is actually not as good as we once thought black can equalize maybe but Magnus just says you know what I don't want any of that garbage I don't want any of that garbage Bishop D3 Bishop D6 he just gets a completely symmetrical position Magnus says all right good job you surprised me now you got to prove it C5 from Hikaru C4 kicking out magnus's Bishop Knight C6 Bishop E6 and the sides have reached a position of stability now Magnus has to win how's he going to do it B3 begins prying apart hikaru's position gets rid of the pawn hikaro pins him Magnus goes for the bishop hikaro takes okay Bishop pair but now hikaro is going to trade magnus's other Bishop so Magnus won't have any Bishop pair take take take take okay karo's got the active Queen he's got an isolated Pawn but he's got good pressure idea over here all right Rook e one gets the queen out of Dodge Magnus a he SP three minutes on that move Magnus doesn't even have a Time Advantage anymore oh my God this worked perfectly for Hikaru they're both got they both got just under 5 minutes this is incredible there's no Advantage anymore Knight E4 and Magnus here finds the Nifty Knight takes C6 the idea is that if you take my queen I check and then I go here that was the idea and then maybe I can push your king back but the computer says this is equal not only does it say that that idea is you know possible but it says there's nothing special about it and Hikaru should go for this end game plant that Knight there and then while Magnus tries to remove it he will pressure this he's going to play F6 King F7 that's how he's going to bring it but Hikaru kind of believes him and he kind of says you know what fine BC I'm not going to take the queen I'm not going for any of that stuff my knight is better than your Bishop but now he gives Magnus a small imbalance and Magnus goes god mode Queen A5 F3 kicking out the Knight centralization of the Rook now now hikaru's got to take on passive defense but we've been here before hikaru's done the shoulder rolls the Philly shell all right the Box in comparison with chess rookie six he's not letting Magnus through but in this position Hikaru feeling the pressure mounting should have played something like Queen E7 even this apparently losing this Pawn is fine I I don't know why you would ever do that but Hikaru goes here in the tensest moment of the game and suddenly the dark squares are fatally weak apparently he had to just not touch the gon but the pressure was building and in the critical moment Magnus seizes control of the game he is forcing hikaru's King out and now he's grabbed the pawn and it's bad news Queen C7 King H2 Magnus dominating the dark squares don't rush with the trade Bishop F4 he's going to get the bishop to G5 no he's not no he's not wait a minute wait a minute oh now F4 and that's going to do it because when you get rid of that pawn you have the past H Pawn Magnus now just brings the king back King F3 and that's it he's going to get that and and hearu resigns Hikaru just resigns because he's two pawns down in an end game and Magnus Carlson wins against Hikaru and finishes the day 4 and0 ridiculous absolutely that was a vintage Magnus game that you got to give credit to Hikaru who started the game down 5 minutes and managed to get to a position where it was equal I mean it was equal Magnus was still the one calling the shots but oh my goodness what a fight and these are your standings after four rounds of action if it ended right now Magnus and Wesley move on to the semi-finals automatically nerc Fabiano Dennis La Dennis lazik and Maxim Vash lra would play amongst each other hikaro and alzo would be going home because of the match points Dennis lavc has more match points than the other guys crazy I think this is accurate so Hikaru and alza have three rounds remaining to change these standings that is nuts that is so so so close I will see you all tomorrow shout out to hkar once again for sponsoring the video you can check out their Link in the description guys this is what an event this is nuts pandemonium we have two more round robin Recaps to go and a survival stage Champions Chester finals I hope you're enjoying get out of here
