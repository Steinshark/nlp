- We bought a bus and now we're turning
it into a battle bus. And then we're going to surprise
Tfue with the battle bus. And to prove I'm not lying, this is Tfue's brother right here. Dude, it's going to be hyped, I can't wait to give it to him. All right, J followers, we made a Fortnight battle bus and we're going to go give it to Tfue. Only thing is Tfue lives
about 20 hours away, so yeah, this is going to be interesting, 'cause this bad boy can
only go 45 miles an hour. - That's downhill. - Downhill? - Yep. - Even better. Hey, come check out our battle bus. Come here guys. All right. So, first things first,
we've got a PlayStation. Only game on the PlayStation is Fortnite. That's all Tfue can play. - Only thing. - Yep. He definitely
doesn't do anything else. We got a futon right here. - Oh yeah. - It looks really comfortable. We got a little carpet. We got some lighting and
then we got a desk right here for him to play Fortnite again. 'Cause again, I'm pretty
sure that's all Tfue does. Whoa, that's pretty cool. We got bunk beds. Can you actually get on that top bunk? - Yeah, yeah. Why not? Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. I just wanted
confirmation it works. Guys, the battle bus is all decked out. And Tfue's brothers Joogsquad's going to help us surprise him. - He's going to freak out. - It's a battle bus that's completely decked out on the inside. - You better ask us where we're jumping. - Where are we jumping boys? - Chris, would you live in this bus? - I would love to have
this as like a camper. - I don't think you understand, I'm stealing this from Turner. - Yeah. - My home after this. You did a good job. - Well, you guys did a good job. - Hey! - Good job Jake. - All right guys, let's go surprise Tfue with this battle bus. - Yeah! Hey wait, where's Chris? - Wait for me. - Chris, come on. - Wait for me. - We're just driving
down the road and dude, this does not feel like
we're in a bus right now. We got to have a Fortnite dance off. Chris, hit us. - All right. - Oh. All right, all right. Jake, hit us, hit us. - Oh, doing the twist. - Ooh. Okay. - I'm going to fall. - Jack, what you got in your sleeve? - Oh, oh, okay. Okay, okay, yeah. Okay, okay. - I think Chris won, hands down, so. - I should have gone with the floss. - All right. We might have
forgot to attach that. - Just jump out and do it real quick. - All right. - Are you really? - Yeah. We got to attach it son! Open the door. Open the door! - We forgot to attach the hood. - Good. We're good. - The other side isn't. Close it, close it, close it, close it. - Close the door! - Chris, you know what that window's made of in front of you, right? - Good. Wouldn't be a battle bus
without a little nudity. - To Walmart. Thank you bus driver. , tell Chris he's an idiot. He didn't thank the bus driver. - Oh Chris! - You uncultured swine. - I don't play much Fortnite. - Thank you. - Yeah. Thank you. We took a short cut. - Oh look, there's an actual battle bus. - Yeah. - Bro, this looks sick! - Dude. I cannot wait
to see how Tfue reacts. So we're out here in the battle bus, we're driving down the highway and what better to do in the
battle bus than play Fortnite? - It really wants me to add friends but I don't have any friends. - I don't have any friends either. I just have you. - I'm not your friend. - Oh. - We're your friends. - Jack's my friend. - Excuse me. - Thank you Jack, for
being my only friend. - Thank you Jack. - Excuse me. - You know there's no one else there. - Yeah. - Yeah, no one else
starts with the letter J. Dude, you're from like the 12 hundreds. - I'm jumping off the bus. - Go ahead and jump out. - All right, bet. We're jumping boys. - Thank you. - All right, thank God we got rid of them. - Woo! - Let's go pee! - Yeah, I really have to pee. And we still got a long time. - Hey, donate to my stream. - We're all going to look up and then see if Devin looks up confused. Watch. We're pulled over on the side of the road. We're like five hours in, right? - Yeah, it's kinda late. - Might have a flat. Let's fix it before we give it Tfue. - Pee while we're here. - Get off the road! - We're good. Whoa! - We're about two hours away, Jake challenged me to a game of checkers, we're betting $100. Question to viewers, do you see what the great move is? And now you physically can't move. Are you really going to make me do this? - All right, you owe
Jimmy a hundred bucks. - Never doubted you. He said he would win, he didn't. Tfue actually has no idea that
we're even coming down here. We've spent the last 24 hours in this bus, driving down the east coast
and he doesn't even know, so. - It's been a really smooth ride though. - Yeah, it definitely haven't
been bumping the entire time. I look like I'm going to war. - 'Cause your wearing green. - Yeah. Now we're FaceTiming Tfue. Hey, so we're coming to your house, we're about 10 minutes
away from your house, so just make sure you're ready for us. - What do you mean? - Just, we'll be there in 10 minutes. We got a giant present for you. - All right. - All right, I'll see you in 10 minutes. All right, he has no
idea what we're doing. - Hey, you see his face now, imagine his face when he's the bus. - I called him on Jack,
his brother's phone, so he was expecting his
brother and then he got me. And I was just like, hey,
I'll be there in 10 minutes. And he was like, okay. So we're about to surprise Tfue, but some of his friends are here and let's see what they think. What do you think of the bus? - This is insane. - Yeah? All right J, let's go knock on his window. All right, we're in Tfue's
backyard. Keep going. I just knock. We have a present we want to give you - What's up, man? - You should win the game first and then we should give you the present. - All right. It's only right. I set it up, I get the turrent ready and I think Mr Beast
should just lay him out. - Ooh! - There you go dog. It's all you. - There he is bro, right click stayed yes. - There you go, it's going to restart. - Yep, yep. No, no! Oh! - Let's crowd surf this man out of here. - my camera. - You came behind, and we'll . - All right, boys. - All right. - Who's heard of a two man crowd surf? - I don't know, dude. - I'm going to slip here. - I got you. - Put him down, put him down. - All right, take it off. - Bro, what? A battle bus? - All right. Come see this, it looks
so good on the inside. - Bro! What? Dude! My new house. - Your own battle bus. - Oh my God. Holy. This is nuts. Let's go drive it, dude. Boys. Oh. All the ladies going
to be up in here, boys. That's what I'm talking about. - We got pig axis for you, costumes dude. - Of course he picks the default, dude. - Of course. - You guys really bought and
brought a battle bus here. - Yes. - So the biggest thing was, last time we came here you gave
us our snack, or your snack. - Oh, so most importantly,
we had to repay you so. Here's some snacks back. - Oh . - Since you gave us some last time. And then on top of that, a
battle bus to repay you for them. - Thank you guys. - Yeah, no problem, man. - Oh, that's what it's
all about right there. - Yeah, man. - I lived in this thing the last two days. - Yeah, literally. - Do we have everyone
pile in and go for a ride? - Let's do it. - Drive. - Yep. - Oh God. - Who wants the grand prize? - Oh my God. - We're surviving so far. - Where's the horn? Does it have a horn? - Try pushing harder, I don't know. Yeah! Turners streaming right now. - Hey, cut to Turners stream right now. You got to- - Holy , I told you, don't get close. - Ow! - The breaks are touchy. - Don't let Tfue drive your battle bus. - Easy. Easy. - Is this your first
time ever driving a bus? - Yes. - You only slightly injured half of us. So that's pretty solid. - The first time ever drove
a bus was a battle bus, so. That's pretty legendary. - Well look, he has 63,000 viewers and we stole him. - That's amazing. - We should just donate and be like, sorry we took your master. - Sorry, we took him. - We stole Tfue, sorry. - Having a lot of faith in the TV. Everything's coming up blocked. - It's fine. - I just want to say if I die, give all my subscribers to PewDiePie. - Where's Jack? - There he is, right there. You should pick him. - Open the door. - Get in while I'm going. - Get in! Get in! - Go, go, go. We got him! - You're getting pro at that bro. - I'm a pro now, dude. - With a pick ax? - With a pick ax. All right Jimmy, your turn. - No, I would die. Quick update, Tfue still
has 18,000 viewers, just his chair. - We're jumping boys! Go jump in! - Dude, only mild cuts, nice. - Thank you. - Oh, you did it with jeans on bro. - Yeah, I know, that's
why those were good. - Oh, that's why you're struggling. - Well, I took them off,
but then I was like, what if I lose my underwear? - Yeah! - That was fun. - Sketchy. - There's a cop. There's a cop. - Oh great. - Oh boy. - Jack. - Are you guys done for the day? - Yeah. - Are you guys done? - Yeah. - Going somewhere else? - Yeah. - Why are you stopped in the road? Blocking traffic. You jumped off and get sucked
out because of the current, that's what happened, we have people watching you guys man. You can't just jump over the side, you know that, I know
you're doing your stunts and your pranks- - Dude, we're not from here. We're meeting people who are here. - Joogsquad. - Yeah. - He's from here. He knows better. - Okay. Well we- - This isn't our first rodeo man. - Yo, did you get a ticket? - No. - No, all right! - Dude, he was like, y'all know it's against the law and I was like, we're from north con and he goes, that's Joogsquad, ain't it? And I was like, . He goes, I know what y'all are doing. He knows the rules. And I was like- - What a man. Thank you, officer, kind officer. Hey, content. - Did you ask him if he wanted to ride in the battle bus? - No, he was pissed. - Oh really? - He was pissed. - If they were going to
give you guys a ticket, you should just drove it off the bridge and be like, that. We're going to to wrap it up here. Thank you for helping us. - Of course. - Appreciate it. - Thank you guys. - Thanks to Jake, you did a lot on this and how you like the bus? You love it? - I love it, dude. Thank you so much for the battle bus dude. I can't wait to drive it straight

one more important thing, if you have Amazon Prime, use your free Twitch prime sub on Tfue, let's double his subscriber account. Come on. You're like a nine year old kid, you can afford that. - I need Prime subs. But if you do want to use code Tfue in the bottom right corner of
the items shop, its up to you. - All of it, yeah. And while you're at it, just follow him, give him your mom's life
savings, everything. All right, I'll see you guys later - We're driving a booty bus. - Thank you bro. - Yeah. - I love this guy. - So, does January 1st
