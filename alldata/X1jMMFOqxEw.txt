- We are playing hide
and seek for $50,000. There's 10 of them. The last one found gets
the $50,000 in cash. You have 20 minutes to hide. - What? - 19 minutes to hide. - That would be a second. - Whoever's found last
gets to keep the money. I don't care who it is. - Let's do this. (tense music) - I don't know if I
want to be with people, or away from everyone. I don't know which one's
more nerve-wracking. - Oh, I got to poop. I got to poop. This is not the time. - So I woke up this morning, grabbed 10 of my friends and $50,000, and told them to hide. That's the extent of my day. I wonder where Chandler's hiding. - Alright, I'm going
to go poop real quick. Dude, this door doesn't lock. Are you kidding me? - This building has hundreds of rooms, and thousands of hiding spots. So, there's no way I
can find them on my own. So me and Chris are going
to be working together. We need to devise a strategy, Chris. You should use your eyes. And I use my eyes. - That sounds like a solid plan. - Let's do it. - I wonder who has the
dumbest hiding spot? - I'm hiding in a theater. It's like high school all over again. - Sh, no one will know. - Me and Jake are currently
hiding in the catwalk. - We both showed up at the same time. We're just going to be here together. - So there's this treasure chest. I can hide in this. I'm going to hunker down and
stay in here for a while. Bye, guys. - We got rid of the ladder. So there's no way to tell where we are. We are up here. We did it. We did it. - Guys, you can walk away with $50,000 or nothing. - There are one minutes left. Remember Chandler, you can't get out until we start the challenge. Dab! - One minute left guys. Wish me luck. - I'm a student here. So I know all of the hiding spots. The good ones that is. - 30 seconds. - 30 seconds, me and Ben found a spot. If they tell us to move, we're going to go our separate ways. But, until then, right here, this is a good spot. - So, what do you think about this spot? - [Cameraman] It's a good spot. - Pretty good?
(horn blaring) - Time's up. Ready or not, here we come. I think a good strategy would be to just walk down all the hallways, and then afterwards we
go in all the rooms. - Okay. Oh, that would be a great hiding spot. - Wait, Tareq. Someone's in here. - [Tareq] Wait, what? - Got him. - There's 10 people, and we haven't found anyone yet. (tense music) Alright, this is the basement. We're going to start with this room, and we're going to work our
way along all the rooms. Whoever's in this room. You're done. I think there's someone
in that corner back there. - [Chris] Oh, man. Dude, look at this place. - No freaking way! - We found Chandler.
- No! - Alright, come on, Chandler. You have to go to jail. - Am I the first one? - Yes you are.
- You really are the first one out.
- You're the first one out! - You were the first one found, you must now spend the night in jail. I am happy to report that
Chandler has been found. Nine to go. - You hide in plain sight, and it doesn't work. - One down! Nine more to go! We're coming for you! This building has a movie theater in it, and we're only on the second floor. - [Chris] There's so many
places to hide in here. - I guarantee you there's someone hiding in one of these seats. - I found a ladder. - This building is huge. Thought for sure someone would be up here. - Honestly, it's a
miracle we're still here. - They were about to take both of us out. - [Tareq] Oh, we're on
the third floor guys. - Somehow we went up a floor. - Abracadabra.
- Nope. - [Woman] Thank you for
calling Jimmy John's. - Can I make an order for delivery? Yes. I'm starving. (door bell rings) Thank you so much. Thank you, this is amazing. Let's go. - Jimmy and Chris are right beside me. - Take this off. Is there a way to get in it? - He literally hit the box I'm in. And said there's no way to get in. - Ah! We never checked this ballroom. - Wow, you could have a lot of balls in this ballroom. (man laughing) - Wait a second, I hear something. It's just me winning $50,000. I'm sorry. - What in the world, dude?
- How did you know about this? - Thought for sure someone
would be hiding in here. Whoa, what is this? - [Chris] You want me to check it out? - Dude!
- We just found a secret crevice. - [Tareq] Dude! - Ty, no! (Tyson screams) - Come on. Let's go to jail, Ty. Dude, yes. Another contestant has fallen. Only eight remain. All right, Chandler, we brought you a friend. All right, Ty. Into- - [Tareq] Ooh, jail broke. - I was talking mad junk too, y'all.
- I thought you were in a good spot. - I thought I had it too, man.
- Man. - Alright, we're back. This thing's like 400 pounds. I got three of them, you want want one? (walkie talkie ringing) - My hypothesis is either
Tyler, Jake, or Garrett is constantly calling us. - They're probably trying
to find our location. - [Tareq] Saw someone run across. Like, run run. Saw someone run across. Like, run run - Let's go. - [Tareq] Oh, here he is. Where's he going? We lost Chris. - He's probably got to take the stairs. Oh, we're going to get him. As soon as this elevator door closes. We're coming after you, over and out. Let's do this. - It's only 50 grand. It's not like I got
bills to pay or anything. - I'm going to go probe
Chandler for some info. Hey Chandler, can you gimme some info? Give me a little scoop. - What are you looking for? - Not like a giant scoop, a small scoop. One that sinks in the cone. Is it up or down? - What floor are we on?
- Two. (all laughing) - Roger, I got the inside scoop. - What do I get? - I'll think about it. Chris? Chris? Chris? He might already be on the move. - I starve. We are going to find a new spot. Is someone by any chance
hiding under your desk? Have to check. Okay, you're clear. Chris! This is a big room. Someone's got to be in here. Not there. Not there. Yeah, no. No one's up there. Just checked up here. - What do you think we can do in here? I'm going to get behind here. - We just discovered a brand new area. I didn't even know this was here. These are motion sensor bathrooms. This motion sensor was already triggered, when we came down the hallway. - I can currently hear Jimmy. He's coming. This is it. - [Tareq] We're in the fridge. - [Jimmy] I found you!
- Ah! - Yes! Yes!
- No! Alright, here you go. - [Tareq] How does it feel guys? - It feels great, honestly.
- [Tareq] (laughing) Yeah. - Oh yeah, dude. - Oh, I heard that. - Came from the air vent. - You do that again, you're kicked out. - How have we not found Viking yet? - I know. - He's huge. - But to be fair, we haven't even gone in every room yet. Because we really need to find people, I'm going to have to play a cheat card. You all have to move to a different floor than you currently are on, within the next 10 minutes. We are going to be scouring. I'll even give you a hint. We're currently on the second floor. Good luck! - That was less of a hint, and more of an exact location, but I like your style. - Alright, so I'm on the way. I got my YouTooz that I found. I got to get to a different floor. Jimmy just radioed us, and told us that we have
to go to a different floor. - What if we found
someone in the elevator? - That would be hilarious.
- [Tareq] Just waiting. - It took a while to get up here. It was at the basement, too. It's not opening. Somebody's in it. Go, go, go, go, go. Go! Follow him! - There's a bottle of water. Somebody got thirsty. I got to be ready to sprint. Wrong way. (intense music) (all laughing) - Darn it. - Dude, I heard someone
coughing in the elevator. It stopped on this floor. (tense music) - [Chris] Gotcha! - Yo, what the heck, how'd you see me? - [Chris] Garrett has been found. I repeat, Garrett has been found. - Welcome to prison. - So we have to think about it. Marcus is smaller. He can fit in smaller spaces. - Uh-huh, huh, hooah. Dude, I'm calling it. (Jimmy gasps) Hold up, hold up. - [Chris] No freaking
way. Someone was in here. - [Tareq] No freaking way!
- I bet you they were in here when we checked. - No! - Jimmy and Chris are right beside me. - When we went to move that earlier, it was heavy. Moving it just then, was like a feather. There was someone in there earlier. We're running out of time. We need to do something. Do you think we pull
another double whammy? Hut ha hike four 20? Attention, we are definitely
running out of time, and there's still a lot of you left. So, I'm gonna need you guys to go to a floor that
you are not currently on. You have 10 minutes. Good luck. They're probably all on the move. Let's do it. - [Tyler] Hi. I thought you were Chris. That's why I was hiding. You know they're gonna wait in the stairs. I'm winging it, dude. I'm literally just trying
to be lucky at this point. - [Viking] Me too. - My current hiding spot might be the brightest spot in this whole place. I had no idea where to go. - That light was on. Now we play the waiting game. - We're moving. Someone called the elevator. We're going to the basement. (Tyler yells) - Why did you go elevator? - Oh, we got both-
- Why did you go elevator? - Oh! No! Two at a time. Oh my God. - They were having a special, we got two for one! - There are currently six people in jail, which means there's only four of you left. Only one of you, are going to walk away with $50,000. So I hope you guys hide well. - By finding this YouTooz, you're now awarded two grand, again. Four grand off of these YouTooz. Oh, Jimmy I give up. Syke, it's about to be 54 grand. And I'm about to hide in these chairs. You think he's going to
look for me down here? This is pretty risky. See you later. - How graceful was that shuffle though? I mean, come on - We have a dilemma. We have one hour left
with this giant building, and there's four people that remain. I think we need to devise a plan. What if we told them all
to go to a single floor. To the four of you that remain, we have about an hour left. We need to spice some things up. So we're going to limit the range to two floors. You have 10 minutes to get
to floor two and three, and you need to hide on those two floors. - They just told me to move floors. So we are on the second floor right now. We're actually going to go back up to that third floor spot in the theater. - So Jimmy's having a
hard time finding us. So we have to move. - I found my new hiding spot. Floor three, in the theater. It is very, very dark back here. They could overlook me. I hope they do. - We can do this. I believe in us. - I don't. These people are really good at hiding. - Let's go back to the theater. Someone's definitely in here. - Dang it. - [Craig] No!
- Ah, Craig. No!
- [Jimmy] He found someone, he found someone!
- [Jacob] No! I'm so disappointed. - [Chris] That was a good spot though. - [Jimmy] Hey.
- [ Chris] Oh looks like you got some YouTooz back there. - Oh yeah. - Let me see, nice.
- I got Chandler. - Oh, you know what the best thing to do with Chandler's YouTooz is. - [Tareq] Wow. - Buy my YouTooz, it's better. - He said it. - I was in the chest. - You! You! - I called it. I said it was Jacob. - We have a new friend for you. (all yelling) - Three more. Let's scare them off. - Ah!
- Ah! - Oh, there's Chris again. What a loud boy. - We found Jacob, so
only three of you remain. - Jimmy just said on the radio that it's only three of us remaining. I think I got a really good hiding spot. It's kind of like behind some blinds. - [Chris] Somebody just ran from me, but I couldn't see who it was. All I saw were shoes. - [Jimmy] I'm coming, I'm coming. - [Chris] Oh, no! - [Jimmy] What? Who'd you find? - [Chris] Marcus, I found you Marcus. - [Jimmy] Marcus, no. He literally goes, "Marcus, I'm sorry." And then I just see you just bolted. We found a new member, come on in. - No!
- Oh! - [Tareq] Oh my god. - I just want to win my first challenge. - Wipe your tears, son. - [Tareq] Dude, you almost had it. - It's not my fault. It's just the name of the game. Your hair's so soft. - There's two people left. - Jake Weddle and Ben Malone. - We found Marcus, which means two of you remain. Mr. Weddle, Mr. Ben, you two are now competing for $50,000. - I hope I win this thing. I really do. - I'm not getting found. I am taking that money. - Now since there's only two of you left, you both have to migrate
to the third floor. First one found loses, and the other one will get $50,000. - They're confining it to the third floor. I'm on the third floor. So I don't have to move anywhere. - My battery's almost dead. I'm on the move. I am out in the open. I am exposed right now. - We are now ascending from
the second floor to the third. Where Ben and Jake reside. Let's start off here. We're going to do a sweep. We're going to hit every room, and work our way around. (dramatic music) - [Chris] Oh, I see him! Weddle, no! I saw you! - Alright, go that way,
I'm going this way. Weddle, no. Weddle. - I've known all along. I'm so tired. I haven't eaten since 3:00 PM. - Jake, your fly is also down. Not to add insult injury.
- [Tareq] Look! - Let's not tell Ben. - [Tareq] Should we just go home? Forget about Ben. - [Chris] Yeah, I think we
should probably just head home. - [Ben] What up? - Dude, that's such a good spot! - Ben, come on out.
- [Weddle] Hey, Ben. - [Chris] How good is that spot? - Prisoners, the winner of the $50,000 game of hide and seek, is Ben! (all cheering) We need to let Weddle into prison. - Where I belong! This is what prison's like, kids. - Alright, Ben. Now I'm gonna awkwardly hand you the money in front of everyone. Maybe you should buy them some stuff. I don't know. Subscribe. I hope you enjoyed. Goodbye.
- I had such a good time. And now I'm gonna be able to actually give my family and everything a good Christmas. You know, really exciting. - [Tareq] Well Ben, congratulations. Enjoy your 50 grand. - Thanks, man.
