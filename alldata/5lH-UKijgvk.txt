but I also want to quickly say something about you know how do you submit the talk for the new speakers um also just have for the folks in hobilo there's some ports which you can uh take so I just launched two new polls um and so how do you submit a talk to me DC plus there's two URLs one is to submit the Talk itself and the conference URL this before this has started and similar for other conferences right now cppcon also has their code for talks and other conferences are going to happen over summer and then they're going to have that similar process for them and it's not like that we have like a standard here it's like oh everyone is doing it slightly different um they're going to have that next year and so this is of course a bit opinionated of a lot of things I say so take this as a grain of sort okay um first yeah create an account um that's most most of the submission systems today's are account based um of course subscribe to my newsletter and to the weekly block role where I share all the block links with you every week um and then you need to submit your talk and the first thing you will do is to fill out your speaker bio um quickly want to go through for some of those things we actually have now a review group so if you want to help review talks or just see what other people write in their talk descriptions um join the group and um in this box is your speaker bio which of course is the most important part and want to point out if you want to add a link that's the symbol a lot of people seems to know to know that um and the picture of you when you submit a talk is optional uh when your talk is selected for the conference of course it's not as optional anymore um and now you're ready to submit your talk so let's break this up this form as you just saw um let's go for the talk Title First keep your talk title short there's some people there's like really like to have talk titles which are like you know container comma and a complete different sentence after it it's too long I don't include subtitles um I think it's like for for technical reasons it's probably in our world better to avoid certain characters and titles like you know especially commas semicolons and other stuff if you don't absolutely have to have that and in your talk description Network title don't do that um reasons are like HTML entity conversion etc etc okay um exceptions like yeah C plus is fine and if you have to have it and you talk Etc that's fine just want to take the note good titles are engaging so how to and and so on uh using C plus plus 20 23 17 11 14 26 um for what you do memes can work introduction overviews and tutorials can this you know say what they are introduction into writing application with lip and GUI or lip boost cute Etc um I also want to point out that well-known speakers get a various talk title that are sometimes questionable or maybe not as good for you as a new speaker because a lot of people will judge the talk by the new title by the pilot title if they don't know the speaker already and sometimes speakers just get away with a bad title or it was a catchy title because they're already well known and they already you know get the um get the points for having done lots of good talks and being a good speaker huh so if you're new to speaking pay attention to your talk title and um just because you know the big and your your speaker idle the speakers which you salvaged your favorite as you think are really good um they might not be the best orientation for you in regarding to to for the title um top description um is yeah what you're talking about you should add here more than a paragraph also it's not a blog post so don't put too much into it um again there's a possibility to actually put a really physical HTML link into here and be aware that if you're copy pasting this from some other source your copy pasting artifacts from like Word documents Etc into this um that is why I highlighted here this um symbol which is the HTML code which is which is uh control will generate and there you will be able to see like if you have any inline CSS or hello things and other Shenanigans um in there and also this is the way to put your code into pre uh Snippets okay um into pre-tax that's the way how to present code on my platform and when I was too um the outliners how to how do you envision your talk I often put slide talk titles in here another Skillet too um what people should know about you or this token specific which isn't on the top description maybe also stuff you don't want to put in the talk description because it's important for the talk but for for people reviewing your the free text form you can put in what whatever you want to put in there but it's visible to the reviewers and voters on my platform um the attendees never gonna see it when they're not participating in the voting and if they participated in the voting they're not gonna remember it ideas Etc is just an open field now what I'll find out is a lot of people seem to fill out this and and you then should revisit after filling out the outline your talk description because the most popular feedback I have given to speakers last year was your outline contains the second or third paragraph of your talk description just in bullet points you know that's just that's something like which you put in your in your outline which is great that you mentioned that but that should also be in your talk description um that's the the best thing we learned last year through the review system that a lot of speakers um should review their talk description after doing the outline um the audience is something we cover to to have that um who should come to your talk orientation or combinations make sense give people an orientation of the level of your talk that's that's what this is about um there's four more options which I quickly want to cover as a conference organizer it's important to me that we have some talks which are like new or not has been at every conference already so if your talk is like new and you prepared for the conference if you don't submit it to another conference in front of me in C plus plus and you're really like saying well this is the one talk I have and this is I I want to go to Berlin and speak at the median C plus plus and present this talk as new that's what this is about and it's also important for as an organizer to me to know this it's also going to be displayed in the voting as far as I know and we'll give you maybe a little bit of an edge if you're like preparing a new talk um and I already mentioned the the review system we have in place so if you want to have your uh review and like feedback on your talk then check this um meaning C plus plus supports up to two speakers so if you have a second speaker check this box and it triggers the second speaker bio form in the next form and you will be able to enter the name email and the bio and yeah so we have an online only track which is pre-recorded as I already mentioned prior um that's what this box is for to tell us this um and as I said it's if if you want a comfortable then you don't have to do that but there's no on-site only box because that would be too much um everyone may speak online I understand that some some speakers don't want to speak online but if your talk doesn't get accepted and we still have open slots in the online track some people might want to go for it on the other hand there are speakers which are not able to come to building which I already mentioned uh prior to um and they may you know want to indicate that this talk is for the online audience and that they were prepared or do the pre-recordings and in that case um that gives a huge Edge for uh your talk and also helps us to select the talks for the online presence of the conference and last but not least of course submit your talk um and quickly mentioning again that of course there's a login you're able to edit it and let's also like one thing which I find that is important because you submit your talk on the next day you will find something or you will have a shower thoughts and in the next week to something to add something to change um and we are able to give you feedback and you you'll be able to edit the talk and the way we do that um so that's good the next steps from our site then is once a call for talks has ended which is 26th of June uh one week about one week you'll be able to edit your submission then the Voting is where you know the token for this process is visible to most voting folks foremost speakers and some other folks in my team sees other speaker and photo that we have you know balance set in the voting and then the selection is Guided by the track for the voting results last year was specialized at 10 years and hybrid we hybrid this year again but we have more tracks on site actually this uh years conference is pretty much modeled after last year's conference because it was quite a good success and what we kept for this year and um so this year's not as special but really started you know kind of uh not as Limited in the space due to the pandemic anymore so if you want to come to Berlin you're welcome and I'm looking really forward to see many of you there um I know that thanks for listening um submit your talk until June 26th on the website on some pages it still still says June 18th deadline I haven't announced that officially that this is now moved to June 26th uh due to my holiday being longer yeah so um that's something which I will change um it's on on the submission form it's already changed which is an important part um if you have any questions if you're watching this on YouTube in the comments and otherwise in the chat we will be doing the the panel now um so thanks everyone for speaking
