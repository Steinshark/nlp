who was the last movie star used to be back then movie stars true movie star you wouldn't do a talk show on TV you would avoid TV like the pl Jack Nicholson you would never see him on a talk show he'd do one interview that's part of that protection of exclusivity there was a mystery to him yeah yeah so that when you went to the theater Lally what makes a movie star is you you don't know too much really about their life so you your own life on them yeah yeah definitely that's what makes a movie [Music] star hello everybody I have the privilege today of speaking with actor Dennis Quaid he flew into scotdale to do the show in person um I saw a screening of his new film coming out in August end of August Reagan last year and uh uh thought it was a classic American production very much enjoyed it speaks of a very significant time in the history of the world really the defeat of the Communist Empire which is something remarkable and and and extremely relevant to today again when the same sorts of ideas are making their reemergence and so what did we talk about what are we going to talk about about well Dennis's career the challenge of playing Reagan uh the the purpose of drama the what would you say it's calling to us to see the world through the eyes of other people so that we can expand the way that we look at things and we can expand what we can understand we talk about Hollywood um we talk about the future of the music industry we talk about political attitudes and how they affect the entertainment world join us for all that so I think it was about a year ago that I was in LA and Mark Joseph showed me an early cut of Reagan yeah changed from uh from then well I like I liked it I I'll tell you why I liked it um I like the fact that the film concentrated on Reagan's activity as an anti-communist yeah you bet I thought that was wise all of his life yeah right right all of his life and and so I thought that was extremely interesting and I thought it was a wise choice to concentrate on that specifically because that that's the right what would you say that's the central story with him as far as pertains to the world that is what he you know almost single-handedly really because if we' had another president in there it would have been business as usual he defeated communism yeah the Cold War he defeated it in its last iteration it's making a lovely comeback at the moment well we didn't uh he didn't help them no he certainly didn't no no I I agree you know yeah and and I thought the film did a very good job of concentrating on what truly was Central about his presidency and I think that is what was Central and it was daring and as you said he had committed his whole life to it and so that was interesting I also I also thought the movie was interesting um from a narrative perspective because it kind of hearkened it was a classic Hollywood movie like it hearkened back to me for me to the kinds of movies that were made in the 1950s and the 1960s like it's unabashedly pro-american but not in a way that hits you over the head but it's also it doesn't have that kind of cynical bitterness that's characteristic of much of the Productions of popular culture really since the 1970 and so that was nice to see and and it it was it was pleasant to be carried away by a movie that was it wasn't like an Oliver uh a movie that Oliver would do like about Nixon right yeah right right right right so so how did you get involved in that project and why were you interested in it I took a meeting I think this is like 2017 that I heard these people they wanted to play Reagan and I was just like sure right because I didn't think I look like Reagan or the only thing we had in common was that we were actors and uh uh so I went and had a meeting with Mark and so it was a process you know because I uh he was my favorite President I will say that yeah and um I'd Liv through those times and knew what they were he was the first president uh I did vote for Jimmy Carter the in 76 regretted it and but in 1980 I voted for Ronald Reagan my dad was a huge Reagan fan and I voted for him and went home and my roommate at that time uh from Texas he said who'd you vote for and I said Ronald Reagan he said you are kicked out of the hippies yeah definitely that was like yeah for sure man you're not the hippie Club anymore so you're the how old were you when you how old were you when you when you voted for Reagan I was uh 26 26 okay so you were old enough to have some sense but you could have easily still been a hippie so I wouldn't have voted for Reagan when when I was back then I was still been too entranced by the blandishments of the left so why was it that at that time was a yeah yeah well like I said I voted for Jimmy Carter about that and then uh after which reminds me very much those times remind me very much of what's going on today there was this malaise that uh Carter had his M speech uh you know he uh the country was had lost confidence in itself you about who we are we was kind of accepted that we were a nation in Decline uh you know it was after Watergate it was after uh Vietnam the oil crisis the oil crisis uh and yeah the the hostages Jimmy Carter was like we tried to be and play nice with the Soviets during that time as you know as far as peace Jimmy Carter did a great job with uh in the Middle East with Egypt and Israel but he uh uh when it came to the Soviets it was like we gave away the B1 bomber for nothing in return and we kept for in return just to show our Goodwill I guess and the way the real politic works in the world they just were they were doing the biggest military buildup and were making they were going into Africa they were go all over the world they were making great strides uh into Central America and the like and uh Reagan who had always been you know this kind of cold warrior and great community Communicator came along and and told people to like pick yourself up you know there's a brighter day ahead and uh it was the perfect time for him right he also had a very Stark message which was that and very forthright which was unapologetically that the Soviets were an evil empire yeah which they certainly were and so he put his finger on that perfectly and so yeah that was all by Design he didn't talk to the Soviets for the first six years of his presidency because they kept dying on him right right that's right they were they were they were El they were putting forward like one 90y old after another right there was a sequence of them that lasted about six months in office right but it been but up until his presidency it had been appeasement uh with the Soviets I think uh Kennedy did a really great job of it Nixon was actually no matter what you think of him uh personally uh he was is probably had the the most knowledgeable uh world affairs president we've ever had and but Carter uh he tried to be nice guy he was he was an agreeable person the same way he personally got together Sadat and and bean yeah which he did a great job of but no you the thing is being empathic and warm and compassionate that works real well with people who are honest decent and yeah right and at the local that's exact right that's right that's a within family ethic right with the real thugs it's not the right approach they think you're a sheep these players on the world scene they're all they're badasses and that's one of the attractions that I had for Reagan at least you know he's a badass but he's my badass yeah you know yeah yeah and a principled a principled person a principled person right which was remarkable thing also to pull off I would say in Hollywood because I'm sure that he was subject to the same temptations that people are generally subject to in Hollywood yes and uh I'm sure gave into quite a few of those Temptations you know he's it was a human being but you know that's he always picked himself up he was um you know his his movie career he was a I think he was disappointed yeah in his in his film career he was he was uh he was a be movie actor and you know there the films were never quite up to what they should be you know it it's kind of like he could have been John Wayne but John there was already John way yeah right the Nish was already that was there and uh you know that he was married to Jane Wyman whose career went like this and his just kind of stayed yeah stayed there and he uh became vice president and then president of the screen actor's guild yeah uh during that time you know because his career was was fading really and it he it's there that the his real fight against communism started you know even though it was kind of rumored you know you got to be crazy but they really after the Soviet Union fell come to find you go to the archives come to find out they really were in the in our unions especially in Hollywood and uh yeah well it's it's he had Reagan actually had physical scars on his back from fights he got he got seriously beat up in in a a brawl at uh the union hall in fact from that and he had scars on his back and so he he didn't like he didn't like communism yeah yeah yeah well it's easy for us well I think still we're blind to the threat I mean I see in all of this University Uprising that's occurring now and all of these Bad actors who are protesting constantly in inner cities and setting up encampments and building these like independent cities there's a there's a stream of thought underneath that that's well it's it's it's very much akin to the Marxist stream although it's you get in you get into the society into the unions or whatever it is you start creating Mayhem yeah and Chaos you put one at this corner this corner that corner and then you just start creating this Mayhem and from that you start confusing people they feel like they can't do anything about it and it starts to grow on its own yeah and Reagan didn't want to expel uh Communists or even the Communist party you know he's principled in that way because he felt like democracy can handle it in fact that's what he testified at you know at the at Congress during during that time during the time of the Red Scare and all that I guess that's what we're trying to figure out right now too whether democracy can handle it democracy can handle it it really it what it takes is for is for people to be informed be aware and and to uh you know it's slow it's slow to move but uh people got to get involved yeah yeah and I do feel that pendulum happening in this country now that people are waking up you feel say I've had enough because it affects them in their house on their their house in their neighborhoods you know uh just the the the the the structure of and the substructure of society you know kind of breaking down you know little by little and uh where you don't feel safe anymore you don't this is uh this is not the way I remember it so how did you figure that out in your early in your mid 20s I mean I would suspect that the mill you you were in was pretty radical radically Progressive radically liberal like why how how was it that you came to be oriented in that more conservative direction or particularly in the anti-communist direction I'm I'm an independent I've never been a a republican I've never been a Republican party or the Democratic party and I've I've voted both ways uh my life according to what I thought the country needed at that time you know Republicans and Democrats is as you know they need each other yes yeah the the Republicans need the Democrats because of this social thing that's out there to to to kind of lead the way progressively you know we move along as a society and and the Democrats need the Republicans to kind of keep little governor on that make sure that we grow the right way and that you know that we don't leave behind principles and and things that are at the Bedrock of who we are so it's it's been both ways so let's go let's go back to to the to to Reagan per se so you had an you had a meeting you said in 2017 and you weren't sure that that was a part that was right for you I thought I thought when I watched the movie that you embodied Reagan remarkably well I well thank you I appreciate that but at the time yet tell you the truth what really is like this fear went up my spine oh okay because here he's like one of the most recognizable figures in the world right it's a big part to screw up yeah and uh you know that so I was I was really hesitant about it and you know I also wanted to make sure it was done right and and you know what it was and uh I so uh I they arranged for me to go up to the library which I went to and from there we went to uh I met his son Michael as well and we I went to the ranch and it was when I went up to the ranch you know the what was the Western White House back then above Santa Barbara and went up five miles to the top of the mountain five miles of the worst Road in California and can't believe the Queen of England actually tried to go up she was a tough cookie that that woman and uh you get to the top and opens up and I realized that Reagan was not a rich man because this place is is like it's nothing special and how special it is I mean the house itself was maybe 1,200 square ft you know uh it they had a king-size bed everything was left exactly as they left it and it's not a it's not a place that you can tour it's you know it's a private home and they had a king-size bed but it was two single beds that were zip tied together uh you know all of the the refrigerator to stove was uh ge cuz he worked for GE you know I'm sure he got a deal on that uh you could tell that he had done all the work there himself just like the legend had said and but there was a humbleness to it at the same time but he was not a rich man he made a lot of people rich and uh but uh he was really who he said he was m and that was the thing that really kind of convinced me at the time I started thinking well you know we're both actors we both have a sunny disposition kind of optimistic about the world and um there's something about him though that yeah that that's funny with with you that that Sunny disposition because you're you're not a kind of wide-eyed deer in the headlight sort of guy you know it's it's very interesting to see that Sunny disposition combined with something more like what would you say traditional masculinity and that's likely what Reagan managed too right cuz he was a he had enough backbone obviously to stand up to the Communists in the unions and verify yeah yeah right exactly and he meant that yeah and so yeah but yeah those things and then there was also uh in in getting into him because as an actor what really fascinates me about acting even more and more so is is what makes people tick and who are they behind what you think you know uh it that's what you know the motivations go back way back there was something in Reagan that was unknowable I come to find out and even those that were close to him uh would say that that I don't don't even know if Reagan was aware of it but there was something the great communicator there was a very private place in there that you could not breach I'm sure that n uh knew what that was but he was a very very private person underneath at all yeah well I wonder you know because of the remarkable role he played there's something singular about that right that that what would you say integrity and vision that enabled him to see the true nature of the Communist threat early to fight that locally and to learn learn how to do it and then to take that battle onto the international stage right to make that the the focal point of his presiden yeah even when it was really not the issue even like most people were over here about that he was and that's what makes a great president is when they can they can point out because they have all the info and they can say it's here that we need to go yeah and convince convince people people that you have what it is to go in the right direction remind them of the principles and um not just the the uh the issue of the day right well that's something to get to get folks right exactly well that's something like a prophetic Spirit right that ability to see the current situation clearly and to see into the future and to put your finger exactly in the right spot and it is it isn't the case generally speaking that American presidencies are founded on say a foreign policy Vision right that's foreign policy is important obviously but it's usually not Central and it's much easier for a president to default to some fast payoff local issue and to do that continually rather than to fight the battle he fought which he really fought for decades right literally for decades first to say no to the Soviets but his take was so brilliant and it was just disguised and because his idea and it wasn't originally his idea it was you know was it was uh from a lot of reading research and uh just time spent um he thought the answer was to bankrupt the Soviets right their economy is uh minuscule even today through to what ours is they had done so much military spending and they were really you know things were so bad over there for the for the Soviet people you lines just to get food and this and that at that three hours came he comes up with Star Wars which didn't really exist he got the idea from the movie you know about lasers you know that are going to shoot down missiles in space you know it didn't exist and Russians knew it didn't exist at least 90% mhm they knew it didn't exist but it was that 10% that Reagan made him think about it he didn't he didn't back off of it at all yeah and so but it that and that's what that's a weird blend of fiction and that really tore them up you know and uh so they were on this military spending and and finally they just you know it just toppled that's really what brought the Soviet Union down yeah well that's that's a remarkable clima to a life spent that you know that originated in local fighting with the Communists in the unions in Hollywood yeah yeah so how did you prepare to like how much work did you do biographical work and so forth I don't know exactly how you would prepare a lot of it I I yeah a lot of it I'd live through the I'd live through the times that had a lot to do and I I was a history buff to begin with so like you know I I remember the stuff but I uh I watched YouTube with uh really great because you have all of those you have everything you can go back and and uh and see uh and you know what do you get to I work outside in a lot so I work on the uh physical how's a person walk talk and and then from that it goes inside and I realize why that is for instance like Reagan had like a cook smile yeah right it's like yeah oh kind of H like that and there was uh and after you do that a while you realize well why is that and it's because that's why you looked like him in the movie that's so cool there's got to be there's some muscles that are deadened in his face yeah from what uh I don't know but that's you know that leads you to the the inside of of of a person of where they kind problem and the way he walked the way he uh uh the way a person Grooms themselves the way they you know the the image they put out and then there's the but really when you get down to that's the outside and you have all the news stories and stuff but I talked to a lot of people who knew him personally yeah and um yeah and I think that's really where it Formed I didn't want to do an impersonation that's the thing that scared me with anything of you know doing an impersonation what's the difference can your savings weather another economic storm think about what you've put away for the future inflation can render cash worthless and even real estate can crash as it did in 2008 during times of economic

impersonation is an act you know it's like something you'd see on Saturday night the getting down to who the person is the real person is quite another thing a a personal side it really humanizes them yeah makes them singular and I I like to uh want to get a part of a real person of which I've played many I'd like to tell uh tell it their story from their point of view yeah yeah you know not well not from the outside but what we thought of them and not for me to really I try not to comment too much I try to tell it from their point of view what is it like the question is what if I me were this person yeah in this situation right well that's also what you're transmitting to the audience right that opportunity so what part of the reason that we go to see movies is because by watching the people on screen and by noting their characterization we can adopt their aim and as soon as we adopt our like our emotions Orient themselves around aim and so if you can embody a character yeah exactly if you can or if you can characterize a person's aims then you can invite the audience to adopt their perspective right and that means they can live being Reagan for example in the course of the mov why we go to the movies absolutely and so way have okay so so how long did you play Reagan and what was the effect of that on you like I'm I'm curious when you embodi these characters so deeply it has to it because you're really occupying a different perspective it has to change you I would presume um you know I find myself like never really asking that question um I it's something to me it's about learning about it's about learning about myself yeah I don't know how exactly how to sometimes articulate that um but and I leave I leave I have learned to just leave the character at the end of the day at the end of the take in fact just like go do something else right right because I've already it's kind of like osmosis I've already done all all the work and now just let the let the subconscious work right right so you can leave it see this one of the things that you learn as a therapist is to because you're listening to people and you're trying to adopt their perspective but if you take that home with you then you you can't it over time they have happened to me you know I learned that when I played Jerry Lee Lewis cuz oh yeah well to tell me about that because I I didn't believe that uh yeah at the set to tell you the truth and that was Great Balls of Fire yeah it was Great Balls of Fire and so you know I wound at at the end about six months after uh it came out or maybe a year yeah I was in rehab oh cocaine School I see I see and and what and and there was a manner in which that was directly attributable to playing that character yeah you know make you manic like what no well I was kind of already kind of you know uh you uh I was already kind of along the path and and that just uh jeredy Lewis is like everything on steroids right man that's how you played him too I mean that's a very high energy character man yeah he was the guy one of probably yeah what a great pianist and uh and yeah performer yeah he was one that I got to like hang around uh he was on the set just about every day oh yeah in fact when we shot at Memphis and he was uh over my shoulder going you get it wrong son like uh after it takes especially the music stuff but you know he was also very generous he would uh he was one of my piano teachers I I didn't play Pi before that you know just like Chopsticks and he uh was one of my teachers and uh you know getting that left hand really was the key to Jerry Lee Lewis because it's a very athletic move of being able to keep that up and I had a year to prepare for it and and and I was on cocaine so I spent 12 hours a day at the at the piano you know during that time so and uh um but it's uh I still play you know I continued afterwards and uh well that's a good habit you picked up yeah that was the that was the good that came from it because it was you know that was a great gift from him and he was he could be really so generous of spirit and then he could be like a 14year old schoolyard bully at the same time you know and Trump's like that what think Trump's like that um cuz you know I've talk lot of people to know him and they talk about his generosity and his kindness in person but he's got that 13-year-old schoolyard bully thing which also well that's the that's the that's the the the bully that's you know out there uh about what he believes and I think he's a very principal to down at the bottom of it yeah and uh but uh I I think he can be bullish yeah well it isn't obvious it was in the construction business man you got business you got to be hard for all that stuff because you know it's like it's all Mafia you got you got to watch it yeah that's for sure you take it so he built a building for a friend of mine in Chicago like a multi hundred million dollar building he brought it in under budget and before scheduled and that was in Chicago and that's you know that's but he's a he's very he is he is very sweet at the same time he he could be could be that I you look at this kids you know it's um he did a great job raising his kids you look at it they are they themselves very principled and and um a great relationship with them like that right right yeah I mean in a way I mean you can't say the same thing about Reagan there was you know we Tred not to be like like a a love letter for this you know cuz it was human at the same time and he you know his he didn't have the greatest relationship with his kids you know was he too preoccupied well his son you know his youngest son Ron Ron uh takes every T opportunity he can to uh talk against them and to uh really try to tear apart the the legacy of his father and his mother mhm and uh Michael Michael and he that's who he had uh they have a they have a good decent relationship he and he and Michael do and you know Patty it's uh I can't really uh I can't speak for any of them really and I'm sure they all have their personal reasons for that but you know that he wasn't around much because working in the studio he was working for GE was always on uh he comes from that generation that you know you grew up and you're pretty independent and on your own as as a kid you know like the way I grew up my parents uh it wasn't like the '90s that were your you know helicopter parents or are are really you know the people were living at home till they were 25 and stuff like that you were you know a lot of cases you know you grew up on a farm you were like 14 15 like you need to go you know find your own life well you and so it's but anyway that was that was the relationship I think it was there was a distance there I think with his with his kids yeah well it it's hard for men to strike a balance between doing what they need to do in the world and being around enough for their family now I mean I I I struggle with that all the time because I'm always traveling and stuff and I try to be there as much for my kids but you know parental guilt follows you no matter what and it's just always there no matter how uh good a parent or present parent you might you might be so what do you make of his flaws like how would you characterize them you you you spent a long time inhabiting his skin like we talked about Reagan as someone who had a long-term Vision who was very committed to it who was very good at communicating that in a way that was compelling and who well who was one of the main players in the devastation of the Soviet Union right I would say him Alexander Solan niton and the pope were the oh maybe you could throw leesi in there too as a as an additional contributor they're not the only people obviously major players we it was like that was in concert all with the Pope and with with Le valenza that was it was all in concert with the United States they wouldn't have been doing what they do if you hadn't had the support from the United States that that they had you know and uh um but uh the uh the flaws with everybody's everybody's flawed you know I think like early in his like his movie career I don't think he I don't think he believed in himself uh so much when when he came to that's why he accept more second rate scripts yeah I think he was just out to like um work for a living you know and it takes you got to um you got to be willing to wait for things at the same time I mean that must be my like I've done stuff for money and he wish I had done that luckily I've been able to get to get through it yeah and um you I also remember uh like in Iceland when uh you know the final meeting with uh or the the meeting with gorbachov about we were going to like dism nuclear weapons and Gorbachev's had said you know we'll dismantle all nuclear weapons just give up Star Wars yeah and Reagan said no yeah right and Star Wars didn't even really exist and uh you know and he' offered his he had offered to gorbachov will share the technology with you so that we both have it and said to know that and but Reagan said no and I thought at that at that time his presidency I thought that um there's that old codger coming up you know that won't that won't Bend yeah and that you know I didn't think it was finessed uh the right way I mean I wasn't there but you know went down and then also it's I think he delegated a lot which was kind of a strength and that he was an adman you know as president he showed us what kind of the president he was the best Kennedy was also great at it but as far as being representing a president as an adman you know as an image he was really good out but he delegated a lot and I think he wasn't maybe like an iron iron uh Contra he wasn't able to really keep his um finger I and you know to really be aware of what was going on was delegated and I don't think he had Direct knowledge of it you know once he said okay I like these guys yeah then AIDS was another thing that I think he really uh you can fault him with he made the wrong decision on AIDS he uh really portrayed it from the start as um that a punishment from God on for the sin of being gay because it was really recognized as a gay disease or uh if you're a drug addict and and you know I I he was in that case I think he was out of touch and um missed the boat you know on that but you know it's he's still a man of principles but you know some times uh people have their faults nothing there is no perfect Well it's worse than that in some ways there's no Perfect Crime well also sometimes I learned this from reading nche it was the first time I'd really thought about it that it isn't exactly obvious that someone's faults are clearly distinguishable from their virtues I mean you look at Trump for example right he's got that bully aspect and he's really good at it like he's like the world's best 13-year-old bully he can nail you with a nickname and he'll use what you said and then you turn around make a nickname of it he'll make fun of of handicap people he you know it's like there's sobody there been so many times where I just want to say please be why why do you have to go there part of that it's I I can't help but think that part of that is also what makes them intimidating to people like the the dictator of North Korea exactly you know and it's so like how do you CU if he was agreeable like Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter was a very nice man by all by all appearances and by all reputation but he's not the sort of person that like a real Psychopathic leader is going to take seriously whereas Trump like and maybe this is also why he could deal with the mafia types in the construction industry in Chicago it's like you have to have a touch of it's like Harry Potter you have to have a touch of the devil inside you in order to understand what the devil's like even our allies take care of their self-interest first yeah you know and if that doesn't happen to coinci side with us they're still going to look after themselves first and then you have uh Saddam Hussein you you know you the Ayatollah you have you know uh some of uh you have Putin you have uh the Chinese they are these people they're smart these are really smart people and they know real politic and they are ruthless when it comes to their agendas and they go these have been going on a lot longer than one president been these guys are in there for life and they've and you take uh a little Kim over there in North Korea this is like the third generation since uh you know of the grandfather the father and the son and the son and uh they you know they're they're moving on these things this not just talk from them yeah you have to take them yeah well and you need it looks to me like need someone with a certain degree of far as it's like let's all be so understanding and everything they love that yeah yeah yeah they love that stuff absolutely absolutely absolutely well this is the problem with a kind of a naive agreeableness is that trying to get along with people works really well unless you're dealing with the shark in which case it doesn't work at all all you're doing is laying yourself open to be ripped to shreds yeah and this the way it's always been and you're going to make things worse yeah by if you're trying to avoid war you're going to create one yeah because there's just going to be this red line that that they you know they come closer and closer to if you keep them over there I say don't cross that yeah yeah but you keep them if you know if you don't back up what you say then they'll take advantage of it yeah well I think it's a remarkably well I think Trump accomplished two things that were truly remarkable and I think very much under appreciated Isis yes okay we could throw Isis in there I was thinking I was thinking no Wars and I was thinking the Abraham Accords because abrah ACC he should have got a all all this stuff that's happening right now would not be happening if the Abraham Accords had been signed yeah because I mean that's in a way that goes Way Beyond what Carter did although what Carter did was incredible but it was like a real true continuation of that of of Saudi Arabia because they were devoted to wiping Israel off the map up until this point yeah yeah yeah so so so let me ask you this a little bit what was the second thing um oh no Wars in Abraham Accords is what I was thinking was his fundamental achievements like those are both major achievements of Peace yeah which is not necess it's certainly not what anybody would have predicted at the onset of Trump's presiden everybody thought that uh Reagan was going to be a warer he was called that throughout his presidency no matter what you know and it especially when he was like saying no to these Soviets you know it's like oh the don't don't they going to have a war but that's really what kept us out of War yeah yeah definitely definitely definitely yeah well the 80s were uh they were an intense time I mean people people were more terrified of nuclear war in the 80s than we're terrified now of climate change good reason I mean there was there was at least two incidents where it was like this close I know I know I mean they were seconds away from pushing the button it turned out to be a flock of geese or you take uh the Korean uh airliner yeah you know that shot down those are scary absolutely absolutely they absolutely so what's it been like what's been the consequences of your political engagement maybe your political stance in relationship to your career in Hollywood uh I am who I am and yet uh like I said I you know I I'm I'm an independent I really truly am an independent you know I voted for Obama once I voted for Clinton once you know I voted for Ross pero once I voted right you know uh um uh so it's it's I why would we were doing Reagan uh you know that was we were doing it in 2020 and that was you know during Co and stuff and they tried to cancel me twice tell me about that uh once was over a I was doing a podcast around that time you know and uh uh I forgot what what Outlet I was having an interview with it's right when covid started happening and Trump was you know in those meetings you know uh on television every day you know giving updates about what was happening remember those times and uh you asked me like what do you how do you think Trump is handling uh you know the crisis I said well you know at least he's there every day he's you know comes out and it he's there every day may not you know be making uh saying the right things or this or that but you know it's he's there every day and uh and that's reassuring you know to see your leaders out there that they're doing something about it and and and over that uh you know the you know they were trying to like they blew that up into that was one time and then while we were doing the film there was this false story that came out this was was uh that I had taken like $400,000 from uh the CDC through Trump to do a commercial uh for the vaccine or something like that which was totally false false narrative and how I you know my son was calling me up about like hey man you're going to get canceled over this as like people you know was like and uh so you know but I didn't get cancelled but well it was untrue to begin with so um do you have any idea why you did why you didn't get cancelled like did you do something right or do you like people get cancelled so why didn't it happen to you when because storms kind of I don't know I I I don't know it's a it's a I went on Instagram immediately and you know exposed it yeah and you know but right so there was smoke but no fire so that's helpful yeah I don't know maybe it's I like I I'm really on neither neither side is left and right I come from a time when you had conservative Democrats and Liberal Republicans and their agendas were not so far apart

and um I've had more success talking to Republicans frankly it's been easier for me to talk to them and I don't think it's because I'm particularly it's certainly not initially conservative in my orientation although I think I've become more conservative in some ways the the Democrats their fundamental sin as far as I can tell is that they can't draw a boundary at all between the mainstream Democrats which are the majority and the minority of radicals are controlling absolutely well and these are exactly the same people as far as I'm concerned that Reagan was facing off against in the 1950s in Hollywood it's exactly the same thing and like I've asked 50 Democrats that I've talked to when does the left go too far and I've never got a straight answer from any of them and that's that's the God's honest truth right it's like well obviously the left can go too far right I mean remember the Soviet Union remember ma China it's like they went too far when I asked RFK that he said I don't want to have divisive campaign really brilliant man but you asked him what well I asked him when the left goes too far and he said I don't want to run that kind of divisive campaign it's like well you know the radicals are pulling your party to the left to in a major way and maybe it's time to draw some boundaries like for me I'm not a fan at all of the equity move the idea of equality of outcome that's like that's a catastrophic idea it eliminates individual difference and why would you do that especially if you're interested in diversity it's like can't be quality of outcome if you want people to be different like those things don't go together and you're going to compare people on absolutely every Dimension and you're going to insist on equality you're going to wind up handcuffing and uh you know basically coddling people where they they can't get ahead because you know life's tough for everybody yeah around here and I definitely totally believe in a safety net for socially you know that wasn't originally part of the Constitution what it was what the government is supposed to provide but you know I definitely uh do believe in that uh but uh and but you there's some government sponsored programs they you go back like Social Security these things that were meant to help people you go back to the 19th century and there was like nothing yeah you know you had like this is where all this stuff started where you had the Vanderbilts and the Morgans and the Rockefellers and everything and there was the Carnegie there was this no uh checks and balances on wealth they were Carnegie was you know rivaled the the the government himself I mean you put them all together they they were uh they had more cash than the government did and there was no checks and balances on that a lot of people was they wind up then with you know up here and then down here and so I think you know some of the things that uh came in to being you know social networks and the Democrats can't take credit for all of them no no you know Teddy Roosevelt was very you know Progressive uh it was Republican and um Lincoln of course and uh you know things and but uh at the same time you go you can go too far [Music] about and what is the point in the end it's seems to me when it goes too far it's when it's not about what they're talking about it's about power yeah yeah it's it's totally just about power don't care if you don't care what you're tearing down if you look at the political Spectrum like a distribution between left and right as you get farther out on the fringes you get out of the political I think entirely is that you get into the domain of people who are using the political for nothing but power and they are very they're exactly the Psychopaths that we were talking the Marxist agend agenda you know create chaos and move into that people used to yeah and it's all about compassion but actually what it's about is power right yeah compassion disgu the Democrat I the Republicans have done it uh as well get know I wasn't really very proud of the Republican Party back back in the 90s in in a sense they played kind of the the personal they like the the way they were with Clinton and that it was like they weren't working together like they could have been working together and it it seemed like to me like a power move on the Republican well back back in the 990s you know you go into the 80s and into the 90s so I just did a last year I did a seminar on Exodus on the story of Moses Moes and Moses is the archetypal leader and his fundamental Temptation and flaw is power right so it's always the case that in the political realm the Temptation is to default power and to corrupt Enterprise like with Clinton you know this he did something which is not a crime but because he lied about it this then they go into like the Republicans PS and they they impeached him uh you know impeached him and that was you know a play for power uh you know uh yeah they failed ultimately and that you know times were so good and Clinton Clinton also was very good about uh you know two years into his presidency he was was like a duck he wasn't he wasn't going to make it for the second election cuz times are bad and yeah that turned he he was so pragmatic and so smart that he basically absconded the Republican agenda popped it down and went State of the Union speech said the era of of of welfare in this country is over you know and well that's how he won the second election and he was he was very pragmatic person let me return to Hollywood if if you don't mind um seemed to me that Hollywood took a walloping blow with covid and then the strike and like one of the things I've noticed about myself is I used to go to movies all the time I to theaters I love going to movies and I've gone to very few movies since covid it's kind of like I don't know if I got out of the Habit it's something like that partly I used to know where to get reliable reviews for upcoming movies like I was in the Stream I knew what was coming out of Hollywood I made plans to go see the movies right that all disappeared and now I don't know how to get back to that but I think and you're wondering is it because of my age must be yeah yeah well that could be too although see I don't know or is it just that way well I well I I also don't know that and and of course the media landscape is fragmented too and so it's hard to figure out what sources you can rely on the way they advertise movies is nowhere near what it used to be used to be just like an ad in the newspaper yeah and and that was enough yeah and then it became like TV as and audiences could smell a movie yeah right it was like so surprising it was just like I remember for me personally uh breaking away when that came out it was was no advertising or anything like that and were driving to the theater you know to go to go for the you like the opening of it you on that Friday yeah and there's a line around the block like well people are in the movie they well that's that's the thing is that these things are very fragile you know is that we never know makes a whole Enterprise work and if people are movie fans they're in the movie culture they track it and if you break that it's like that's gone yeah well yeah okay so you that's gone uh you don't see Roger eert on television anymore these there was a whole culture that went with it that everybody watched one the movies coming up and like you know uh laying them out there what they're about and and all that and yeah you know and you knew months in advance really you know great debates on on what they were about and uh so so how do you what how do you view the current reality and the potential future of the film industry are there still Stars it's that's the thing who was the last movie star well from what I've been able to understand the only star truly standing de cael or a Cruz that's going too far back Leonardo Leo I mean last movie they're still out there they do occur yeah they're out there but they also my sense too is that and I don't really know what to make of this that they're are they The Last of a Dying Breed well you know the new is like it's gone from it's gone to social media yeah that's where the new movie stars are I mean Justin Bieber the first star to created on YouTube yeah you know not the nowhere near the the traditional way yeah of doing it and that actors now are the same way they have their their Instagram uh page they you know self advertising and uh but used to be back then movie stars like in the you know growing up and really until the 80s 90s true movie star you wouldn't do a talk show on TV you would avoid TV like the play Jack Nicholson you would never see him on a talk show he'd do one interview in a prestigious magazine whether it be time Playboy right whatever it was right that was that's part of that protection of exv and you would you know some guy would spend a couple of days with him or something but you really wouldn't there was a mystery to him yeah yeah so that when you went to the theater Lally what makes a movie star as you go to the theater they are a mystery you don't know too much really about their life so you imprint your own life on them yeah yeah definitely that's that's what happens yeah you know you see them for something inside you yeah and that's what makes a movie star well you actually don't want to know much about the person life of an actor and now it's like well it got to be that you just do everything yeah about everybody yeah and that brings them down to earth and that's not good if you're a star well it it doesn't create mystery yeah right put it that way I wonder too how much of it is the fact that like when you and I grew up being on television was like that was a remarkable and unlikely occurrence to be personally on television even to know someone who was on television the bandwidth was so narrow and then the movies were above that it was easier to be on TV than on the movies but now everyone is on TV all the time yeah right and so that that that's another borderline between the public and the actor that's disappeared it's like everybody is videoed from the time they're young there's no going back and this way the world has and and you know good things come out of it good things what do you see that's good coming out of it well for one thing there's this there's really a broad communication in the Z guys people have taken over their own stories yeah and like you could be like me and choose not to participate very much you know I I I mean I have Instagram page I have a Facebook page and I you know I kind but I uh you know I didn't grow up with it so it seems like a real chore to me yeah and uh right it's not your culture yeah and I like face to-face communication and and I like this this you know this is great because it's it's it's uh it's a real I I feel like I'm uh this that is one good thing about today as opposed to then is that you could do an interview like with a magazine and you know somebody was about to do a job on you Absolut because they kind of feel like they build you up you know you have this fall and then you have the comeback the thing but like with this it's unfettered yeah and I get to represent myself yeah yeah yeah well you YouTube's great for that and podcasts are great for that and they really reward unfitted communication like the people I've talked to anybody I've talked to on my YouTube channel who politics or is false they get slaughtered yeah like if they say it comes out very quickly find out who people are yeah you can't hide so much yeah well that's Joel Rogan told me he said you know you can tell if there's anything to anyone after about 20 minutes yeah because you can well people who are Hollow they're exhausted especially in a podcast like Rogan's which is three hours long it's like there better be some depth to you to get through that conversation in an interest in manner for three bloody hours they're kind of like you know let's see what happens like 30 years from now but you know uh some of this stuff is going to come back to haunt people you know I mean some of the things that I did and thought or whatever you know back in uh my teens 20s man I'm so glad it's not on you that's

really a nonstop parade of stupid decisions they should be able to make those stupid decisions in private right that's for sure man the last thing I would have wanted was video records of that right for it to be distributed around the school I can't imagine like it was it was a a a a difficult enough Enterprise is trying to negotiate the weird social world of adolescence without having to be absolutely terrified that some goddamn stupid thing you did was going to be permanently instantiated in the minds of everyone in your town God I I just can't imagine what that would be like terrible terrible yeah and you can't just move away from it because it's well that's right that's rights you well that's right well one of the wonderful things about human memory is that we forget yeah right the remembering that's not a miracle like things happened and so now you know it it's like well can you forget can you put it behind you well not if it's permanently recorded yeah yeah no that's just that's not good tell me what you're working on now and what you have in the future maybe what you're excited about on the film front um well I've uh I've started uh a production company with my wife and a business partner and uh make fil films that that I really believe in and that we all believe in you know as a company and uh you know kind of based on uh certain movies in in my career like you know like to me like breaking away the right stuff the rookie you The Parent Trap the you know it's a brand basically and that I want to to do and uh part of that I get with have a thing now Diamond Back which is a film I hopefully we're going to be shooting this year uh that very much like a a movie of the from the 70s that I and uh that I really believe in what's the plot of diamond it's it's it's uh you see like Thunderbolt and light foot it's it or a really uh a great s pack and Pa movie it's like that I see and it's modern at the same time it takes place in the 60s true story this kid who was in the Marines you know stationed in quanico gets out of the Marines he's just his wife died while he was in the Marines it and they wouldn't let him go home you know she try to cancer and he just you know he's young and he's just like it's sort of like you know Oswald you know he got out he was a marine he got out and you know uh these guys to get out of the military and they just kind of like ramble around they're kind of uh they don't they don't have a path he wanted to Rob at a bank really smart kid uh wound up robbing a bank robbed and then robbed two banks in the same day same town well for a penny for a pound went to uh you know and when he was being sentence he got caught it was like in the desert it was one of these chases through the desert which is like a modern Western just so fantastic and uh he told the judge when he was sentence that just give me 20 years because it doesn't matter because I'm going to be getting out I'm going to break out and then he did then he got caught again then he broke out again and he eventually got and there was this one cop that was chasing him and uh who became like a father son thing and uh you he got involved with this with this case they wound up on like the third time um they shot each other in the desert and uh right so you go to 60s Adventure you got a western thing going on it's the anti-hero it's it's it's an anti-hero uh you know the rebel hero turned anti-hero role that which is very reminiscent of the movie movies of the of the 70s are you good at evaluating scripts yeah I've read enough of them I know by page page 30 will really tell you I mean I might be 15 I'll go where is this but P page 30 if it hadn't happened yet it's it ain't going to happen and that's how I choose movies I read a script and I am an audience member yeah with a first time experience can you imag the story yeah I can yeah and it's funny how like every movie I've ever done it's the script yeah in that description part uhhuh but um um you can certainly elevated from there but basically it's the story that's what many what really gets me is the story how many movies have you done I think we're getting up towards uh I I know it's at least 120 but it might be 150 I don't wow wow yeah and what what percentage of those do you think are good well well I wasn't exactly or live up to what I thought they would be uh yeah that you're that you're that you're particularly pleased about in ret oh I I yeah probably I'd say maybe 20% oh yeah oh yeah yeah maybe then there's you know there's that those ones that are just really close to me I have different reasons for uh loving some of the movies that that's different from an audience because was like like I watched myself in a film and I remember it has so much to do with what was going on on in my life at the time uhhuh uhhuh you know what I mean so in the scientific literature the best predictor of quality so let's say the impact of a scientist's work on other scientists that's a good measure of quality the best predictor is quantity right so there's a real tight relationship it's very difficult to do anything of note without doing a lot of things yeah right so you're going to that's true if you a lot of them are taking chances you know some of them some of them more financial uh um uh was reason motivated yeah uh but uh you know Tred to do things I've never had any kind of strategy in my career except to try to do as many different types of things as possible right I typ cast myself right as as a character in a genre and whatever that broadens what you're able to do too well the thing that's my interest it's like what makes people tick you know what's this something you know the best things there something that really scares you because fear is a really great motivator like Reagan for example it's a really great motivator when does the movie come out when does it comes out August 30th yeah yeah are you excited about it I'm really excited about it yeah I you know it's going to be distributed widely we went through a process in the editing of it as well yeah that um that got to a place that I'm really happy with it oh good tell you the truth yeah oh good oh good I wonder how much it's changed since the screener I saw last year you have this you have the script you have the the movie you shot then you had the movie you edit yeah yeah no kidding that's where it really happen that's for sure man yeah yeah something to be able to edit well that's where you really get the point of view yeah and you point at the story yeah yeah yeah all right sir is that it that's it for this side for everybody watching and listening I'm going to continue this conversation behind the daily wire plus platform for another half an hour so
