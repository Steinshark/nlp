the last week has been an absolute Whirlwind for the world of not only security but open source in general if you're not aware of what happened a back door had been put in the XZ project in particular a back door was put in lib lzma we've had a couple of days to figure out what's going on here and luckily some researchers from around the community figured out exactly what this back door does in this video we're going to break down how the back door behaves what it looks like over the wire and what the attacker meant to do with it also hi I am lowle learning I make videos about programming software security so if you like that or just want to hang out with me hit that sub button I really appreciate it full disclosure I did not write the code in this video I did not do R reverse engineering I a dad I'm very busy but luckily other people in the community had the time to take care of this and do it I'm going to link all of their work and the repost in the description below please go check out their stuff go follow them on Twitter go like And subscribe to their content uh but in this video we're going to break down how XZ bot Works XZ bot being a way to interact with the back door using some reverse engineering strategies that a researcher at Google use let's get into it right now now if you want to follow along with me it's actually really easy to do so the the author of the xbot repo actually gave a great write up on how to set up an environment that allows you to use op ssh in the way that would depend on the backd door I am in a sandboxed environment you're looking at an auntu 2204 virtual machine and I'm doing this in a way that I protecting myself against any additional features that may not have been found in the back door like maybe for example it calls home to some C2 server I don't want that to happen in my home network right so this has been completely isolated in a way that I'm not worried about that the way this back door works is absolutely insane and the way they implemented their C2 with this back door would have never been caught without severe auditing of the process and again thank God that the researcher at Microsoft found this thing so the way that it works is the back door has to be triggered with a spefic specific set of data in the key exchange of the SSH connection the back door can be triggered by connecting with an SSH certificate with a payload in the ca certificate Authority signing key and Valu this payload must be encrypted and signed with the attacker's EDD 448 key that's elliptic curve cryptography 448 is the key space key the way this works is basically when you do a certificate exchange with the server that has been infected by the back door what the back door will actually do is check has that certificate been signed by the attacker right and if you don't know what signing means when you sign something you have two keys you have a private key and a public key in a signing scheme the public key is the key used to decrypt and the private key is the key used to encrypt so e is private D is public now when you want to sign something what you're actually doing is using the private key to encrypt a hash of it and then when you want to verify the signature you decrypt the hash and you say okay cool after I've decrypted the thing the hash matches the hash of the data therefore only the person who is able to sign this could have created this data so what they're doing is they're hiding their command and control the command they want to run on the back door server in the certificate authorities signing key end value so this is absolutely wild because when you're doing a cryptographic key exchange over the wire it's just a blob of data just like how they hid the back door in an lzma stream they're also hiding the C2 over data that is normally not otherwise inspected people kind of just accept that like okay an SSH exchange is going to have some binary data we're not going to touch it so they have these three bytes here and basically the algorithm command 1 * 2 + 3 has to equal three and if it doesn't the back door keeps processing otherwise it'll take that check the signing value and then move forward then inside of the certificate Authority and value that has been signed if these three values equal three it'll have a cipher text the back door will then decrypt the cipher text with this known symmetric key we have two kind of key schemes going on here we have the signing scheme that says this payload came from the evil person and then the cipher text is just to hide it right so we have to decrypt it and find out okay cool now we know what the the payload Is So within the cipher text once it's been decrypted we have the signature of the cipher text the command to run and then some kind of padding to make it all the right size to be able to do the the encryption so basically inside the back door there is this evil key 0 a31 FD blah blah blah blah blah and this is the public key of the attacker now in theory the attacker has the associated private key if they were able to sign a payload and send it to an infected server it would decrypt it as we just described and run the payload now because we don't have the attacker's private key unless you do if you do turn yourself in but no one really does right so what we have to do to prove the back door works is we have to replace the public key with a known public key that we have the associated private key for so the author of this repo took the public key out of the project and replaced it with this public key and then in the script to test the back door has the known private key they made a little script called Python 3 patch. piy where you give it an infected lzma file it'll find the function that does the backdooring and it'll in place replace the bad key with the good key or I guess the the the attacker's key with your key and this is actually really good way of testing if you have a vulnerable version right basically if you find that you have this string in your lzma file you have the public key in your binary you are infected get rid of it so to get my server set up basically I have SD running as a system D service the reason that this matters is because SSH by default does not depend on lzma without running as a system Des service and the way we can check this is we can do ldd on user Espin sshd by doing this it'll expose ose all of the shared objects that the binary depends on right we can see right here that because it's compiled in a way that depends on system D messaging it is compiled with lib lzma and then this lib lzma if we do a LSL on the file we can see that this is a Sim link to the version that I compiled the test the backd door which is live lzma 560 now how do we make this meaningful right again we want to test the back door but we don't have the private key to do the evil bidding so here what I'm doing is I'm taking the patch file they wrote and I'm pointing it at the backd door lzma library that I compiled locally on my computer and what it does is it finds the function that has the back door in it and it produces a patch version of shared object that has a public key that we know the private key for and so we can just copy this to our systems libraries right and now when we go to run sshd it will depend on the malicious version that has our known public key back door is still having the same functionality it's just it has a public key that we actually know the value before and this is where it gets really crazy so we can use XZ bot and what it does is it uses that structure of take the command encrypt it put those three magic values and then sign that with the private key and it sends it to the SSH server we can do xbot Tac H to get the help menu right and so we're going to do the adder of my local server which is 12701 don't leak my IP address please uh and Port 22 right so this is it showing us the key exchange that's happening and again what's so scary about this this is if you were to observe this over the wire you would not think anything bad about the nature of this data this is just an RSA key exchange like why would there be anything evil here and so what they did is they took that data that people normally trust and they use that as a place to hide their payload so what we can do now is we can use this to run evil commands and the nature of the evil commands is even scarier so let's do tack H again to kind of show the string here we'll do command and I want to run ID which shows you what privilege level you are on the system and I'm going to Output it to temp for the video now we did that you know nothing crazy happened on the system it just kind of ran quietly but if I cat temp for the video you'll see that the output of ID was root this is where things get even crazier and I think everyone kind of knew this but you have to really put your wrap your head around the magnitude of this bug if the attacker had not got caught they would have had a back door in the process of lib zma that when compiled on servers would be depended on by sshd then when able to execute the back door via a C2 channel that is encrypted and mostly avisc and not really questioned they get arbitrary command execution not as some user on the system but as root and why is that because sshd runs as root it has to run as root to then deescalate your privious to the user that you log in as absolutely terrifying now while this bug is super scary and kind of highlights the nature of the vulnerabilities of Open Source software what I do like about what's happened is it's getting people to think it's a basically the entire Community has woken up and now realizes oh there's a problem and it's no longer this like quiet thing that people in you know conspiratorial Corners were were talking about so anyway get your thinking caps on think of cool Solutions of how we cane prevent this from happening in other repos and then if you were totally lost about what's going on go check out this video see you guys there take care
