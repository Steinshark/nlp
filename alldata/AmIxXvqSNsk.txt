hello everyone and welcome i have teamed up with shell for this video and this is a very special video because this is my last road trip i will be taking in my honda s2000 and not only that its with some really great people so shell has brought together myself eric the car guy Chris fix Charles from huddle mechanic and Matt Moran motoring together for a road trip here to go check out the Indy 500 so we all brought our cars here to Cincinnati and then we're going to be driving to the Indy 500 the five of us and this is all part of Shell launching their new formulation of shell v-power Nitro+ which started development in 2015 and is now launching here in 2019 now I don't know if you guys knew about this but Honda also puts a little something called VTEC in their engines and the sale it's actually quite spectacular from this little 2 liter engine [Music] all right how awesome is this we are about to get police escort to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway so we're actually going to be parking inside of the Indy 500 track and we're gonna be parking outside of the museum so this should be pretty sweet police escort on the way there I'm sure will upset some people on the way by skipping all of the traffic and just having this awesome fellow right here take us in this is sick stay close stay safe those are my instructions here we go so why would I be selling my ass mm well you know i-i've had it for almost three years now and I feel like it's simply run its course I think it's in the perfect spot we're at sad I don't think it needs additional modification or it's gonna start to take away from the drivability I haven't touched the stock suspension I think it has an excellent stock suspension same wheels stock wheels ooe wheel size are just powder coated what I've done it's supercharged so it's got about eighty more horsepower over stock very low boost it's running on these stock ECU and piggyback ECU stock injectors completely emissions compliance so just about any wheel horsepower over stuck and it's pretty special you know they don't really make cars like this revving to 9,000 rpm forged internals you know aluminum forged pistons steel forged connecting rods carbon fiber and aluminum composite cylinder liner no traction control no stability control you know you're the driver you got to correct it if you're messing up rear-wheel drive limited slip differential actually changed out the rear diff to a four point four four rather than the stock 4.1 so it keeps the RPM even higher on the highway at about seventy miles an hour it's at 4000 rpm which can get a little old titanium exhaust took out 35 pounds so very cool not you know much of a power gain from that titanium exhaust but more of a weight thing it's saying weighing about 2,800 pounds a little bit more with the addition of the supercharger even though I took out 35 pounds with that exhaust so kinda help compensate for it this is just bizarre breaking all the traffic laws and doing so on camera with a police escort but like I said I feel like I've run the course with this project I've done all kinds of different tests whether it's with tires brakes whether or not this thing has a hot air intake I have done different modifications as I've started to go through done you know DIYs how to change out different fluids in this car some of the more simple repairs on it so I've done quite a bit over 40 videos on this car so you know I feel like it's time for me to switch things up and it's not that you know I really don't get that attached to cars I love this thing I think this is truly one of the greatest machines ever built it is a phenomenal phenomenal car but I don't get I don't get attached like I don't miss my Integra even though I loved that card and and I don't think I'll miss this s2000 either even though I put a good amount of time and work into it and certainly money as well but you know I enjoy changing up getting new different things and just trying to continue to learn that's what the whole premise of this channel started on was learning and man it is just so cool to be here with these four guys she'll bring us together in fact shows a big part of the reason why we all know each other we've all met at previous shell events I met Charles Urschel event did like an engine building contest back in the day with eric the car guy still on the channel if you want to check out that video so show has really brought us together and it's very cool that they brought all of our cars together in the same place and here we are getting a police escort to the Indy 500 how sweet is this personally I feel like this is kind of rude we're just telling everyone to get out of our way so we should go I don't know hang out at any Motor Speedway but it is cool I can't deny that it is a very unique thing to have a police escort it's like I guess it's like the road equivalent of flying a private jet because this is my private car and I'm basically getting a private escort all the way to where I need to go yes pardon us we I have important business to do excuse us very important business to attend to thank you sir for holding off all traffic we have important business to attend to you know if I had to say what was my favorite memory with this s2000 really it was putting in the supercharger with Charles it was so much fun it was quite an experience learning a lot for me that guy works superfast I would like look at the next item on the to-do list and I'd be like so Charles next we got and he's like yeah Jason that's done and so that was a little embarrassing I guess on my part but he was a professional mechanic for 13 years so you know he knows what he's doing and I did a bunch of math problems in college so I guess that's to say that I don't know what I'm doing that much in a garage I enjoy learning so that's what I try to do but as far as being a professional at it no no and no so it was very it was very cool Charles came over for a week we spent that week in my garage and many parts stores for all the problems that pop up when you are working on a project and you know you run into things like rust and bolts snapping and all kinds of issues that you don't want to happen but of course will happen and it was just so much fun and it wasn't even driving the car you know but it's hanging out with Charles I really love that dude he's he's one of my best friends and putting the supercharger in with him was quite enjoyable so really good time and it's it's pretty special to be here with the M and doing this little police lap there he is right in front of us with this r32 which actually just sounds awesome all of the cars in fact here sound awesome except for this one unless I'm over about 6,000 rpm and full throttle if I'm at partial throttle and at these low RPM you know not a whole lot of noise look at all of this traffic that we are literally just saying nope we're just gonna skip by you you don't mind this is just wild it's unfair the world is unjust but anyways I'm having a good time I guess that's probably the problem Indy Motor Speedway here we go we're going out the exit so hopefully I'll get in a little interview with these guys while I'm here nothing serious because if you're with a group of friends you should talk a little trash so that's the plan let's see if we can get some interviews in here so we're here in the car with Charles Charles Travis of Volkswagen so I mean that the questions are obvious but obviously he's going yeah so I just want to see you start it up and I'm gonna look in right here alright so here we go died I can't even keep it running so what was your question your car doesn't even turn on huh it seems to be past the point of check engine light - it's so broke there's no check engine light so I got a question how many Volkswagen technicians does it take to fix a Honda's check engine light Oh trick question Honda's don't have check engine lights Joe okay we'll ask it again and I'll do a better one so Charles finally got it running and what do you know two lights for the price of one what are you driving on this road trip I am driving a 1979 Ford Fairmont that has been modified and so I'm curious why is it do you think that you have the oldest car out of the group Jason I realize you're trying to dig at my age but you're the guy with grey hair so Matt I see you brought your Mustang here it's looking really good I really like how you remove the decals and you kind of blacked it out it looks really cool how it is you know just kind of comes like that from the factory but yeah I like it it's really a cool look oh so like like what have you done do it nothing well that's fair I do actually like my Tesla and it's pretty much just straight from the factory you know thank you you have your Tesla though I got a flat tire just last week oh you know it just was a quick little thing they just pumped up the tire with some air plugged it and it was good I didn't destroy two wheels like hey guys chrisfix here how's it going Jason Chris thank you so much for joining me for a quick little chat right here usually I think the cameras are switched around but it's fine it's whatever I just got a quick question for you if you and I were to face off you know let's face it me facing you - mm your Mustang who's gonna be you know I mean it's not even really a question Chris I'm gonna be faster no Chris face the facts I'm gonna win that race now it just so happens that very shortly after challenging Chris to this race we happen to be facing off against each other as we both worked our way through the bracket for the final faceoff in a racing simulator and to no surprise Chris destroyed me so he won quite handily in that race so congratulations Chris I'm not bitter about it I don't have great excuses for why I lost however he was wearing a racing helmet and I was not wearing a racing helmet and I feel like if anyone's gonna win a racing simulator it's whoever's wearing the racing helmet so I believe that played a part but I can't say for certain that's the best excuse I have now this is engineering explain so there's going to be a white board and there's going to be some educational material in this video so we are going to learn about fuels in this case shell v-power Nitro+ which the latest formulation started development in 2015 and is now being launched in 2019 and so with this fuel the goal is to protect against gunk where corrosion and friction in this video we're going to be focusing on the friction aspect as this is the newest element of this fuel of this newest formulation of the fuel and so you might think you know what what is the need for a friction fighting element of a fuel and so today's fuel economy standards of course fuel economy is everything so if there is a way to reduce loss through heat in any way possible it is worth do and so in this case they're trying to reduce friction within the engine using the fuel and you might think well isn't that the oils job and actually from a chemical standpoint the additives used in the fuel to help reduce friction actually behaves somewhat similarly to some additives used in oils and so how these work and now instead of simply having you know bottom-up protection with your oil sprayers between your piston and your cylinder wall now you also have that top-down protection from the fuel as well and so how do these friction reducing molecules actually work so these are included within that additive package and the molecule itself has a polar head you can think of it somewhat similar to a magnet essentially it's attracted to metals and so this polar head wants to go seek out metals and then attach to that polar head is a hydrocarbon tail so as the fuel is sprayed in these friction reducing molecules want to stick to the cylinder walls as well as the Pistons and so that polar head attaches to that wall and then you have that hydrocarbon tail which is essentially an oil creating this barrier so that now you have a barrier between a metal on metal contact point to help reduce that friction now this is particularly important above that top piston ring because that top piston ring is going to be the most oil starved and so as combustion continues to occur of course you continue to inject more fuel and you're constantly replenishing this source of these friction reducing molecules to create that barrier and help reduce friction now a quick comment port injected engines are going to have better protection against deposits building up on those intake valves because that fuel injector is going to help clean off those intake valves as your engine is running now that's why you may see in many modern engines they'll have direct import injection so you can kind of have the benefits of both while still maintaining clean intake valves now which fuel should you use in your car and you might think shell would always say you know use premium fuel no matter what but in fact they don't they go with whatever the manufacturer recommends so if your manufacturer recommends regular octane gas that's what you should use if your manufacturer recommends premium gas that's what you should use and if they require premium gas then you definitely should use it because that means you could run into not if you use too low of an octane fuel so they have these same additives in all the different you know Euler mid octane or high octane fuels the difference will simply be in the percentages use so the premium fuel is going to have the highest percentage of these additives within it so it was an absolutely incredible weekend I had so much fun hanging out with everyone thank you so much to shell for putting all this together and sponsoring this video if you guys have any questions or comments please feel free to leave them below
