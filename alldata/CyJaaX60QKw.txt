so this is all by by way of saying not only is the metric system demonic uh but cause and effect is made up um in the Middle Ages people did not see history and again you could read some of Van alaskan's essays about this and he's even got a whole section on it in a history of the island that people are curious about this but in the Middle Ages people didn't see history as a series of causes and effects they saw history as a battle between good and evil which means that the most important thing in history has already happened because that was the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ yeah right but history is this battle between good and evil this is what the whole Apocalypse of Saint John is about is history seen as this conflict between good and evil in which good ultimately triumphs [Music] this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Applause] so hello everyone I am back with Richard Roland for another Universal history episode uh this week Richard is going to give us a presentation that he's prepared in another context but that is very I was very successful it is about how to read like a medieval how to look at the ancient world how to read the text how to engage with the ancient world in a way that's truthful for us today and before we start I just want to make sure you know about the Beowulf class that we are putting together Richard is going to give a a Christian reading of Beowulf that we're going to have on the symbolic World Community I will be part of it I will be taking the class and also giving some comments in the discussion and so look at the description uh there'll be a link in the description below um and we would love to see you come in this is a new thing we're doing and we're really excited about this possibility of diving in way more than what we do in just these podcasts and and helping you learn how exactly like what we're talking about today how to read these old texts how to make them relevant to you today so Richard kick us off all right well thanks Jonathan I'm very excited about both the Beowulf class which is I mean there's I think I've said this before on this on this podcast but if if I could if I had to just have one book that is the only book I could study and talk about for the rest of my life you know this is setting aside the holy Scriptures it would probably be Beowulf um so there's there's nothing that I'm more excited to talk about and to get to talk about it with you and about with all the people who have signed up to be a part of the class and a part of the live discussion everything else it's going to be great you guys can go to the symbolic world uh store I think there's a link there where you can we can get signed up for the class so uh but what we're talking about today uh this is a talk that I gave at uh father photos Parish Saint sava's Orthodox Church here in uh Allen Texas um so shout out to Father fodius who I know listens to these uh uh listens listens to to the universal history episodes um and his family uh uh they were wonderful they they you know really great church really Dynamic Parish uh if you can ever if you're ever in the north Texas area and you can check out and support the work they're doing there I think it's just incredible he has one of the most like I would say medieval churches in the area in terms of the way that they've built their building and laid out the interior and the art and the iconography that they're doing now it's just fantastic um but so this is a talk that I gave as a fundraiser for his parish and a lot of people asked for a recording it wasn't really recorded then but I wanted to do it now in the context of the the universal history uh discussion because one of the questions that I get the most often is something like okay but how do we actually read these stories like and see the things that you guys are seeing when you're when you're talking about them basically like well how do I do this at home how do I tell my kids about this stuff right when my kid asks the questions question you know okay but did dragons really exist or you know okay this thing happens in a saint story but did they really do that like how do I how do I answer that question for them and uh so what I wanted to do was try it was was to actually kind of pull back the curtain a little bit it's going to be a little bit of an apocalyptic episode this time and just talk about some of the underlying assumptions or the underlying understandings that we use when we read these old stories um and the way that we read them and maybe that'll help people kind of move in that direction so um I wanted to start with a a quote from C.S Lewis which is the which is where all Orthodox converts uh American Orthodox converts have to begin everything is with a C.S Lewis quote um this is in his essay de addendius poetis he says there are two ways of enjoying the past as there are two ways of enjoying a foreign country one man carries his carries his English re abroad with him and brings it home unchanged we could say like his americanness now because I think Americans have displaced the English as like the worst tourists but anyway um wherever he goes he consorts with the other in English tourists by a good hotel he means one that is like an English Hotel he complains that the bad tea where he might have had excellent coffee he finds the natives quaint and enjoys their quaintness in the same way there is a man who carries his modernity with him through all his reading of past literatures and preserved it preserves it intact the highlights in all ancient and medieval poetry are for him the bits that resemble or can be so read that they seem to resemble the Poetry of his own age but there's another sort of traveling and another sort of reading you can eat the local food and drink the local wines you can share the four in life you can begin to see the foreign country as it looks not to the tourist but to its inhabitants you can come home modified thinking and feeling as you did not think and feel before so with old literature you can go beyond the first impressions that a poem makes on your modern Sensibility by study of things outside the poem by comparing it with other poems by steeping yourself in the vanished period you can be then re-enter the poem with eyes more like those of the natives and so the premise uh that sort of like kicks off this our discussion today is that um the situation for us as Christians should be that the world is a foreign country right uh Saint Peter says I urge you as sojourners and Exiles I think the King James says strangers and aliens to abstain from the passions of the flesh which wage war against your soul um the world should be a foreign place to us but for most of us especially those of us who are moving out of a modern context back towards some more traditional form of Christianity right uh it's usually the reverse we've we come to the church finding it as a foreign country and uh actually I would even say uh for instance you don't hear it actually very often anymore but one of the the sometimes one of the objections that I'll hear when somebody uh visits an Eastern Orthodox church for the first time is something like oh well it's just it's too Eastern it's too difficult for the Western mind to understand et cetera Etc as though there's something like hard-coded into the Western brain you know that can't understand people going in and out of doors or something you know it's like a little it's like what what do you really mean but but but but what they're really saying though and people people don't realize this but what they're really saying is it's not modern enough yeah right it's not an East-West thing um and I've I've you know I've said many times and I I will keep saying it until I'm blue in the face that the real difference isn't East versus West it's modern versus ancient yeah right um so we we come as modern people encountering a a pre-modern church a pre-modern holy tradition and actually listen even if you're a Protestant you've got no interest in becoming Eastern Orthodox or traditional Roman Catholic or something like that the very fact that you have the Holy scriptures right which which is a pre-modern you know text or a series of pre-modern texts it is something which is actually not written for you now all scripture is written for you because it's scripture just like the Liturgy is always for you because it's the Liturgy but you weren't the original audience right um and and it was something that was created uh you know through human tools and those people that wrote those things were not uh for instance they were not 21st century Americans uh one time uh when I was uh I was teaching this is my old church before we became Orthodox I was teaching a family uh we had a sort of a family integrated Bible study so like an all ages Sunday school basically it's this one of the things that I did uh it was a great class by the way love those people love that class it was so fun uh and but one of the one you know we're going through some of the Psalms and so we come to some of these like the Royal Psalms the Psalms that have to do with like the King right and I just said hey guys just to like you know just to uh because I'm an agent of Chaos in the world I just I just you know I was like I was like Hey guys so uh you know as we get into this we're gonna read the psalm and it's about you know God Save the King right that's what the psalm is about and then at the end uh I said um now having read the psalm what would you guys say the most biblical form of government is and everyone in the class I mean there's like 40 people in this class everyone said oh obviously it's a representative Republic you know not even a democracy they said representative Republican Republic is a good good American conservatives but um but but I mean this is just I mean this is it's a little still a bit silly of an example but it's a classic example of sort of taking our frame and trying to take it to the way that we read the scriptures right um and so because we do this because we're like that first kind of tourist right we fail to realize that the holy that Holy tradition so the scripture the Liturgy the doctor and the moral law of the church um that we've received was never intended to satisfy our tastes so when we encounter things that are sort of quaint we're like oh isn't that nice they used to believe that and when we encounter things that we don't like it's because they're too strange or they're too regressive or they're too Eastern or what have you um and so the point of actually this Soul uh this whole project I would say the the entire project of my adult life has been to help people be the good kind of tourist right several people have said you know in the discussion around the universal history videos well obviously you can't just turn your your mind and you're you like you can't wind back the clock you can't just become a 13th century Russian peasant as much as maybe you would like to do and that's that's true that's true but you could at least start by becoming the good kind of tourist yeah and so the idea is to is to kind of shift from seeing the church and the scriptures as a foreign country to seeing it as our home right that all of these things including the holy scriptures are foreign to us in the sense that they're pre-modern that they're Eastern you know the Psalms were not written you know in you know Kentucky um they're ancient they're hierarchical we're modern we're post-modern we're obsessed with up to the minute relevance with being egalitarian and so when we try to Wrangle with tradition by adjusting it or rebalancing it for modern day sensibilities um uh uh instead of encountering it for what it is then it it you know we end up doing violence to it right yeah and it's also like there's also something to say that's important which is that the modern world has been the world in which Society has moved away from its faith has moved away from its attachment you know to to scripture to to Faith and so it's not surprising that in a world that was set up the day that brought us away from faith in that world it would be more difficult for us to understand the the the vehicle by which Faith was brought into into the west and so it we have to kind of humble ourselves and be careful because one of the problems that happens is that in the modern world you have two reactions you have a kind of modernism that uses modern tools like science like you know a kind of materialism a kind of rationalism to destroy the past and then you have strange people that still Embrace rationalism and materialism and a kind of that kind of attitude but then use the very tools to try to defend rights that were never meant to be that in the first place yes uh my own childhood is I mean I grew up in like a really hard line uh uh uh younger creationists like literalist uh reading of Genesis right where basically like they'll they'll take certain lines in Genesis and try to like twist them to conform to sort of hear some Fringe scientific theory right and there's a whole discussion to be had around this let's say um I certainly believe God is the maker of all things visible and invisible and uh uh really strongly uh there's something deep in my core that reacts against the myth of evolutionism right but uh the problem with this approach is the way in which it subjects the scriptures to science actually what both what both like the new atheists and the and the the younger you know uh Answers in Genesis and those folks what they both agree on is that science is the standard yeah I've heard people say science is the mind of God like in church seeing the mind of God and I was like yeah I I mean I was like 17 and I was already like uh I don't know about that that's not that's really that's not good yeah that's not great okay so uh anyway we want to help people be at least begin as being the second kind of visitor the second kind of tourist so that when we come to the church the Liturgy and to the scriptures uh we encounter them not as some kind of a foreign country that needs to change and conform to the culture that we came from but actually as our true home right as the Soul's true home so uh a one way to kind of um frame this would be to say uh is to think in terms of mirrors mirrors and windows right uh that ancient literature and ancient liturgy could either be a mirror that reflects our own faces back to us where we sort of see the things we're looking for or it could be a window through which we gaze upon Paradise upon the Stars upon the Heavenly City upon the love that moves the sun and the other stars as Dante would say right and so that's kind of the goal here is to cultivate this I'll explain this at the end but this mystogogical vision of the cosmos so this being said uh there are four things that I would put forward as these are shifts you must make if you're going to read any ancient literature let's say let's say pre-modern literature because it's it's really ancient and medieval right so if you're going to read any pre-modern literature and really read it charitably there are kind of four shifts that you kind of have to adopt so the first is a shift in the way that we think about authorship and originality yeah um and this is where uh this is where a lot of the damage was done before people realized what was happening um starting in the 19th century so we have this we have this discipline called signed uh called sexual criticism um and uh on its own it's just a set of tools for figuring out when something was written and who wrote it um and so in that sense you know like like many tools it could be used in a good way I have you know in my in my own academic career I have engaged in textual criticism specifically in and around Old Norse poetry um uh and actually some version of this has existed since the ancient world right famously origin you know one of the most important you know his most important contributions to the tradition was essentially worked of textual criticism uh looking you know comparing the Septuagint to the Hebrew Old Testament right um people have always known that there were difficulties presented by manuscripts and that manuscripts contradicted each other like people weren't stupid um it's true that literacy rates were generally lower although not as low as people sometimes think they were but people who were illiterate read a lot more than we do today like we live in a post-literate society where we think we can read because we can read like a tweet or a an X I don't even know what we call them anymore um uh but like we think we're literate because we can read like a status update or you know a headline or something like that but actually most of us just read two sentences and we skip to the next paragraph when we read those first two sentences and so on right we're actually sort of post-literate but uh people who could read in pre-modern times read deeply they read deeply so they noticed these differences they noticed way more differences actually sometimes I'll be reading along like in in the you know um something like the ambigua which is all about these difficulties in you know written by Saint Maximus or something like that some some text like I'll be reading along anybody like ah now here we clearly have what what appears to be a a difference between this gospel writer and this gospel right and I'm looking and I'm like well it doesn't really actually seem like is a difference to me right they were much more precise in in the ways that they look for these things so people always knew and people always understood that that there were things like translation errors copyist errors right which could render a phrase difficult to understand but the pre-modern Mind saw these difficulties as being providential actually as as uh an indication that there is some deeper meaning the reader was intended by the Holy Spirit to unearth it's like uh it's like the uh say like like the corner of a treasure chest poking up out of the ground and you walk along you trip across it and then you notice oh there's some buried treasure right here yeah but and and I and I want to defend that very precisely for people because people might think that it's just a cope uh you know and I think that you can actually structurally you can understand it which is that imagine uh a story that you tell and that you have to remember and one of the things that makes you help remember a story is it's just general coherence it's like if it makes sense then you remember it better like if it makes sense then you can attend to it more easily but the fact that in stories that are very ancient certain quirky details that are are so weird are maintained in the story means that there had to be great effort to to remember that you know and so I I mentioned that for example like in in a very simple one that has nothing to do with like the with scripture itself but in for example in Translation uh about texts about Saint Christopher there was this weird change that happened between the idea of Canaanite like from Canaan and then Kanan like in terms of dog Canaanites in terms of dog and and the the people interpreting it says well it's all ridiculous because it's just a mistake in transcription but if if someone had made a mistake in transcription and that mistaken transcription made absolutely no sense it would have been corrected in the next iteration but if there's something about it that is holding then maybe that that that mistake is then continued on mistake it's not a mistake it is something like a providential transformation of the text and so we it I know it's hard for people to understand that if things are remembered and intended to even though they're weird it means there's something hidden underneath it and so that's what that's how the church fathers would see it it's like there's some weird detail that's so strange that doesn't seem to make sense like why is it there if it's maintained there and uh this is actually I mean the the best example for this is just to understand this is why we have four gospels not one I mean it actually sort of is the one gospel right but it but we have four gospel accounts let me put it that way yeah um so actually it's not the first book of the New Testament it's not Matthew it is The Gospel According to Saint Matthew right um this is how it's said liturgically and even when I speak about it in like teaching class and things like that I always try to use that precise language because it's the one gospel and in fact we collect all four accounts into a single book in the Orthodox Church which we call the gospel book which we we parade around and we kiss and we venerate we read from and everything so it's the one gospel right this verbal icon of Christ is how the fathers speak of it but we have four accounts and those four accounts have these sort of subtle differences sometimes major differences but um there were attempts actually even quite early on to create a single harmonized gospel account you notations uh attempt is the most famous but a lot of people tried this and actually the church rejected it right the church rejected it um if we wanted just a single synthesized smooth account we could have had it right we could have kept it we could have just picked one of the four gospels at any given point time or we could have made our own you know our own version that you know smoothed out all the differences included all the parts if we wanted that we could have had it but it was not God's Will and it was not you know what the church agreed upon to have that we have four gospel accounts and some of these gospel accounts have subtle differences actually if you look at um I'll I'll tease something which I won't pay off and so people will have to go dig themselves for it um as as as I think uh you know this is this is this is how Christ teaches so I there's precedent for it um so the thing that I'll tease did not pay off is that if you go and look at the account of how the murder bearing women come to the Tomb in the synoptic gospels it's uh it's a little bit different in each version and the list of who's there and who's not there and the timing Mary Magdalene coming and and the apostles it's all just like there are these little subtle differences but if you go and you read for instance Saint Greg of palomas's homilies on these texts on the resurrection there is actually a really beautiful mystery that Saint Gregory and actually other Church fathers saw uh as being hidden as sort of being hidden there within the gospels concerning um concerning the resurrection and the mother of God so I won't explain what that is but I'll encourage people to go out and kind of research it for themselves okay so the the so this is this is like one commonplace example but you could basically say if you wanted to boil down uh this this pretty modern approach to authorship you could say uh that they that they approached it this way first of all they approached reading with credulity credulity that is they believe that the author loves you uh because producing a book is an act of love right books are extremely expensive in the ancient world they they create they they represent um not just a lot of time and training that would have to go into somebody skilled enough to produce a book but also like the the Lost Economic Opportunity because most books are written on the on the on the skins of young animals right sheep and and cattle specifically well if I kill a young calf that's a calf that's now out of my breeding pool I can't ever get meat from that calf I can't ever get milk from that you know I can't get any of that stuff right um so he presents a tremendous like lost opportunity um and so this is actually why for instance as you and if you look at Medieval text the farther north you go um in other words the poor people get and the the more uh scarce like animals become uh the more abbreviations are used in the texts and so by the time you get to Iceland it's like they have an abbreviation for almost every word it's a total nightmare like if you read like you know you know stuff you know uh written on the continent it's in this beautiful Carolinian minuscule and it's super legible and you can basically just read it off the page and then you look at something that's happening like 600 years later in Iceland and it's almost completely illegible unless you have a magnifying glass why because they're trying to save paper right they're trying to save paper so um creating a book is an act of love the pre-modern approach to reading is first of all this with an assumption that the author loves you and then the assumption that the Holy Spirit has guided the process not only of composition which the the sort of fundamentalist world that I grew up in are really big on this the Holy Spirit has guided the process of the composition of the scriptures although in the Middle Ages they would have actually said this is true for all good books um it's especially true for scripture but it's true for all good books but um the holy spirit is guided not only the process of composition but also that of transmission right so that the Bible that you have is the Bible that you have not some easier version of the Bible not some version of the Bible that you would have made to satisfy like modern questions and concerns uh because that's what the Holy Spirit has has given you right and so at the end of the day they would see the book as a gift received from Authority that's what the book is it's a it's a gift in fact our word Authority right has is the same root as author right so a book is a gift received from Authority um in the modern world right with this the discipline of textual criticism is uh is used to look for these differences between texts no matter how minute they are right and use them to propose propose new theories why new theories because people have to write dissertations you got to get published right you can't get published saying something somebody's already said so you got to come up with a new Theory and so it's used to propose new theories about the age authorship Providence of of text and of course sacred text among them and at its worst and and obviously this is again it's a useful discipline um it's something that I do and engage in on a regular basis but at its worst This Modern way of reading sees differences and difficulties as being something worse than mistakes right uh at their accidental tells that someone is being dishonest with you that somebody's trying to pull the wall over your eyes and so there's this idea that on the one hand the apostles were these Master con men right these Master con men they're fooling everybody into this construct of Jesus of Nazareth that this new religion they started but then on the other hand they're so bad at their job that they didn't notice their own you know you know they couldn't get their stories straight right it's just it's a little obviously I think it's a little ludicrous right but the assumptions of this way of reading in contrast to the pre-modern way of reading are first of all suspicion right there's an inherent hermeneutic of Suspicion the author has an agenda and then usually this idea that historical forces uh I say in in my most Marxist accent possible right uh that economic political social forces guided not the Holy Spirit but these forces these forces guided both the composition and the transmission of the work and so the book goes from being a gift received from Authority and it becomes a text received from an author right a text received from an author received from like patriarchal you know power yes well that that's really that's really that's when post-modernism comes in right and so this this this modern way of reading focused on uh first and foremost on authorship it's the most interesting question because if we can know when someone lived and what their social economic circumstances were then we're better able to understand the agenda of the text but what post-modernism does is it comes in it deconstructs the modern way of reading further because it assumes uh basically liquidity um uh the author is dead right the this whole death of the office thing the author is dead and therefore any agenda that they might have had you you don't actually need to know or care about that because this book the book is now a fluid reality which can be manipulated to serve to redistribute social and economic power via various critical lenses and so this is when you get into well let's do a a let's do a post-colonial reading of Beowulf which is a real thing that somebody has done you know well did anybody writing Beowulf have postcolonialism or even colonialism in mind yeah but the disease is already there in the modern things no it is it is yeah because in the modern way of thinking what they would want to do is show how the let's say the the power structure whether it's from a Marxist point of view or some something akin to that is embedded in the text and the fact that it was Authority authoritative means that it participated in in maintaining certain social orders that were important for the people of the day and so they'll tend to look into the text and like to see the preservation like if you look at some of the Old Testament title critical writing they see it as a conflict of different groups and different political factions and that there's this like conflict that you can find inside the text that's showing a political conflict within Israel at the time and the big problem that I am currently having with a lot of let's say uh broadly conservative reactions to post-modernity is that they are trying to get back to modernity yeah and this is this is just it's it's not far enough right it's not far enough for us as Christians that's not that's not an acceptable solution yeah yeah um so to talk a little bit about the idea of like authorship uh the the authorship in the ancient world was always understood as as being a a composite thing this is part of why like the these these like modern the modern hyper fixation on oh well there's this group in the text and this group of the text like you're just saying this is like sort of missing the point from a pre-modern perspective because uh well first of all putting the name of an established Authority on a work let's say for instance the Old Testament book The Wisdom of Solomon um uh this was often uh this is a this is a link with the chain of tradition right it's not always an absolute statement about the origin of every syllable in the works in the case of the wisdom of Solomon nobody thought that Solomon wrote wrote it I mean it was everybody do it had been written much later um but they named it that why because it's in the solomonic wisdom tradition that goes back to Proverbs you've got the Proverbs of Solomon did Solomon write all of the Proverbs of Solomon according to the Proverbs of Solomon he did not well but we still call them and the way that we still call the Psalms the Psalms of David right David is the author of The psalter even though if you in the actual text he's not the author of every single one of the Psalms um this is again this is not a problem for anybody before the 19th century like nobody cares like like we understand what we mean when we say this right uh so if somebody wants to say if somebody wants to say there's like a uh uh you know there's like a little bit of you know uh oh this later thing was added to one of the Books of Moses for instance right well like the description of his death for example that's right right yeah which is that someone else wrote the description of Moses death right right whatever who cares right not is that is that a problem for anybody no not really right um because again we the pre-modern uh uh person trusts that the holy spirit is guided not just the process of composition but also the process of transmission and so this is even when you get into like um there are certain pericapes in The Gospel According to Saint John specifically the the one concerning the woman caught in adultery right which doesn't show up in some ancient manuscripts right and so then you could sort of ask the question well you know is this originally part of the Gospel or not and actually for our purposes it doesn't matter what matters is uh is that you know this is this is something at somewhere in the in the process of transmission right which the Holy Spirit oversaw this this story is one of the stories that's in this Gospel According to Saint John it's in this yonian tradition and and then you would just look at well how did how how how does the church how do we use this you know liturgically and that sort of will kind of clear up some of those questions so um now sacred texts were copied with a great deal of fidelity uh but the farther out you get from Holy Scripture the more likely there are it is for major changes to be introduced so a good example of this in in an essay of his uh called The Genesis of the medieval book which is really important essay that I think everybody's interested in these things should read C.S Lewis uh uses the iterations of the Arthurian tales and you say he starts with just Jeffrey of Monmouth as an example who just includes a little bit of King Arthur in his overall annals right and then uh you've got waist and then uh and then lion coming along and enlarging and massively improving on what Jeffrey did right and it was understood that this is sort of like oh let's say uh uh far enough out in the north X as it were right you know near enough to the base of the mountain that you have the ability to kind of improve things but also bring in things that you've heard that the previous author maybe hadn't and stuff like that right um and so the way to think about a medieval book or a pre-modern book is that it's a cathedral right um every great cathedral built in the Middle Ages was built over the course of one two in one case 600 years right well you're gonna start building a building that is going to be finished by your grandchildren and great grandchildren who are going to have totally different architectural tastes than you you do right and so these great medieval Cathedrals a lot of times you'll have well this bit was done here and this bit was done at this time and this bit was done at this time and so everything like sort of doesn't match but at the same time it totally goes together right because it it just sort of grew up in this organic way right but if you wanted to try to pick through and pull out and try to pull out the pieces that that you could say well this is the original Cathedral then the building just collapses right and this is the kind of the same way that medieval books work um so Eugene vodolaskin who you've had at the channel before um who's uh you know a wonderful wonderful uh fiction author um I'll Hawk his new book once again uh uh uh the history of the island which is actually a it is a work of you of medieval Universal history as a novel and it's uh it's just fantastic so uh people should go read it but um he said uh in a really important essay of his called the Middle Ages he said that it's important to note that there's a spectrum here that the stability of a medieval text depended in large part on its closeness to the Holy Scripture the primary book in the Middle Ages the Holy Scripture the text of texts standing at the Center of Spiritual life had a special fate any new manuscript copy of the Holy scriptures was produced by drawing not on one but on two or more manuscripts the scribes looked after the Integrity of the Holy text by comparing manuscripts correcting possible errors and deviations from the canonical text at the other end of the spectrum that ends with maximal distance from the sacred one can see that the text changed significantly when reproduced and everybody was okay with this yeah right what What mattered wasn't um so much who says something but what was said you could say and so they don't really have in the Middle Ages they don't really have this idea of plagiarism and in fact they don't really have a strong notion of authorship um most medieval authors simply did not sign their work unless they were a very important person like one of the church fathers or um you know an emperor or something like that who who had um like the spiritual or social right to do so but for most most medieval authors the idea that you would sign your work would be seen as kind of like a an act of pride so that's the first thing is the shift in the way that we approach uh that we approach the question of authorship and transmission and if we can actually just make that one shift then 90 of people's problems and like Hang-Ups and things like this especially the kind of Hang-Ups that very smart people tend to have will go away and then you can actually start reading the text right it's the I always crack up whenever like I buy a new edition of some protistic text or medieval poem or something like that and the actual text itself is not that long it's maybe 80 pages but then before the before the 80 Pages you have 150 pages of critical analysis of here's what the guy who put this book together you know basically this is his PhD dissertation here's what he thinks about the text right and it's sort of clear by volume which thing is the more important in terms of what's being published all right so the second thing that I would want to kind of point out is as a necessary necessary shift this is a much shorter Point um is the meanings of words and things right because modernism is a flattening and a separation of space and time we'll talk about that a little more in a moment uh but it also tends to flatten out meaning as well so as such modernism is usually capable of understanding something as either being literal which by which we mean being understood as most obvious materialistic sense like a measurable taxonomical category usually something like if you had a camera yeah right but of course of course this this itself is a bad test right because we all know perfectly well uh from recent events that you can have a camera on site and half the people watching the video see what's going on see two totally different things right you know yeah um so that during the trucker protest very clearly yeah it's just trucker protest uh I mean lots of other things you know like almost any tragedy that gets done for political purposes or whatever somebody will have a video of what happened and half the people who watch it see one thing and the other half who watch it see the other thing but anyway uh but modern people will uh uh are usually capable of understanding something is either being literal or allegorical which by which they mean having a symbolic meeting and that's that's what the thing we you know we we hit that all the time on the symbolic world because at the outset when I started talking about these things yeah I would just get backlashes of people saying oh you're saying it's all allegorical it's all metaphor you know and I'm like I'm not saying any of those things but I still remember your there is no such thing as literal video yeah yeah which is like purely medieval like in the sense that that we're talking about now which is that they're they're you know it's like the this idea of like this objective reality that is completely neutral of of of importance it's like even in the modern world even though we have that category in the modern world it it falls apart very fast right and so this is this is I think one of the things that um that this one in the next I I would say the next three things like there are four things these next three things are the things that your channel has probably done the most open people's eyes on like this this understanding like if you can just see that things can mean more than one thing right uh that words could mean more than one thing but also that things that that the things that exist on the world have meaning they have significance um uh that you know you can have a tree right and the tree is you could say in some in some objective secularist reality right the the tree is just it's just an arbitrary organism but actually even materialists don't usually think this way because uh because they'll be oh well you can't trees are good for the environment right you can't cut down trees but actually if if we're if we're doing a secularist materialist devoid of meaning the tree is just an organism it's its existence is just as arbitrary as every other organisms right so unless I give it meaning there's no reason I can't cut it down yeah right um so medieval people believed um I just read that quote from but Alaskan uh because they believe that uh everything they wrote and read was uh no matter what its style to some degree a continuation or a concretization of the Holy scriptures right because they believe this they believe that books could have multiple complementary layers of meaning a very simple uh uh we just uh for orthodox Christians um actually old calendar new calendar both would have recently finished the dormition fast so every year doing the dermission fast my family reads um the life of the Virgin by Saint Maximus the Confessor which is his sort of hagiography of the life of the mother of God and uh early on in it you know he's talking about Psalm the 44th Psalm you know the Queens did it thy right hand quote then and you know and this is the this is like one of the primary you know Psalms one of the primary Old Testament passages that the church sees and historically all Christians have seen as uh as talking about the mother of God and uh and he says but if you find somebody who says that the queen in this passage actually is the church there's no problem with that because first of all she is the church and secondly and then he says words authored by the Holy Spirit ought not to be understood as having only one meaning um wow very very just very very simple words authored by the Holy Spirit ought not to be understood as having only one meaning right um and so uh in the Middle Ages this eventually develops into something that probably most people who have taken some kind of a class on like the Middle Ages or read like Augustine's confed Saint Augustine's confessions in school or something like that will be familiar with and that is the four-fold sense right uh and there's like there's actually even fun little Latin mnemonic poems to help people remember this right but basically it's the literal uh we could say historical might be a better way of of phrasing that right here's what happened in history right um although even that is is maybe a little fraught but let's just say like this is what happened in history this is how it was recorded this this is the event that was recorded right that's that's what that is then there's the typological which would be uh uh in what way does this text uh this story or this symbol or something like that in what way does it connect with the Life of Christ with uh the life of his mother with the life of the church Etc so a very good example is something like um you know the Old Testament the serpent in the wilderness right the Brazen serpent well on the historical level God told Moses to make a serpent right this is the literal reading okay God told Moses to make a bronze serpent he lifts it up on a pole and everybody who looks at it or touches it is healed now on its own that doesn't actually have a whole lot of meaning right it's just here's God gave you instructions to do an arbitrary thing yeah and I always did it I always take the literal meaning as like the way we talk about literally mean it's just like getting the facts right right they're just getting this is what the text says like this right text says this because one of the problems with sometimes with with in a negative sense we call allegorical reading is that people gloss the text yes they don't pay attention to it uh carefully they just kind of gloss over it and then give this like high meaning but I think it's really important even in symbolic interpretation like that you stay that you get the text right you get 100 you get everything there right yeah so so in the in that case here's the historical event God told Moses to do a thing Moses did the thing people were healed right but then there's a typological significance which has to do with the lifting up of Christ on the cross uh this one is is easy because Christ himself explained it to us right um which we don't always get we don't always get um and then the third level is what sometimes called the moral or the tropological level um and moral as in this is the moral of the story in other words because this happened here's how you should behave right that's the moral of the story um this is any one of these Levels by the way is like a fine level but if you treat it like it's the only one then you get like an awful version of the story so for instance uh there's a lot of like mingling of traditional fairy tales because people were you know fairy tales which were not traditionally just stories for children yeah but in the Victorian period when they try to make them into just stories for children they would always rewrite them with this sense of and then here's the moral at the end yeah right and so it's just like it just like saps the Vitality out of the story which is actually mostly happening on the typological level right um um and then the finally the fourth level that that they would see would be was sometimes called the the anagogical or the eschatological level which is basically connecting the text with last things the end of the world or the end of a pattern the end of a cycle or most importantly probably at the end of your life right um and uh it's important to note that people didn't just use these senses to read the scriptures yeah they actually use them to read Homer and they use them to read everything and they would actually say you could read The Odyssey and there's a typological sense in which you can apply the Odyssey to the Life of Christ yeah right and they a hundred percent sincerely believed that um and what I'm sort of you know obviously trying to imply is that you can do this too you can do it with something like Lord of the Rings I've got a whole podcast where that's what we do um so but in the same way uh things can mean uh not just words but also themes like like the things that you encounter in the world can mean more than one thing right again rocks trees basic things like that um uh my favorite example honestly is is Bread and Wine right you know part of the whole symbolic literal argument you know around the the Eucharist in the Christian you know West over the last 500 years 600 years now has has been because um people sort of see well it can only be one thing like it can only it can be bread and the blood and body right at the same time right you have to like we have to collapse it to the body and then make the bread whether they call it like just like details like like uh yeah accidents or whatever accidental that's right that's the word yeah so uh one of my favorite things that Dante wrote is actually a series of letters oh I gotta plug my computer in um is a series of letters that he wrote actually explaining the Divine Comedy uh which is uh which is nice again when the author like gives you an explanation of his own thing pay attention he may be wrong uh you know but but still you should pay attention so uh what what he says is that we should call it that is um writing polysemus that is of many senses first sense derives from the letters themselves a second from the things signified by the letters we call the first sense literal so he gives his own explanation for for this and then he gives an example from the comedy so to clarify this method of treatment consider this verse when Israel went out from Egypt the house of Jacob from a barbarous people Judea was made to Sanctuary Israel his Dominion which by the way that's the psalm the P that the souls seeing when they are being brought to the mountain of purgatory at the beginning of purgatorio he says now if we examine the letters alone The Exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified that's the letter that's the level of the letter we we call the literal meaning right in the allegory it's our Redemption is accomplished through Christ uh so that's the typological sense in the moral sense the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the State of Grace so this is how I should behave because of this and then in the anagogical or the eschatological sense The Exodus of the Holy Soul from the slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory they can all be called and then he says they can all be called symbolic right of course he means something different by that than most of us mean today but um and but this is actually how he uses the psalm in the comedy because if you pay attention to those early cantos of purgatory that's actually what is happening is all four of those things it's it's you know remembering this time God delivered his people but also in the moral sense it's the conversion of Dante's soul from the grief and misery of his own sin right and and so on so that's the that's the second thing that I would want to help people make this shift on is that is the meaning of words and things right and their abilities to kind of have uh uh that the world itself is symbolic the world itself is polysemous and and that these connections are not arbitrary which is yeah but they're not arbitrary is very important because this is something that we run into with postmodernism which is that post-modernism argues for polysemy as well but they argue for free-floating polysemy so like the idea is that is that you have multiple meanings but those multiple meanings are disconnected from each other and there isn't let's say an underlying uh analogy between the different levels of meanings and so and interestingly enough is that because of that when now people like you and I argue for polysemy people accuse us of being post-modern because that's where they've heard that and they're like well how can it have several meanings it means that everything's going to blow up and then right we don't know what's real and it's all made up and it's all in your mind and it's all that but it's like no it's not it's it's neither of those the the police the the polythemic aspect of a text is all directed right it's all directed towards the truth and that's what makes the different levels uh cohere together so when Dante presents his different levels of what he means by that Psalm though it it's not they're not disconnected they're just different levels of the same meaning uh the different levels of the same truth and it's because they had a uh you say the pattern or the interpretive map that they're using or both the book of the scriptures and also the book of creation right is the passion and resurrection of Jesus Christ yeah right that's the central thing uh that you have to take as completely um necessary to this entire model right um that uh without it without it um almost all Western literature just becomes incoherent right even fairy tales even fairy tales most of the the fairy tales written by The Brothers Grimm and I'm talking like the first edition that had all the gnarly stuff in it before they kind of you know made it polite later yeah but but the the the the the uh all those fairy tales right those fairy tales actually have the gospel story encoded within them right on the typological level and that doesn't mean it had to be a deliberate thing right that this is just you know uh I am I mean you're you're you're your thing that you say right this is how the world lays itself out yeah right this is this is the way that things are right and that's really that's really important because especially and it's weird because a lot of people have done the opposite which is to try to make the fairy tales into non-Christian things and usually what they they mean by that is because the the fairy tales are immoral often actually they aren't actually they actually aren't usually about just like uh or whatever they're quite amoral they're quite mythological and they can be quite jarring but the truth is that like read the story of Samson again I read the Book of Judges this is actually part of our tradition you know the idea that everything has to be clean and moral and and Puritan is ridiculous it's just not part of the tradition at all like the the these gnarly and kind of weird Stories the way that people read Homer there's there's very weird stuff in Homer but they could nonetheless or they could read Plato people could read the Symposium and even though it had all this kind of dark stuff they could see that there were still glimmers shining through it you know without having to accept things this as just being an example of more or less than about this or that that's that's beautifully put um yeah this is this is like this is the big thing that we gotta people to sort of understand because even then uh actually something that's sort of come up recently now I'm off the reservation I'm off my notes but uh is is the way that the way that somebody could read and be offended by like a saint story like a work of how geography right there's like weird sometimes shocking stuff to Modern sensibilities in the Saints lives if you don't think that then you just haven't read enough of them yeah um and so this sort of like we have this kind of idea of here's what like a like a clean polite well-behaved right Christian person is supposed to look like and it's basically the product of basically it's like the 1950s right yeah you know like like it's it's like at least in this country we have like 1950s America in our head right you know that's the that's that's our gold that era so that's where we go back to and we're like you know this the lawn's got to be neatly trimmed and uh you know you know all that stuff and uh man it's it's you know it just the the tradition is so much uh uh weirder than that it's so much more dangerous than that you know uh uh and uh um this is you know again this is not to say you know I mean nobody nobody who knows me would think for a moment that I'm you know running down like the moral teachings of the church or anything like that no and nothing like that but but to say that that actually if you if you go and look at actually what the tradition is you know in literature in the church in our hagiography in the scriptures all these things if you look at what it is it's not that it's not that just sort of clean it's not that just sort of like clean you know the lawn is perfectly cut and and you've got the two kids one boy and one girl and like just that whole like sort of black and white image of here's what perfect life you know is supposed to be if you're a good person you go to church on Sundays um and and uh this is where this is where fairy tales really fit into things but they they would have read those stories um and they would have read but they would have also read Homer and they would have also read even like the the North Smith right um uh there's some great work uh that's been written we're going to talk about it some in the veil of glass people uh there's been some great stuff that's written about how Christians when they you know the Scandinavian and Germanic Christians when they converted they were able to look at things like idrisil right the tree of life right the world tree right and then to sort of see it as the cross right and and then and then develop a really beautiful poetic tradition around the cross which is actually deeply consonant with the Byzantine poetic tradition around the cross um so we'll we'll talk about some of those things in the Beowulf class but uh just to move on real quick because I know we're like way over the normal time for these kinds of things um the third thing that you need to understand um and and again this is something that you have been trying to tell people and I think effectively telling people for years is that heaven is above and hell is beneath um the medieval vision of the cosmos is not geocentric right that is the world at the center it is uh rather the Earth at the bottom right and so you you get this very clearly in Dante um where uh you've got the uh the the uh the outer Heaven the Empire right where God dwells right uh the Divine Rose the beauty of everything sort of like about like reality bounces back in on itself like a mirror image and it's God it's centered everything around him right but then you have these various tiers the various you know different Heavens right these different Heavens uh the heaven uh uh of the fixed stars and Saturn and uh Joe or Jupiter and Mars and soul the Sun and Venus and Mercury and the moon and then beneath the moon um and basically in the Middle Ages the really important barrier is the barrier of the Moon right things beneath the moon can change it's the world of time it's the world where repentance is possible but it's also the world where things die and decay beyond the Moon is things are fixed and things move in Kind of Perfect order right um and so in in Dante's Divine Comedy when Lucifer when the devil is cast out of Heaven he's cast down to earth why is he cast down to earth and not some other place which would actually be a perfectly good question to ask if you had like a copernican model of the universe right why not why why Earth well it's very simple answer and Dot in in in the the the bottoms it's the bottom it's as far down as you can go so Lucifer is cast down to earth and when he lands his body makes a pit because basically the Earth hates him and is trying to get out of his way right so he lands and everything is like sort of thrown up and the the dirt is thrown up on the other side of the planet that becomes the amount of purgatory uh and then Satan eventually lands at the center of the earth why at the center of the Earth because in this uh you could say like geography yeah uh this is as far away as you can get from God that's the lowest point yeah the lowest point so man did Medieval man did not see himself as standing at the center of the universe he saw himself as standing at the bottom of a great stairway looking up towards God and of course the uh the the the the the medieval uh medieval man understood the entire human life as the Soul's elongating a desire to return to God uh who had made it right and so it's really easy to remember this if we remember two things one is that in the Middle Ages nobody believed the World is Flat uh it wasn't like people all thought the world was flat until Christopher Columbus or whoever sailed around it proved you know like oh my gosh are there really still people that think that I die I still run into it people are like oh Columbus proved the world was rounded I'm like no he didn't the Greeks proved the world was round and they did it with math and they did it you know 4 000 years ago and anyway uh but then also the other thing is the other thing is uh and this here's my little Ender's Game reference for Anders game fans out there like we just remember the enemy's gate is down um that is that is you know hell is down right the the center of the earth right um and so in the medieval cosmology there's no such thing as outer space doesn't exist not to say they didn't know that their stars played as comets Supernova Etc but there's no such thing as outer space this vast empty Blackness where everything is just sort of arbitrary and Neil deGrasse tysony just kind of floating out there right um I actually have a theory about that is that when we switch to the copernican model outer space becomes the limits of the earth it actually flips it inverts weirdly and and everything that used to happen on the edge of the of the world is now projected into outer space if you watch that movie Gravity it's really actually wonderful like in terms of that Cosmic sense it represents outer space as this like place of death and strangeness that is outside the bound world and and and basically like it's it's related to going into the water that's why at the end of the movie She's in this in this thing and she encounters Saint Christopher and she encounters like this like weird place where she doesn't understand Chinese and then finally she dives into the bottom of the water and comes out like Resurrection it's like that's a real good understanding of what outer space is really yeah the the you know the one of the other you know really strong ancient images um including for like the um through Germanic people so we're gonna talk about this in the Beowulf us um the way that they they they saw the world as you know as as midden yard right the Middle Earth surrounded by the encircling sea right and there's where the C is like this is the abyss this is the thing you can't like God is over there on the other side somewhere right that's basically what space became for us when that switch happened yeah exactly yeah yep um so in this conception of the world the world moves and is moved by love right Dante again has this wonderful phrase at the very end of a comedy uh it's referring to God as the love that moves the sun and the other stars so in in the discarded image CS Lewis makes a really great point about this he says that in the modern world we conceive of a universe governed by laws right we have the law of universal gravitation the law of conservation of energy the second law of Thermodynamics right um and one of the things that basically post-modernity does is it starts to break down this vision of the universe even even at the level like quantum physics which again this is all stuff you've talked about um but it breaks down this this idea of a world that's like totally governed and kind of predictable and determinable governed by laws and now we're actually saying perception is part of the you know actually affects you know reality on a Quantum level you know whatever that means right uh but it's got no compelling alternative yeah with which reality could be Unified and in the Middle Ages they understood the world as uh being held together and moved by love which you could say is is um held in a world that's actually held and moved together by attention yeah right and so um uh Jeffrey Chaucer in his his uh poem The House of Fame which is not one of the Chaucer stories that you read in high school I don't know why you know I guess it's because the teenagers we figure teenagers can handle like the body humor of of the Canterbury Tales and maybe that'll be more fun for them uh but in the house of Fame um which which among other things uh involves this this man sort of ascending up through the Spheres right um it's being you know he's asking questions about how the medieval Universe Works the way it does and he's told that every I'll just quote from it here every kindly thing kindly as in the sense of according to its kind not as in the sense of nice yeah nice so every everything according to His Kind every kindly thing that is Hatha kindly stead that is a home there hey he may best in it conservative B um unto which place everything through his kindly inclining moveth forward to come to so things move in the universe things move in the cosmos by um by this process of basically everything trying to get back to where it belongs so why does water sit on top of the Earth because water belongs here and the Earth belongs here if I drop the stone in water why will it go down Newton was not the first person to notice that apples fall from trees or whatever right you know be like gosh no one's ever noticed this before you know but the explanation that they would have given it was the Apple Falls because it's made of Earth and it's trying to get back to where it came from and of course Lewis I'll give another Lewis quote he says we could ask the medieval scientists this is silly why are you talking this way do you really think that a rock really loves the Earth like whatever and he would we could retort or he could retort with a counter question but do you intend your language about laws and obedience any more literally than I intend mine about kindly inclining in other words is there like a cosmic traffic court where if you disobey the law of gravity like you get a ticket like how is how does this work how does this work but what Lewis says is that on the imaginative and emotional level it makes a great difference whether we with the medievals uh we project upon the Universe um our strivings and desires or with the moderns our police system and our traffic regulations like what do you want to live in uh a cosmic police State uh which is even affected the ways that we think about Christianity like the reduction of Christianity to basically just moralism yeah um I mean I've talked about this elsewhere but I grew up in this you know fundamentalist group or sect that among other things believe that the Bible is a set of laws of the set of principles what they called them and if you live by these things then your life will go well and that they're as immutable and as provable as like the law of gravity I mean they would have said that right and so uh do we want to live in a world in a cosmos that's governed by love or or in one that's essentially a police state all right so the last thing I want to talk about is space and time um so I'm going to read here a quote from zigmund Bauman's liquid modernity which is a an incredible book if people haven't read it um it uh by liquid zigmund Bauman means that it is uh modernity can't hold a shape it can't hold form so he says that modernity starts when space and time are separated from living practice and from each other and so become ready to be theorized as distinct and mutually independent categories of strategy and action when they cease to be as they used to be in long pre-modern centuries the intertwined and so barely distinguishable aspects of the living experience locked in a stable and apparently invulnerable one-to-one correspondence when I read this paragraph I was just like oh it's Matthew's book and it's like everything Jonathan has been saying for years it's like but somebody else somebody else is saying it um so modernity basically is the separation of space and time it's becoming two sort of separate things right and I think that you can tell me what you think about this because I'm still kind of noodling on this idea but I think at post-modernity could be understood as a further Corruption of this that once space and time are measured separated categorized they eventually cease to have any meaning at all and then we deconstruct them in order to kind of show how absurd they are right um I think about this a lot when I'm driving around in my car because like it's the most absurd sort of separation of space and time the fact that I can be somewhere you know 100 miles away I can be there in an hour and a half yeah well for sure the the technology has made this problem excessively great in the same way that in your car you have that experience we have the experience now like look at what we're doing right now right yes right yeah there's there's nothing important like break nothing would breaks this sense of space as this Zoom conversation you know yeah that's a good point I think that I think that um deconstruction is at its heart it's a reaction to this absurdity and it's like a it's like an immune response um I mean I mean uh this is I did not intend today to be the day that I've explained why the metric system was embedded by demons but um the the but but but but uh uh as you know here in America we stubbornly refuse I'll measure things in Universal standard giraffes before I use the metric system like like oh that's three giraffes long like I'll I'll go there before I before I succumb to the use of the metric system but I mean the but if you think about the metric system basically the idea is hey let's measure the Earth yeah at a certain point that we've arbitrarily determined let's measure everything yeah and then divide it up into regular sections and that's going to be our base unit of measurement from now on and it used to be like a certain piece of metal that they had to keep at a certain temperature because actually if you get it out in the real world it'll stop being that precise length and now I think they use like lasers or something but anyway the the point it's really important what you're saying because this is you know the the the the traditional way of measuring which is clunky and it's difficult is nonetheless based on human experience it's clunky and difficult but it's also easy and intuitive yeah right uh at a very base level to say how many feet is this well I've got a foot I can check right and and most of the time that's going to be good enough for most most applications right um uh an inch right well I've got it right it's a cubit I've got an arm uh you know um uh but but even like measurements of time like like so many people have tried to monkey with the way that we measure time and it's like like we'll we'll let you do the metric system with space but when like no Evolution when they tried to introduce like the 10-day week you just can't do it you just can't do it like everybody has a seven day week like it's it's completely you know uh it's one of the most immutable things about The Human Experience yeah and I mean just separating time into four quadrants of sun and dark like light and darkness and sun and moon even so in in in the the let's say over the variation it changes it's like you just can't change you just can't change that right yes it's yeah so it's this but this is this is the the kind of ways that you this sort of idea that if we sort of measure and quantify everything yeah right then we we can control it and then everything is certain right this this basic idea what it what it does is it separates time from space right because it separates space from any kind of experience of that space in a way that you know human beings would use it um so what father father Silvio bunta uh in his uh this is in from his his commentary on the erraticon which is like for people it's like the priest book uh from the Seminoles Petro Monastery on Mount ethos um he says that um uh he talks about how the Orthodox tradition we have two different words for time we have Chronos you know once chronology right this is what father Alexander schmerman Called Death in other words it's the it's experience of time and Decay right the linear passage of moments and then we have Kairos and Kairos is this uh uh this this it's the Eternal moment right yeah it's qualified it's qualified time it's like yes qualified time is it good yeah so uh uh Charles Taylor in a secular age he describes chironic time as uh how something that happened 2000 years ago can become closer to you than something that happened yesterday so like if you go to Orthodox posca right which even if you're not Orthodox like it's not even close to your Easter this year so like you have no excuse go go find an Orthodox Church like go find out what that's like um when you go to Orthodox posca you are experiencing the resurrection as an event that is closer to you today than the moon landing or the assassination of JFK or um said you know the the you know you know the the 2016 election or something like that I don't know why I couldn't pick a non-controversial historical event but I just just file them up there my mind wouldn't do it um okay so um chronological time is the time of this world right but the chirotic time the the Kairos this is this is a time that knows no chronology um a uh uh and what uh and but we have the same thing actually with space as well which I think is not as well known in the Orthodox tradition we have two words for space there is Cora which means like normal space like any any old space and then topos right which means like a particular place yeah like that's qualified space too it's like it's like that it's like this this yeah there's a hierarchy too it's to its existence so in the liturgy Chronos becomes Kairos and space becomes place right and all of these things are kind of caught up into that Eternal moment um and to give like an example of this so this is all by by way of saying not only is the metric system demonic uh but cause and effect is made up um in the Middle Ages people did not see history and again you could read some of vodolaskin's uh essays about this and he's even got a whole section on it in a history of the island if people are curious about this but in the Middle Ages people didn't see history as a a series of cause and effects causes and effects they saw history as a battle between good and evil which means that the most important thing that history has already happened because that was the crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ yeah right but history is this battle between good and evil this is what the whole Apocalypse of Saint John is about is history seen as this conflict between good and evil in which good ultimately triumphs but because we see history in this way um if we uh you know if if I slap Jonathan or let's say I insult Jonathan I say something really mean about your mother right and then you slap me right we could say well there's a cause which is I said something insulting and in fact which is you slap me but in the Middle Ages they wouldn't have understood it this way they would have understood it as I sinned against the image of God in you or your mother and that God through your hand punished me right that's the that's the sort of difference there's a we see sort of histories being this flat two-dimensional thing but they they would have seen God is constantly always intervening in history and where this becomes really important is when you understand something like the enunciation so if you only have this Chrono this understanding of chronological time in which everything must proceed through a course a series of ordinary cause and effects or something Lewis really struggled with when he was writing Miracles and he actually kind of had to go back and revise quite a bit of it after um after a conversation with a Roman Catholic philosopher on the subject okay but um if you see history as just being the series of sort of normal causes and effects then Mary is an ordinary Jewish girl one whose life must have gone on in the usual way marriage childbirth Family Life old age death as part of a part of a normal succession of cause and effect and so you'll have conversations with somebody who talking about something like the entrance of the theotogo from the temple which is an event that we celebrate in you know that most traditional all traditional Christians celebrate and most Christians around the world celebrate um as a feast in the church but then you'll have a modern person come along and say well that's not they never let women into the temple so that couldn't have happened well listen brother nobody's saying that this is a normal thing that happened it's not the point that's why it's a miracle that's why it's very special that we're talking about it right and so it but if you see time is only in this way then the enunciation and the Incarnation become like a blip or an interruption into the ordinary passage of things which is otherwise just part of the linear progress of humanity but if you view it as uh as happening in a chirotic time it's happening in Kairos then all of the righteous actually from across human history Adam Seth Noah Abraham David right sort of narrow into a point so that by the time that uh the word is incarnated in the womb of the most holy virgin um there's basically just the one righteous family left in Israel right and but it's all from a Kronos standpoint that's terrible because look you know by a number standpoint bad guys are winning right but actually from in terms of Kairos no it's everything is distilling everything's condensing down to a single point so that all of God's interventions on behalf of his people throughout history are actually rolled up into and made manifest in that moment and this is why the uh The Magnificat which is one of the oldest Christian hymns a lot of historians think that it was already being sung in church before the old before The Gospel According to Saint Luke was actually written right it's one of the oldest Christian hymns this is why The Magnificat if you look at it it's really like a bringing together of every song of a Victorious righteous woman from the Old Testament so you can look at uh Deborah's song and Miriam's song of the Sea and the song of the righteous Hannah and like like all of their prayers right uh you know as the as the weaker person praying for deliverance right all of that stuff is kind of rolled up into that single prayer that that she prays um and so this is where we get to this idea that I think would be like the fifth and final or the the fourth and final maybe go ahead just tell people see what what Richard is is alluding to is in some ways there's a man in which you can understand the let's say the the enunciation of Mary as the cause of all the other ones that came before in in in in in a sense of meaning right it's like that's what that's what Richard is trying to allude to and that's why when we talk about it's like that which makes all those other things worthy of interest and important to notice and strings them together and makes them something is is is actually something that happens after the event and that is you know and and that's why in some ways like Christians have an eschatological vision of reality yeah which is also that that which will happen in the future like the the the ascaton that's coming over the hill that never quite happens is going to make sense of everything and will show us and will reveal to us what the cause of everything was in the first place and there's a collapse between the end and the beginning when some ways the end becomes the beginning or the beginning and the end are brought into the person of Christ as this glorious figure that is both the one that comes at the end but then revealed to be the one that created is the Lamb of God that was sacrificed before the foundation of the world although that happened at the crucifixion that might sound like a weird a weird way of thinking but it it actually is something that we experience all all the time that we experience in our lives all the time which is that the fact that we remember things in our past as being important is usually based on things that are happening to you now and that things that are culminating for you now it's like oh the reason why I liked to I like to to to play this game when I was young is because oh it turns out I'm going to become a doctor or whatever and we kind of and it's weird because the post-moderns it's something that they understood he wrote this little book called postmodernism explained to children and that was his definition of postmodernism post-modernism was basically reinterpretation of the past based on the present but again what the postmoderns got wrong is that they saw it as an arbitrary exercise in power ultimately which is that there's a way in which power can now reinterpret the past and make it align with with with their present vision and they didn't have a sense in which none of this is actually arbitrary and ultimately all of this is is playing in in Cosmic patterns that are that are true that are just simply true and are playing out in in in creation you could say that post-modernism is sort of a failure of eschatology right you don't have the capacity for an eschatological Vision you just you sort of like you're reacting against the separation of space and time but you still you still accept the the the the Chronos the the fact that things are just going to keep going right yeah well had this idea he called it open eschatology and it's an interesting idea because he understood in some ways that the future is coming to towards us and interpreting the past but he didn't want like he he he was like no it's not about saying come Lord Jesus he would just say come like just basically you know the the this this desire to see the future roll on us but you know it's like that the world actually does go through does actually does actually manifest in patterns and I'm sorry to tell you and so so it's not it's not arbitrary at all what's coming over the hill yes yes so this this kind of brings us to like the final thing that I want to say which is that the goal of this kind of reading and the goal of again my whole goal I mean it's really it was like when we sat down and we first started talking about doing the universal history series it was kind of like how do we get people to take this stuff seriously right um it's this this idea that that um uh to through these stories and through sort of helping people understand these patterns through stories right to help them have a relationship with the cosmos that is you could say like a mystogogical vision of the cosmos right the Mystic being the relationship between you could say the Earthly Temple and the Heavenly Temple right and and actually in Judaism and in traditional Christianity those are actually the same thing there's no distinction between them um and so this this uh this is a vision of a cosmos in which we see that the relationship between the scene and the Unseen is is real it's not just merely symbolic it is symbolic but it's not merely symbolic in the way that you know in a way that makes it arbitrary right yeah and that's the next thing is just it's not arbitrary you can't say this enough right the patterns by which the example you've used sometimes right is that the patterns by which the cosmos is laid out aren't just things that we are making up any more than we see an arbitrary of a arrangement of pigments on a canvas and we describe we decide that they're a van Gogh painting right um uh but it's also apocalyptic um and this is what I think sometimes people miss a little bit um uh in some of the conversations that I've seen you know happening in various circles around the internet talking about some of the stuff uh that it's apocalyptic in the original sense you know of lifting up the veil lifting the lifting of a veil right that the nature of this relationship is constantly revealing itself in man who is a microcosm of the universe and then also first and foremost in the Liturgy right so and that's the final thing is that this this relationship between the scene and the Unseen is liturgical that the relationships between these things aren't static they move they dance as in the Liturgy um and I still remember the first time I ever went to a Divine Liturgy and uh uh you know I I done my homework I'd read on things ahead of time because that's how I am and then I got there and despite the fact that I had read you know description after description of what was going to happen in The Divine Liturgy and I'm there and it's like this big Festa liturgy and there's a bunch of clergy and the coming in at the altar and they're going out of the Altar and they're doing I'm like I have no idea what is happening but I had this deep conviction in that moment that this is the shape of everything right and then of course for us ultimately the revelation of Jesus Christ the God man who is himself the total revelation of God and the total revelation of the human person and uh and that's the last thing the last point is if you're gonna understand the scripture is if you're gonna understand the Liturgy if you're gonna understand any work of pre-modern literature you have to see man as a microcosm that is as a little Cosmos right that this vision of the world is not anthropocentric man at the center but it is anthropocosmic um we are not just a collection of cells any more than a temple is a collection of bricks or the Liturgy is just a collection of arbitrary historical movements that are created over time um and this is Again by the way like there are certain certain like let's say Circles of conservatism that are currently trying to wage war against The Madness of our of our current age by reducing things so I saw uh this headline a few weeks ago um in in like a conservative website about about some transgendered person right and so to say but and and they said but every DNA of this person's you know biology is is male you know and uh but listen folks if we are reducing identity down to Cellular level down to DNA yeah right we've actually already seeded the ground to materialism yeah right because that's why C.S Lewis says it it has this wonderful quote and uh I think it I forget in which book of the the Don Shredder no I'm talking about in the space Trilogy he says he says gender is more primarily than sex and it's like and I quote it on Twitter and everybody was I saw somebody was enraged you were like losing the money thinking that I'm like agreeing with gender Theory because they want to collapse gender and sex together which is actually not a traditional thing at all gender and sex in traditional uh cultures has always been different but the problems that they're not free-floating right right they are coherent and they are they they play different they play the pattern of the same thing at different levels and you just if we it's hard for people to think that way but that's just how it is boats are female yeah boats are feminine there's nothing you can do about it um yeah um another score I thought the three this is we're gonna go but to paraphrase something he says in the voice of on Shredder if you're talking about DNA that's not what a man is it's only what he's made of right yeah uh so Archbishop Dimitri who's uh our our beloved uh uh uh founder of our diocese here in the OC the Diocese of the South he said uh that you know during the first Millennium since Christ the church was occupied with the question who is Christ they're the second with what is the church is when you have the Schism the great system the reformation and so on and that the great question of the third millennium is going to be what is man right but Archbishop Dimitri said that Jesus Christ is the answer right he says that Jesus Christ is the truth about God and the truth about man since he is both God and man God's real nature is completely revealed in the Son of God the Incarnate Word and the whole truth about man his worth his value and dignity are realized and made manifest to man in the son of man Jesus of Nazareth so this is the the first thing that we have to really understand and to read and understand ancient medieval literature liturgy all of our scriptures and we absolutely must understand if we are going to even start to talk about salvation and what what that means is that man is a microcosm um just a couple of quotes to finish this up saint makaris of Egypt said the heart itself is only a small vessel yet dragons are there lions are there there are poisonous beasts and all the treasures of evil there are rough and uneven roads there are precipices but there too is God and the angels life is there and the kingdom there too is light and there are the apostles and the Heavenly cities and the treasuries of Grace all things lie within that little space and this is why actually this is why uh in the Orthodox spiritual tradition we talk about going down into your heart right like turning the eye of the heart inward upon itself it's not an act of just like self-preoccupation but it's actually because the entire world is there and that's why uh that's why you could have somebody who is a Hermit who is actually upholding the whole world right because by praying and this is uh the athenite once corrected somebody uh for for saying you know Lord Jesus Christ Son of God have mercy on me and on the whole world I said don't don't pray that way just say have mercy on me The Sinner because if you do that then you're praying for the whole world right this really you can't ask God for anything more than that uh the way that Saint Maximus the Confessor phrases in this is he says that the church building uh that the temple but he means like the building the physical building is a human being and every human being is a church and then he actually says and the cosmos is a human being and every human being is the is a cosmos and the scriptures Are a Human Being right and every human being is a scripture right um and uh you know from there there's a lot that we could say about his mystogical vision uh which I think we're just like way over time so I'm not going to do that but um if you sort of like take these these five things right then you can use them to to sort of understand when you come to liturgy or when you come to an ancient text like Beowulf and we'll talk about this uh in the class when you come to uh even something like the scriptures and you come across something that's like offensive to your modern sensibilities um coming to the church and you see there's this big wall between you and the altar right why is that there like are you trying to keep me from God what's going on like I thought the curtain of the temple was was torn in too you know and and you know to that we would just say it was and and when do you show that in your liturgy because if you wait here in a minute you'll see it you know uh but uh if if you come across these if you come across something that's so offensive to Modern sensibilities like monasticism like the relationship between the the active and the contemplative life um you know why can't you know I'm a visitor to your church why wouldn't you let me back in the altar area you know things like that and these are all real questions by the way that that I've I've tried to answer and had to answer for catech humans and inquirers in my own Parish right but if we can understand uh if we can understand that the world is laid out in this way we can understand the human body that's first and foremost a temple of the Holy Spirit right um if that's our beginning point then uh we can go from there to address not just uh be the good kind of Taurus but also as Christians address the passions and the pathologies of our day so this is kind of my my elevator pitch my really really long elevator ride pitch for uh if you can kind of shift the way that you're thinking about these different things then okay you won't I can't make you into like a native of the Middle Ages although maybe it's more possible than some people think but uh I can't I can't I can't make you into a native of the Middle Ages but what you could do is to become the good kind of tourist who when you come to these things and when you come to these Services right and I'm really big about don't just read about this stuff you got to go to church guys um when you come when you encounter these things instead of this big weird or foreign or Eastern you can start to see actually what's going on there underneath the surface so anyway I'm gonna stop repeating myself now all right Richard thanks this is great uh and people yeah go sign up for the for for bail if I really can't wait it's going to be it's going to be a lot of fun and we're also we're going to figure out a way for people to be able to ask questions to participate where yeah moderated interactive discussion and a bunch of really cool stuff I'm excited about it because there are things that I can say to the symbolic World crew about Beowulf that I probably couldn't say in a more academic setting you know uh people just wouldn't know how to receive it or accept it but you guys have been coming along with Jonathan on this journey for so many years and and also with me like I I we've been doing Universal history for more than two years now like that's insane so the groundwork has been you know been laid so we should be able to just kind of get right into it so I'm excited about it and I look forward to seeing everybody in September all right everybody we'll talk to you soon bye-bye
