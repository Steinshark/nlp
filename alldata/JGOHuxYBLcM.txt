hey everyone so I was looking today on YouTube and I noticed that I just passed 10,000 subscribers and I want to say thank you to everyone there usually when you hear youtubers make a thank you video for this you know when they reach a subscriber milestone you hear them say things like you know I can't believe it I you know never thought this would happen I seriously can't believe it though like I I mean a few weeks ago I had 500 subscribers I was just punching posting punch out videos you know me being the game as fast as I could or whatever getting fast times on fighters and in the past like three weeks I have gained 10,000 subscribers off of pretty much just three videos and I genuinely am like in shock from it I did not expect anything near this anything of this magnitude to happen from it and I am I'm really thankful for everyone who subscribed and he's been watching my videos I really do appreciate it and uh there's gonna be more on the way and they keep making them I enjoy making them I don't have as much time as I'd like to to make these videos but I'm gonna keep working on them as much as I can you're probably not going to see them come out more often than every two or three weeks but I'm going to work on them I I read most of the comments of the videos so I see what type of games you guys are looking for what type of you know improvements I can make what things you think I'm doing well I read that stuff and I appreciate it and I keep it in mind I know you guys want me to get a new microphone because the one I'm using it's just for my phone and it's not very good but I'm gonna order one in a few days I found one that I think would be good I'm going to get a pop filter as well and hopefully it'll turn out pretty good but so yeah there's going to be a more videos on the way to just take a little while to make but um yeah thanks again everyone I it's here it genuinely is unbelievable really grateful this has happened and how my channel keeps growing like this that would be amazing thanks everyone
