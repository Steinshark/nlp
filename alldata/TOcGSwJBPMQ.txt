- We spent 24 hours in the middle of the desert next to Area 51. The most secretive government
facility in the country. Because we wanted to scope things out before the massive raid on September 20th. But things didn't go so smooth. So we're trying to spend
24 hours in Area 51 and there's a sniper in
a truck looking at us. - Where's he at, buddy? Where you at, buddy? - Don't wanna do that. - I found him! - So as we stated, this
entrance into Area 51 has a creepy white truck
with a sniper and no gate which isn't very appealing, so we're gonna try to go to a different side of Area 51 and hopefully there's not a sniper. That line over there is the
line we're not allowed to cross. I have an alien here. He said his brothers were in there, but screw your brothers. - Come on buddy, let's go. - Okay, you have fun, Chandler. - We'll see you in six
months and $1,000 later. - Take him! - This dirt road right here actually leads to the back gate of Area 51. So we're gonna give this road a try. It literally goes on forever. How much gas do we have, Connor? - Half a tank. - Don't let us get stranded. Unless we find a UFO. Then it's okay. - Guys, we have an alien deer. - So we're on the border of Area 51 and we can't tell if that's an antelope or an alien that escaped. - It literally looked like an alien. - It is an alien. - He's looking right at us. - Wolowolo! Come here, my brethren! We'll take you back to Mars! - Dude, look at those
surveillance things up there. - Those are turrets. - You guys ready? - Those are turrets. - Oh boy. - Big Red's leading the way. - We're literally within
100 feet of Area 51. And we see an alien already. Can we go up here? I wanna see my alien friend. - He's climbing on top of the RV! Look at Chris. Chris is like I wanna go! - You can see the alien
butt slowly wandering. That is Area 51. - There's literally a giant
artillery cannon over there that could destroy a freakin' planet. - Why don't you stay up
there with the binoculars? - That would be suspicious as hell. - That would be quite suspicious. - I think we're past that. - So this is the back entrance of Area 51. - We're really out here. - I mean no harm. - We're friendly. - We just came to see our brethren. - Can we talk about that gate real quick? Look at that. - Do not go into Area 51. Don't get near Area 51. We're trained professionals. - In alien cytology. - I watch The History Channel. - It turned. - What turned?
- What did? - The camera turned towards me as I was walking by it. - Oh, did it?
- Wait, what? - Yeah. - So Chris is walking to the right. Let's see if it turns. - It just did. - Bro, they're just staying on me. They don't even care for Chris. - Remember, the government
does not want to kill us. - Why?
- Maybe. - That was the most nervous
laugh I have ever heard. - So that's Area 51. That mountain right there is
where all the Naruto runners are gonna get together and storm it. - We are where the Kyles are. The Kyles are gonna berserk
right through the middle. - Yes, the Kyles are sacrifices. - I'm with the crackheads. - I don't think you can say crackheads. - Yeah, but the crackheads are over there. - The horses are always in the back. - That's where I need to be. - So the Kyles proceed from here, the crackheads over there,
and then we hit them with the side assault
from the Naruto runners. - Did you bring your bed? So that way you can put your bed down and respawn right near here. - That's why we got an RV, man. - Oh that's right, it's
got all the beds in it. - If anything happens guys, make sure you sleep in the bed so you respawn there. - All right, I'm gonna
go for my first life. - If you're gonna camp,
you gotta set up a camp. So let's set up a camp. - Hey Area 51, y'all mind
if we camp out over here? - I didn't hear a no, let's do it! Look over there if we can't camp. - Don't point, Jake. Put your hand down. - No fast movements, no pointing- - Chandler stop moving! They might interpret that as assault. - Take your hands out of your pockets! - They might think he's- - Put your hands in the air! We have exactly 30 days
until the Naruto runners, all 1.7 million arrive. And yet I don't see a single soul here. - They're not prepared like us. - I know, we're practicing for the siege. - Yeah, they'd only be
worried if we were Kyles. Since we're Naruto runners
they're not worried. - Chandler. Don't go in. - Are there landmines here? - Wait, guys guys, wait, what is that? Is that... - Wait, who's that? - Wait. Oh boy. - Uh-oh. - Oh boy. Chandler this is not
the time to be texting! Someone's coming for us. - Hey. - What's going on, man? - Just checking out places. - You guys work for the government or are you just checking it out? - We're looking for that black mailbox. - Are you guys gonna be Naruto running? - Well that's the plan. - So you're just scouting out. That's why we're here. We're scouting it out. - Yeah. - I'm not included here! I'm supposed to be sitting
in my house in Vegas! They just dragged me all the way here! - Since you're up to date on the memes, do you think it's a good idea
to have the Naruto runners come from the right
side and the left side? Or should they all just
come down the middle? - I don't know, let's check it out. - This is the one. If you go past that stop
sign a bunch of armored cars are gonna eventually meet you. I mean give it a shot
if you don't believe us. Just run real fast. - Come on, man! - I'm the Guinea pig now? - Dip in, dip out. Real quick, five seconds. - Guys, we don't have the 1.7 million Naruto runners yet. - We can do it Just us. - We saw a rainbow and we found an alien on its escape. - It was a double rainbow. - It was huge, dude. - It was giant, dude. This would be a good spot to camp out. - Right here? - Yeah. - No, our friends left us! - Can I keep this? - They didn't even say bye! What the hell, girl that
I didn't learn name of. - Can I keep this? - I have a number behind my back. It's between one and two. What is it? - It was two. - You can keep it. - Sweet! - Oh yeah, this is a UFO part, guys! Let's examine it. - Do you think it's part of a UFO? - Well what else would it be a part of? Anything else? No. - Well, we can't identify it. And if you throw it in
the air it definitely will be an unidentified flying object. - So let's test it. Let's test it. You see that? It was on his face. - Did it hit you in the face buddy? - Yeah, and I'm probably
gonna need a tetanus shot now. Can we book me a tetanus shot? - Chandler I hear they have Band-aids. Go knock on the door. - Okay. - Maybe that's why nobody's ever got in. They've never asked politely. - Yeah, they just run in. Maybe the secret to getting in
Area 51 is knocking politely. - Chandler, just go
knock on that stop sign. You won't - That's what I'm about to do. You just told me to. - You won't. - I gotta ask for Band-aids. Oh, it says one year of jail. - The Lord of the Rings
eye is staring at you. - Literally directly at you. - I see you. - Chandler stop Fortnite
dancing on the government! The all seeing eye is now pointed at me. Right in the government's face. Take that, Trump. - We setting up the tents or what? - Yeah, let's do it, boys. - Oh, there's a car. - Oh it's booking too, and it's got LEDs. - It's got bright LEDs. - Oh my gosh. - Oh gosh, oh gosh. - There's another car coming. - I just got really cold. - Everybody act natural. - Everyone don't panic! - Don't yell. - Why would you yell? Oh it's a Jeep. - I came inside to hide. Did you come here just for this? - Yeah. - I mean he's got a
pretty awesome vehicle. I feel like this and our red Jeep, we could just storm there right now. - Let us know if you
get any more information we can use to help spread to
the fellow Naruto runners. - Okay. I've been practicing with my arms back. It's harder than it looks. - You get used to it. You get your center of gravity right and then you can go as
fast as the bullets. We're gonna camp out, so. - Oh. Thank you! - Now we can see really well. Thank you, government. - I'd like to see something. - You might be seeing
something any second now. - All right, can we leave? That's not a good sound. - Oh no. Is that it up there? Or is that a star? That blinking light. - That's actually creepy. - All right, let's camp! This is perfect! This is perfect. They turned on lights for us. This is YouTube friendly. - They turned on lights and they sent a harrier just to come say hi. - Oh look! - A rabbit! Jake go catch it! That might be an escaped alien. Bunny no! Bunny! - Is he going in there? - He's right there.
- There's a car. - There is a car. - Oh there's sirens too. - No, the rabbit's about to cross! Rabbit! Rabbit. Rabbit if you go any further you will spend a year in jail. - You have so much to live for! - Dude he's literally sitting under it! - September 20th man, hold off! - Hold off for the reinforcements, rabbit! - Oh he's going in. - He's going in. - Well if he's okay. - What is that flashing alarm over there? There's cars and everything
moving towards it. - Wow. Did you guys hear that? There's a surveillance frog out here. - Can you let me in so I can call my mom? Tell her I made it alive? ♪ Whoa ♪ - And he hit the whoa. Hit the whoa in front of Area 51. ♪ Whoa ♪ - Quit dancing on the gov. - You guys seeing stuff? Oh wow, dude, you can actually see see. That thing's impressive. - What? Whoa! How? How is this so clear? - Dude, in five years they're gonna sell tickets to go look at this crap. - Imagine in 3,000 years where this is declassified and it just. - That scared the out of me, bro. That scared the out of me. - Someone turn on some car lights. - There's gotta be a reason
why they turned them off right? - I bet they saw the scope and turned off the lights. - Oh they probably saw the scope. - Dude, if I brought my big truck out here should I go get it? It lights everything up. I think that it'd make them worry. It looks like a SWAT truck. - Yeah, go get it. We'll be waiting here. So we called a high council
meeting in the RV real quick. This guy may or may not want to rob us. - Yes. - You invited him. - I did. That was a lapse in judgment. I'm sorry. Can't take that back now. We just gotta do it. - We need to make the decision, boys. Do we stay here and potentially all get... - Ix-Nayed? - Chandler, you make the decision. Chandler, our lives are in your hands. We could go to a nearby mountain. There's one right there. We have a telescope. We can climb the mountain
and see if we can telescope in if that's what you want. - That's not what I want. I wanna see some cars pull up and be like yo, what the are you doing here. I'm gonna be like- - Chandler has spoken, we're staying! - Right there is Area 51 as you can... Chandler don't point the light at it. Right here is our tents. We're gonna spend the night
right outside of Area 51. We're gonna see if they're
sneaking in aliens in and out. We're gonna keep you guys updated. - Ahh, I'm an alien! - I'm not. Maybe. - We've brought over a dozen people. They're gonna be... Did you hear a noise over there? - Who's there? - You guys know where I
can get to the mothership? - It's that way, right there. 10 more steps. - Thanks, man. - Who was that guy? - Anyways, we'll let you guys
know if we see any aliens. We're gonna be here. We got people patrolling. We're good. - All right guys, it's
nighttime at Area 51. We're camped out here. This is my last message to my family. If I don't make it back I love you. And. Bye. - All right guys, I'm heading to bed. Hopefully an alien doesn't eat me tonight. - You said an alien? - That's just Chris with fruit fly eyes. - Bzzz! Me and my girl Alienetta,
we're about to go to bed. Really tired, hopefully nobody comes and tries and takes her. There were no cat girls, but I did find me an alien girlfriend, so peace. - Hey guys, I switched shirts. You should go buy it. Buy it! But anyways, it's 4:30 in the morning and there's actually
a mountain over there. And we wanna go climb that mountain so we can see what's inside of Area 51. The only thing is this mountain
takes forever to climb. So we gotta get up
really early, it's 4:30, and go climb it now so we have enough time to do it within the 24 hours. Chandler, it's 4:30. Let's go climb the mountain. - Where are we? - Area 51. - Oh yeah. Okay, let's do it. - So they turned the lights back on. And they're way brighter now. All right, let's go say goodbye. - Oh my God, there's
broccoli on the ground. Someone was here. - So as you can see it's
4:41 in the morning. Right over there is the mountain. We're gonna go try to climb the mountain. We have a telescope and we're gonna see if we can see inside. We're gonna go do that. - Okay. - To the mountain. So you see those mountains
all the way over there? - Yeah? - We're gonna go climb them. We have a telescope and we're gonna see if we can see inside of Area 51. We literally rented an off-roading Jeep so we could use it to
climb up that mountain. So this should be a success. - What a great way to spend your money. Just on a Jeep to spy on Area 51. - We're continuing our journey. - Ow! I hit a tree. - Chandler almost lost his head. - Oof! - Sorry, GoPro! - That's what we're climbing. 'Cause if we get up
there with the telescope we can look into Area 51 over there. Your calves may hurt. You wanna know what hurts more? Not knowing about the existence of aliens! - I'll just believe whatever
the government tells me. My legs hurt. - No! We will see the UFOs. - How do I get roped into these things? - Chandler, we will find this UFO. Let's go. - Why couldn't we be makeup YouTubers? James Charles doesn't have to do this. - There are YouTubers
that do this in Minecraft that make more money than we do. - Can we climb this
mountain in creative mode? Oh this is sheer. This is sheer. - Oh. Oh Lord! - Oh my goodness gracious! - Do you wanna just
become Fortnite YouTubers? - Dude, let's just do it. Look, I'm flossing. - Beautiful. - Where is Area 51? - When we get to the top it'd be that way. - That way? - Oh! Just saw it out of the corner of my eye. I thought it was a snake. You gotta get Madame
Zeroni up the mountain! - That's a Holes reference! - Are you a minoy, Chris? - I am very much. - Think of all the- - Gosh darn. - Memes that'll be created
when you discover aliens! - Yo, there's a burger up here! It's wrapped in tin foil. It's still good. - Whoa. Look at that. - We can see for literal miles. - They're really good at keeping the aliens from us. - As you guys can see,
they have a watch tower over there with cameras on
it keeping an eye on us. They know we're spying. Means we're in the right spot, boys. - You actually see something? - Oh my God! - You see it? - We found it! Isn't it crazy that all that empty space and all these mountains are here just to shield that one little base? What? What is there? September 20th we get our answers, boys. And there you have it, guys. That's enough spying on Area 51 for today. I hope you enjoyed and
remember, September 20th. ♪ Mr. Beast 6,000, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast 6,000, oh ♪ ♪ Mr. Beast 6,000, yeah ♪
