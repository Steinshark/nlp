what could you possibly upgrade for the kind of person who already has one of these one of these a setup like this and even blows money is this a BMW wheel for your racing Sim yeah that was almost certainly taken from work I have no idea what you're talking about it's time for Jake's Intel extreme Tech upgrade and well it looks like you came up with some stuff man you have expensive taste what do you mean what do you mean what do I mean I bought things used how much was this the fanatec club sport shifter SQ it's probably like 300 U.S [Music] doesn't even go in a real car we're gonna have some fun [Music] you're not my real dad what's wrong with this one I don't I don't know if I really have an answer it's fine I think the answer is Intel sponsored this video and gave him a five thousand dollar budget and that one caught his fancy here's your steering wheel back what are we doing here well I spent a lot of my money on audio oh yeah I see that one of those things downstairs why don't we carry that upstairs first oh good let's play my favorite game stolen whoa whoa whoa whoa hey I get to recant rebuttal point to something from the office here huh I like this game I bought that from Luke so maybe it is from the office no it's not this is almost no I actually bought one I swear to God I bought one I will show you the receipt okay nothing so far I mean other than what I found already what did you find already the giant one terabyte thumb drive I brought that just for this video there's no way you bought those cable ties which one oh yeah definitely not well don't go down there this way I thought we're getting a subwoofer oh yeah yeah okay don't go down there who's there my house down here is the litter box what am I even looking at here it's a little robot it just spins wait what and then there's a sieve there you see yeah so the litter goes into the sea and then the poop stays on the other side and then it dumps it into the bottom what's one of these worth it's like 700 bucks what a 700 motion sensor and motor yeah I think it's patented he's like what the hell is going on with my poop yeah don't look at the auto feeder either don't look at that let's go back upstairs I think it was only like 100 bucks to be fair there was a reason for that well yeah your cat was fat yeah that wasn't the reason but that's a whole that's the reason well he's lighter now pick him up oh I don't know if I would describe him as thin I think he's still a pretty thick boy does he get held on his back do you guys do that that's a big fan I don't know I don't think he knows you that well yet oh my God so this is the same is this for your computer yeah why why yes what he said neighbors are gonna hate you no my office is like on the side that there's nobody oh oh buddy thought of that I like the way the other sub is not I'd be pretty stoked if you did the computer I like doing computer look at it it's so clean wear it oh my you oh you you I thought that was Gray oh do you see how much came off when I pulled this off uh yeah I did yeah I did okay I swear I vacuum it regularly I swear you're full of look at the art isn't that pretty this is pretty my friend Douglas drew that really shout out the architect's garage this is Jake's car you can't drive that it's a painting [Applause] dimensional car just fine David yes exactly hey actually speaking of which one of these Predators is definitely from work yeah I bought it from work actually both of them are from work that is literally what they all say all right I'm gonna build a computer I think you should do it downstairs or build a computer right here because I gotta do stuff in here you got to do stuff what are you doing well we gotta hang up the speakers I paid 200 bucks for them on Craigslist I think they usually sell for like 600 so I was pretty stoked about that used speakers is easy way to go used audio everything just by used headphones I can understand oh my God you're wrapped around the 2 000 headphones oh God how did that even happen what oh oh my God that's under a lot of tension actually got it leave your brother alone did I tell you you have to water cool it I noticed and changed the motherboard and CPU and RAM okay this thing runs at like 90 degrees yeah sometimes I restart my computer and it says like CPU overheat warning this is not going to improve the situation but this is but that will okay Jake's upgrade is actually pretty straightforward then he's already got an RTX 3080 so we're not going to be changing out his GPU yeah already got a great power supply good quality Case that just needs a little cleaning so we're going platform upgrade from this 5900x we're going to a 13900k arguably the fastest gaming CPU on the planet 32 gigs of ddr5 memory and wow I'm sorry did you just buy a motherboard that costs as much as your last CPU memory combo I think it costs more than the new CPU even to be fair I asked for like a z790e or F and then they sent this so thanks Jesus for the free upgrade and Intel for the free upgrade yeah does that count against your budget how does that work I'm not asking questions I think I will make your life a bit easier you can use the first time for everything yay it's I feel like it's usually the other way around anyways you can use the stock fans that are in here um you think the EK ones are better I have to have a look at them you know what's really funny is I saw I forget who it was but someone just announced a fan and they're like yeah it's really optimized for pressure on radiators because there's no random gaps around the frame so it like really pushes all the thing through and it brought me back to I swear to you like 10 years ago when Corsair released their first aios and their fans had these gaps around the frame and I did this masking tape mod where you just like cover the gaps and it lowered temps by like a degree or two and I'm sitting here going what who is designing radiator fans that have gaps around the frames and people have still been doing it for 10 years it drives me crazy uh these do not have gaps around the frames though these look like they will actually mate properly with the radiator so I'm kind of tempted to put these in okay I mean it's your wiring nightmare I know you feel like you're helping but taking the box that contained all the water cooling parts and blowing it up all over the counter was not actually helpful that was like the goal thanks got him this is no longer secure [Laughter] and that is why oh my God an LGA socket is not a bad thing to have I mean the good news is the dust filters are clearly working look at this this thing's clean I started putting the cooler brackets on but then I remembered I have the this thing oh the contact frame contact frame I figure for 20 bucks I might as well just throw it on that's worth a couple degrees by the time you're going custom water cooling if you're not using the best thermal compound or picking up one of these contact frames which the functions right in the name it helps the cooler make better contact with the CPU you're kind of not doing it right mind you you shouldn't have to buy these no but that's dumb oh this replaces the top of the socket I don't know how much I like this contact frame and that you have to take all this off but don't over tighten it when you put it back on this is a really really sensitive operation you do not want to drop a screw or anything like that it's just land grid array you know what I should do is yeah put the CPU in there so you have to be able to hold it down while also screwing it in and as soon as you put down the one side it kind of Springs up the other side this very much voids the warranty on your motherboard and CPU if you tell them you used it though just so you know there we go for you Jake I'm about to mount the radiator uh yes I know I know you want it in the front but do you want the fans in front of the rad or do you want the fans behind the red I vote front it's got a fan filter okay I might need a hand getting these in here then what are you so basically I see what you're doing yeah I gotta I gotta hold the mushed so if you can grab those cables and then if we can pull this across let me tuck the cables into that cable management I just want to get this first one hold on hold on hold on hold on how you doing how you doing this is definitely not the absolute fastest Ram I could put on this board but it is 6 000 cl32 so it's pretty quick um it was the same price as CL 46000 it was on sale so it was like 230 or 240 bucks us wow so yeah goodbye want to throw me that board are you ready for that I think we should actually we should put this in first no I want to put the fans in the top and the back first no I don't want to put fans on the top why don't you want fans in the top just the back is fine what no I don't want I don't want top pants yeah know how to look they're white they're like I know but they'll be somewhere else I'd rather you put that black knock to a fan will it fit no oh damn it that's a negatory wait I have more EK fans RGB fans I have an AIO as well ah yeah sold just go grab that it's upstairs all right it's in the closet should I warm out the speakers let's go have a look at it okay so are they is it like an angled now like yeah I would probably go further over oh you want to go like to the corner yeah far they stick off the wall they're huge okay what about today's video we got six what about like just lay it sideways on the desk um I might have to bring the monitor up a bit but I am not gonna lie I hate the aesthetic of a lying flat monitor if you're into it and it kind of fits perfect and look we have this cool thing so this company is called sonar works and they make what does that look like uh I don't know like a fancy thermometer or some kind of probe oh it's a microphone yeah it's a correction microphone so usually when you have computer speakers you can't really room correct them unless you buy like a home theater receiver and use that but you don't want to home theater receiver they're huge and they use a lot of power so this company makes a piece of software you hook up this mic you measure your computer speakers and it makes a correction profile for them oh that's cool yeah and they have headphone correction profiles too all right are we gonna go are we gonna go this route then I think this is the way to go slight problem with that plan I have a new monitor for the side and it's bigger you know what though I already volunteered for downstairs work on the computer Duty so that sounds like a you problem we moved the computer so now there's so much dust in the room oh hold on hold on you're not allowed to go in there I'm not allowed in there because this is where you keep all the big stuff you took from the office you said I could borrow that yeah I said you could borrow it that was like two years ago and look you have one at your house too I steal more from the office than anyone yes oh my God it's you it's a thick boy it's gonna do many Wubs though it's nothing like a 12 inch high Excursion driver as a foot rest it's ergonomic on the one hand okay you can count on Jake to put like tons of research into everything he buys but on the other hand it's like individual Research into that individual item the amount of thought into how it all goes together tends to be a little all right this monitor is pretty sick it's uh it's DVI but it does work I have DVI to DisplayPort I think by sick you mean ill yeah oh this is stolen from the office what actually no this isn't no it's not nope this nhd9l it's almost certainly stolen from the office though oh yeah 100 there's the asset tag this is definitely stolen from the office yeah I no longer care because I don't want these things to appear on camera you told me to take that one home and a second I fixed it kit that one is probably from the office well I don't think you're the worst you missed the nas in the garage oh my God it's the garage heater no I do not like to be licked by dogs like go no go place go oh don't get the camera lens he's like why do I always end up under people's desks I couldn't help noticing that you could use some of our upcoming magnetic Cable Management yeah keyword upcoming this monitor is a bit Overkill as a side monitor hello Ripley it's 165 Hertz IPS I think it's displayed cr400 yeah it totally is and this is my side monitor what this is for twitch chat but they have gotten so cheap this is like a 400 monitor Canadian yeah on sale so it's like 300 real dollars yeah hey can you can you help what oh well I am helping I'm jamming your sub under the tabs okay oh mint I like these mounts a lot I think it's gonna have to go up a bit yeah I don't know if the other one can even so it's not enough it's like all the way up and it's still not it's good enough for the video why did you pee in the house no Jake's dog that's bad and so I'm on my own in here right now this surround sound setup has got to be for the Sim chair you're gonna have two giant subwoofers in this room Jake what the hell man you're not my real dad I didn't know Logitech even still makes these 5.1 kids guess how much I paid for this it's used but brand new it was 100 bucks what yeah I think it's usually four or five hundred yeah I mean they're not amazing they're not gonna sound anywhere as good as those calf speakers but they're also pretty good especially for racing yeah if what you want is directional audio Yeah hey look in this box you're never gonna guess where all these cables are from wow it's from infinite cables yeah infinite cable what a surprise Jake Never chills for infinite cables look they make great products okay but this is pretty cool active Optical DisplayPort to run to this monitor I was using a long normal cable yeah and it was not flaky no it was it couldn't you couldn't run the full res couldn't help noticing that this is a really long cable to go from there to there yeah I was just trying to Future proof the thing about optical cables is that most of the cost is in the transceivers yeah this is cheap this is expensive so the cost difference between a hundred foot one and a 25 foot one is actually pretty close like 20 bucks yeah this is uh 50 foot and the 25 I think was ten dollars less I'm sorry Jake uh you gave me two rcas do you want the red one or the white one to plug in the sub both of them you're not using the LFE or using that's right I always see that on subwoofers I'm like who would plug this into a subwoofer you get the sub oh it's when you have a two channel DAC that doesn't have a sub Channel so I'm using an RCA splitter one channel will go in there and the other one there and then the other cable goes to the speaker amp and this goes to the Zone it's cheaty but it should still sound fun oh God okay everything's plugged in you got to see the wiring behind here it's no it's a spicy salami I will say even with banana plugs that looks like a disaster well it's because of the the splitter right to demo this audio we need a computer oh I guess we should work on the computer then yeah Jinky I solved it I'm gonna put those behind my desk yeah I don't know what do you mean like I don't know you have surround speaker stands and you're sitting here going I don't know I'm gonna put my surround sound in oh on the racing side yeah that's actually moderately intelligent she was literally sitting on your porch yeah and the fronts are easy because I can like three different amount for the monitor this case is actually gonna be like filled up I'll have a reason to have bought the 5000. oh we need to make sure there's clearance for the GPU yeah we've definitely run into that before you want to pull that now it's gonna go super long GPU oh fudge wow damn brother wow how many how many millimeters you got there I don't know but I'm not buying a 490 that's for sure no you can't raise that bracket it needs to go here or nowhere else that's it yep perfect what even is that power cable I just have a barrel Jack just chilling here I have no oh it's for my headphone amp this is actually a new product from JDS Labs the element three boosted so it has twice the power of the previous element three it's a DAC amp combo so you plug your USB in you plug your power in and it's gonna convert the digital signals to analog signals and then amplify them so you can listen on fancy headphones that need lots of power fortunately it uses the same cables as my old amp and the same power supply so I don't have to change any of that oh look at that this thing is this is a lot nicer than what I had hold the knob David you experience the knob shift it feels pretty nice that's pretty cool yeah that's pretty neat the nice thing about this one too is I don't have to have a separate USB cable I can actually hook this right into the wheelbase which is kind of nice previously I had USB cable for this USB cable for this and USB cable for the pedal so now I'll be down to two which is nice hey the holes do line up sick wow uh can I pass this to you which one through the back no yeah I probably should and then I need it here where my finger is well it can be any one of the fans because they're just gonna all daisy chain together and go on to one of these RDP letters um so maybe this one would be wait you put goth I swear to God take them out I don't want top fans I don't know what you're talking about God damn it dude I can't take you okay let me see at least okay fine whatever I mean okay I guess it's technically a win life is all about utterly meaningless victories Jake I'm just gonna start making some executive decisions executive decisions hold on I think it's I think it's good what in the look look hold on hold on just just chill for a second the problem is we got a lot of fitting density over here so I'm kind of thinking out to here out to here over to here I'll move that to that that's exactly that's what you said okay cool yeah you're you're there you're on it he knows what he's doing I love having my ideas repeated to me I think I got a defective screw this screw just snapped off right in the thing and then another one is not going in are you silly goose are they not long enough no they're long enough I don't know what's happening here you hear the silly goose no I don't think I'm a silly goose you're a goose man I mean Goose maybe silly no I'm the serious just goose hell is going on no are you wrecking my rad it just won't go in yeah you tell them David and even that one did you try to put them one in both of these no the top one yeah the bottom one you didn't I did not crossroad that I don't get it they're just not going in Jake yeah you're right are you just going for it yeah okay hopefully it doesn't snap off again I think I have better oh okay it's in okay then as long as we can get one more in it's fine we're not shipping the thing but please don't break screw I love you here mate not gonna lie Jake I'm not super into the color of your coolant here it's a little bit pee colored oh yeah I didn't show the finished build there it is 3900k 3080 water cooling done it's not the finest water loop ever but that's all right price was right I don't really care what it looks like at all I just wanted to perform well oh yeah for sure that's uh that's why you were all upset about the non-matching fans and climbing them at the topic I don't really care how it looks like at all it just needs to be exactly the way I like it just needs to be matched because like OCD you know wait a second are we filling a water loop or are we enjoying a refreshing Capri Sun juice beverage what is this a little bit of both a fill bag hey it doesn't look that yellow [Music] wish me luck oh my God no do it from here oh come on try I don't know dude oh my God oh my God me sideways okay all right actually Fair I would like to see poor water fluid it's yellow I want to watch you pour a washer told you I'm a car guy you know of all the people I would trust to do this it's you because I always know you can buy me a new motherboard not because you think I'll pour it out look at that well this is a lot of RGB look how happy he is about the fan I've never had this much RGB in my computer before this looks amazing yeah it looks dope okay this is this is a pretty pretty good looking machine oh I like that they put a clear cap on this yeah that's although the metal fittings look a little I don't know no I like it I like it I wish they were black but that's what I mean and look it doesn't really look that P with the RGB you're right okay this still looks like pee though that looks like a pea bag I don't even know if I should point this out to you is the bottom van not spinning because now oh it's spinning that ain't the problem uh but EK misaligned the sticker oh my God that's awful that's actually really bad stupid tiny but don't worry it's okay okay because he doesn't care what the computer looks like maybe I'll get Dan to fix it why do I enjoy it so much when I know that things bother Jake oh I know because he enjoys it just as much when things bother me he's not wrong Jake your setup is ridiculous what you have an audio interface just on the floor next to your leg thing your subwoofer is sitting on a piece of particle board the cables under here are probably the worst I've ever seen what it what what's bad about them what is the problem like there's too many of them I just genuinely don't understand these were managed and Zapped zip tied like cable tied nicely and then I started taking stuff apart to remove some of the old stuff last week that's why the cables were hanging down knock knock who's there what kind of cable ties do you have for an extreme Tech upgrade extreme cable test this is not the worst thing I've ever done how bad is this gonna be uh am I gonna not like it pretty good it'll be pretty good it occurs to me that with the amount of footage we've shot today there's going to be one hell of a float plane behind the scenes with all the extra footage so go subscribe over on floatplane.com if you want basically this but a lot more of it oh yeah that's fine but we just want to try it right like yeah sure I'll 3D print something in like three years hey it works nice yes new CPU installed that's understandable okay this is uh that this is uh I mean they're on and guess what now you have to um wire them all oh my God I think it's huge I think no no don't tape that thing just leave it on top of the sub seriously do you want to get licked by a dog okay all right all right step into the Peak that explains why my stock is wet no no God damn oh my God those are so cute and they're all Catos ones okay but I got three that kind of match four as an odd number I was thinking maybe you wanted to take one these are so cute I want to keep these three I was thinking you take that one where uh where what are these from uh who does artists on society something Society6 that's that's super cute I will take you up on that hey it runs a 2.5 gigs nice 2.5 gig is such a game changer yeah I don't you don't need 10 gig no I can't say I'm a huge fan of how you have that speaker sitting there which one that one looks like almost falling off the desk which one yeah the one that's hanging off the oh oh my God oh my God what was that what are you doing I played the test tone here do it again dude I'm gonna turn it way down [Music] oh sorry David it's really balanced audio left right that's what that was left right there you wanna hear it again okay that's a that sub does Wubs I turned it down to like minus 40. what what I forgot about the sub I was I was so busy listening to the stereo speakers I was like um [Music] just give it a sec this is so dumb I know it's great right I mean you put a theater sub at your desk these have the same amp as the ones that are in your theater I know that let's try the racing Sim all right what game am I playing a set of course on so this is very Simi hey yeah oh yeah oh you're not even allowed to run over those little things well I thought that I thought this what the hell is happening here why why are there things in the middle of the road Jake what what is this you gotta enter the track sounds good eh yeah sounds great and that torque on this wheel Jake is it it must be better with more torque oh yeah is good oh oh hold on slow down slow down slow down I don't know the Trap Team got another track why do you always crash at the same spot I've never driven this in this car in this game but oh my god oh he's got it he's got it unlike most extreme Tech upgrades I can't really say that I see the difference um if anything it's kind of Messier but a lot of money was spent yeah and the experience racing Sims surround sound pretty good new shifter pretty good it may not be cable managed but my boy here doesn't seem to care much because this setup looks like an absolute blast uh you're definitely going to want to do something about oh that one's falling off uh stickers here but that sounds like a problem for another day in the meantime thank you Intel for one of the uh maybe not cleanest looking but certainly most interesting extreme Tech upgrades if you guys enjoyed this video you can go check out the playlist with the whole series that we're gonna have linked down below
