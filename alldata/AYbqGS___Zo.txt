I failed the coding interview I mean this one feels like it's very close to home and I'm very very excited about this uh by the way I work at Netflix by the way not a big deal uh not a big deal a year ago I interviewed at Netflix and absolutely embarrassed myself which obviously led to a rejection but a lot of you guys wanted to hear about that so let's talk about it now even though I didn't get the job I hope my experience can teach you guys on what not to do I learned a lot from it and I performed better on my other interviews after that and I hope it helps you guys out too so I've said this like a thousand times and I'm going to say it again don't interview at the place you want interview at a bunch of places you don't care about and then when you feel super confident on the interviewing game then go and try to interview at the places you want because now you know what you're doing right because hey you don't want to work get initech okay no one's excited about initech so you go and you go to initech and you go through their interview process and you learn how to crush an interview then after you get done with inch and you're like this is how you crush an interview then you go to Netflix how do I interview at places I don't want you start applying to places you don't care if you get the job or not it genuinely helps because there's like a whole set of jitters that you're going to get there's ways that your brain's going to just turn off the first time you stand in front of a whiteboard or you talk to somebody about one of your experiences but then you're going to learn that people just ask generally the same questions yeah there's going to be probably some tricky DSA question but hey learn your basic data structures you're going to get through most of it right uh if you don't do that it's just going to be hard right it's just going to be hard this only works if you get an interview by the way yes you have to be able to get interviews and obviously that's a bit more tricky when you're starting off you don't really get a lot of these options uh if you're just starting off and you've been going to a university go to a care career fair interview at every place oh you don't like you don't want to work at SeaTac underwater warfare in Seattle well guess what go interview there all right interview as the best as you possibly can interview because it's going to give you experience it's going to give you good experience the first thing you guys probably want to know is how did someone like you even get to interview with Netflix well the answer to that question is I don't [Music] know this is actually the truest statement of all time uh real talk why do some companies reach out what what and how does these intersections happen like I you know like honestly real talk I am of the firm belief that two days before I got a message sent out to me I changed my skills on LinkedIn and I think during this time 10 years ago skills were like a highway in which they popped up people's candidates and why I changed my skills was very very simple when I first started out on LinkedIn I thought the site was stupid so so I put cage fighting as my skill then everybody started endorsing me because it was funny after I got hundreds upon hundreds of endorsements for cage fighting I realized people are going to think I'm a cage fighter maybe I should change what my skill set is on LinkedIn therefore I went and changed it to mustache analysis and within two days I got an interview request for Netflix was it right was it wrong did it actually lead to me cuz I changed my skill set people started endorsing that I started showing up in more search results I don't know what happened I don't know the LinkedIn algorithm I don't know the LinkedIn algorithm back then but that's just what happened okay moral the story cage fighter yeah I know the fact that I changed my profile showed up that I was active I thought it was rxjs yeah at the end they said they're looking for people with rxjs skills but why did I show up on the search to begin with my guess is because I was making changes to my profile and then that's what led it down the entire Road huh huh what do you mean by that I honestly don't know how I got an interview I think it was just all luck Netflix is a big company so they probably let a lot of people interview but the way it started was like all jobs I just applied online I applied for the new grad position since I was in my last year of college at the time I didn't have a referral in my application I just filled it out and called it a day and surprisingly only one day passed and I get an email next steps with Netflix what a in surprise when I applied I did it as a joke because in my mind I was like yeah Netflix is going to interview me that's funny you got the whole Squad laughing the company that only hired senior engineers at this point is going to interview some average Bozo like me so what he doesn't realize is that Netflix has changed their mind completely on this in the last like six to eight months or a year uh two years ago we started like interviewing new grads and all that and now we actually have like a whole level system and everything now completely different than how it used to be so yeah guess what jokes on you of course they're going to interview interiew you okay got to keep up with the times you got to read those news articles you got to read those medium articles that is how trash sta got hired trash specifically got hired because they decided they're going to start letting Junior Engineers leak or leak uh [ __ ] they're going to start letting Junior Engineers work and Netflix I got to quit reading chat cuz y'all just saying crazy things that's hilarious now if you don't know how the software engineer interview process goes for a lot of companies it usually goes like this the first step is the initial application so you just send your resume blah blah blah the second step is an online assessment which is just a coding test on a platform similar to leak code we do code signal so we do code signal I kid you not okay so I had this interview gosh it was months ago and I had this interview so I was just like hey um tell tell me about yourself tell you know what have you've been working on they're like and I'm like okay very fantastic hey are you more familiar with promises or callbacks in JavaScript and they're like well I don't really do a lot of typescript I'm not super you know I'm I'm a python person and obviously red flakes right there but I was like okay so would you be probably a little bit better with callbacks and they're like absolutely and I'm like okay fantastic so what do I do I go through I redesign the experiment or like my little coding challenge to be a callback challenge as opposed to a promise challenge you know trying to be really nice to them give them the op the greatest the greatest possible chance to succeed and when I do that they're like I'm really just not all that familiar but okay here and then all I see the whole screen flash like it's been highlighted and I'm like that was strange and then I see this in the camera so I'm like what you thinking about and they're like oh you know just how to solve this problem so how do you think you should solve it oh you know this is oh I got an idea how to solve it and then all of a sudden it was like a monotonous not a monotonous it was like a a monotone typing just was like going on the screen and I'm sitting there going huh and then what gave it all away besides for the the while typing doing this right very strange thing to do while typing by the way is that during that thing sorry this is go but you'll get the idea there was a Quee and the person went like this next equals you know uh Q do shift bang that and they they're like I have no experience with typescript if you're going to bang an array operation with typescript to CSE a non-null value you cannot tell me that you don't know JavaScript okay or you don't know typescript oh I I have I had no idea right I was just like [ __ ] this is just full B this is I was already doubt I was pressing X hard but the fact that you just slapped you just slapped it in there must have been the gaming chair dude it was so much [ __ ] from then if you do good by the way I've been chat GPT like seven times y'all if you are interviewing don't use chat GPT you stupid individual okay first off you can't communicate Your solution because now you're reading code you don't understand about a problem second off it's completely disingenuine okay you're going to still have to go and interview with people you're still going to have to stand in front of a whiteboard you're probably still going to have to have some other kind of questions and you're going to utterly fail at it don't do it be smarter be smarter than that on that you move on to a phone screen and this is usually a technical coding interview where you'll solve some question with an engineer at the company and if you do good on the phone screen you'll move on to What's called the on-site interview this usually consists of you should communicate communicate the phone screen communicate communicate hate if you just start typing at a speed in which people never solve problems at which is super monot like monotonic and then on top of it you can't explain what you're doing and then when I ask you to walk me through your code you're like uh you you think I want to hire that multiple interviews and it could be one or multiple coding interviews a system design interview and then a behavioral interview and if you pass all of those you get the job pretty easy right no now some of you guys freak out and are like going to get job an internship the process seems so difficult how am I going to do this or the smart people that are like well not every company does it like this some of them have it really or the smart people that are like oh my God how am I going to get chat GPT just makes terrifying images even this thing becomes uncanny right like what is going on here this poor sloth is like a pile of just Slinky sloth right it just it's it's just it look at this poor one what happened to it it just has legs coming out of everywhere it's just legs you can't even see it there's just look at look at look at all those legs there's just legs everywhere okay it's terrifying I hate uncanny valley of all this the job or an internship the process seems so difficult how am I going to do this or the smart people that are like well not every company does it like this some of them have it really easy well you're right the interview process all depends on the company some companies have it easier some companies have it harder it really just all depends for Netflix at least for the new grad position which I applied for it went like this the first step was the application which I just did the Second Step is an online assessment the third step is a phone screen with a Netflix engineer and then the last part the weird part is the online assessment I've never done that so usually we I we've just done a phone screen that uses code signal that's like a online assessment right I I I've never this like the two-part one I don't know that that must be a newr specific one I I've never done that is the onsite and I've done a lot of nrad interviewing H okay which was three interviews a coding interview a system design interview and then a behavior interview the email I got was for the online assessment and I think it was just an automatic response to weed out applicants before they actually check resumés I had a few days to prepare before it expired so I spent some time doing some leode questions before attempting the assessment the assessment was done on a platform called code signal and the questions were very similar to what you see on Le code the coding assessment had four questions that felt like Le code easys and mediums I only saw three of the questions a question about metries follow me up but I thought that was it because I've seen some posts online you know Reddit posts where people literally get a perfect score and get rejected so I was like well whatever wasn't expecting much anyway not a Netflix we we we technically I mean we value very high technical solving ability but we're also pretty good at recognizing that a 45-minute inter interview on doing Le code isn't necessarily the greatest indicator as to technical Acumen you know what I mean it's good place it's a it's a a good place Netflix would not want me so a few weeks passed and I was just in bed scrolling on Tik Tok you know being lazy being a degenerate and I get an email from a Netflix recruiter saying hello from Netflix next steps I cannot believe the email I was in complete shock and disbelief now at this point in my opinion I've officially moved on to the interview process because check my resume I've done the online assessment to weed out people when I passed and now you guys are probably wondering well what did your resume look like to move on well in my opinion my resume wasn't that impressive I had two small internships that weren't that impressive at least to a big company like Netflix and the personal actually it's it's it see that that first off that is very impressive to any company right you're in school you're in your final year and you've already had three-month internships for multiple times right there's a lot of stuff you learn in three months that are just super annoying right everyone's first 3 months is just a super annoying stuff you know what I mean projects I had at the time were very simple YouTube tutorial type of projects all of them were web development projects none of it was really unique I didn't stand out too much I think the projects I had were a social media clone a Blog website and then a simple crypto website where I just fetched data from an API I also didn't go to some fancy prestigious school like Harvard MIT or UCLA I went to an average State School like when I applied to jobs and I had I had I have Montana State University that's where I went a lot of Grace has griven to new new ads yeah one thing I also really enjoy is that I I am very happy that people don't uh that where you went to school is starting to matter less like honestly college and university is what you make it you can go to a a shitty school and you can have an incredible exper experience you can go to an incredible school and be a complete dumbass coming out of it how does how does someone handle moving from Cal uh to California for Netflix if you've lived on the East Coast I mean the same way you did it for me I love sour I mean you have to take I disag uh you have to be able to take risks right you have to be able to take risks uh all risks are taken it's just a part of life you have to be willing to do something that maybe is uncomfortable unusual difficult uh like I said one of the hardest decisions I've ever personally made in my life is moving to California from montania when my wife was 9 months pregnant we literally arrived there the day she could not travel any further with no doctor no friends and no house trying to work in Netflix was it easy no were we nervous yes was it difficult yes was I scared absolutely um but was I able but but did we do it yeah like you just got to you know take a risk you're not gonna like moving from the east coast to California is not a risk right it's a risk but it's not a risk you know what I mean like there's real risks you can have in your life that one's more like if you mess up and things go south you have to figure out how to get your ass back home and it kind of sucks and it it's it's totally shitty like I get that just like for me too it'd be totally shitty I'd have to go figure out all that crap with a newborn it's totally awful but it's not like all of a sudden you know it's not like I'm risking my life or anything like truly difficult it's just it is what it is you know uh second uh someone said oh I disagree some universities have better opportunity than others sure there are I I never said that there are universities better or worse I simply said universities are what you make it you get to determine how much information you want out of a university if you go to a shitty University you can still like I went to Montana State University there's nothing like prestigious people aren't writing blog posts about how incredible Montana State University is but guess what I made the most out of it I went to every career fair I learned everything about it I read every single book from front cover to back cover I absolutely was I was the kid that set the curve in every single one of my classes there was the real differences in your professors one of my professors I could not understand his Chinese accent was so thick I could not understand him even towards the end of my time at University after being there for four years I could not actually talk to him okay it was too hard like it was so difficult it was so difficult and guess what guess what I just read the book and I was his high I was his his most accomplished student by simply reading the book and just doing that you know what I mean it's just again I think that you can kind of choose your heart you can choose what you want to get out of it you get four years figure it out you know it was hard it sucked it's not like I loved it anyways had to enter my school sometimes it wouldn't show up as an option and I had to select other so yeah I have no idea how I moved on now I was at the phone screen stage where I have to do an interview with the Netflix engineer so I set up the time for the interview and started the Le code grind I was on my [ __ ] David goggin type of grinding I was eating Le code for breakfast lunch and dinner I was [ __ ] overdosing on Le code Le code was running through my veins I dreamed about Le code had nightmares about Le code it was serious you could put me on a motivational video now I'm being dramatic here but I think I did around 50 to 75 Le code problems from when I got the email to the day of the interview I should do a stream where I do leak code problems I haven't done that in a long time I think that'd be a lot of fun H you don't want me as your hero by the way I'm not a Great Hero I couldn't do much preparation because remember how I mentioned I had two small internships on my resume well I was in the middle of that second internship and I also had class and at the time I was taking computer vision and machine learning if you seen the math class so dude like when you do real machine learning classes and you're doing like particle swarm optimizations and ant colony optimizations and you're proving evolutionary algorithms and all that kind of crap and you're doing you know uh what's it called the uh the air back propagation calculations it's hard right like I had to write a bunch of neuron Nets by by hand and and I have a library up on GitHub still to this day where I I have you know and MLPs rbfs and fizzes and colonies particle swarm evolutionary stuff it was hard yeah it's not something I could just skip on I probably would have failed those classes if I didn't pay attention but fast forward to the day of the interview I was so fing nervous I didn't have much interview experience and the thought of interviewing with a company like Netflix made it aund times worse I was sweating couldn't focus it was just bad man but the interview got started the interview was done online so I was in a zoom call with an engineer and we use code signal as the platform to write my code the interview started by introducing ourselves you know ask me about my experience my projects and all that and I think I was fumbling my words a bit too since I was so nervous but after that they asked the coding question the question was something you'd expect from Le code and the most surprising thing about the question was that it was similar to one I've done on Le code so in my head I was just like thank God I won't embarrass myself at least so I started off by explaining what I thought the problem was asking the interviewer agreed and said I was on the right track cool then I started to explain my Approach for the problem and the interviewer was once again agreeing with me confir by the way this is all good approach hopefully everyone's kind of understanding which is prove that you understand the problem state how you're going to solve it don't get wax eloquent with your words and try to be a dummy about it just be quick with it you don't even need to talk about running time you don't need to talk about any of this crap just be go like this I'd do this I'd use a hashmap I'd B always just say you're going to use a hashmap or priority que okay it's always the same question priority Q hashmap every single time do that add the word sort at the end boom you've pretty much covered like 99% of all problems you're good to goir me that I was on the right track and I was treating it like a pairr session since that's what they said but I think it's [ __ ] for some companies because some of these interviews I swear they just want you to solve the problem anyways I explained my Approach and now it was time to C it up here's where the problem start and my nerves completely took over you ever had that moment in school when you're doing an exam or a quiz and once it starts you just forget literally everything you learned yeah that happened to me during this interview now so one thing I will say about this is that if you come across a problem and you feel like you really know it and then it's time to start coding and then you feel like you can't do it and it's very scary and all these kind of things it's very very simple to break this first stop trying to memorize a solution right drop everything out of your head and and then start one at a time right like you just have to do that people always forget this thing which is very very simple and I've said this to a lot of people because I've always been asked why don't you get any sort of test anxiety I I come in with a very very simple answer I already know what I know right like so when I walk into that test I've studied I know the problems that's that I'm going to be presented a problem I'm going to walk through every single thing I know one at a time when I get presented a problem oh how do you do whatever this thing should be okay first off can I put it in Array okay if I put an array and I sort it what do I get out of it okay maybe no nothing okay what about a dictionary can I count each value okay I could count each value right like you start you just have to walk through things one at a time you don't try to go to the first best of solution just walk through what you know because if you just go through what you know you're gonna get to the solution you know nothing johon snow you know nothing right and don't forget uh it's better to ask for help uh and get somewhere than just sit there blankly and say sorry I need to take a step back back let's uh let's start from the beginning exactly exactly communicate what you're doing you can even State holy cow I felt like this problem was super simple but I've just got extremely nervous and I feel like I've forgotten everything so I'm actually going to Rego through this and walk through everything that I know and we're going to go one at a time through this okay right like totally reasonable to do would you accept an N squ solution I wouldn't care if it was an N squared solution I'd want you to explain it and then I'd talk about how can we make it faster if making it faster is what I want to see right here I just want to see like me personally when I go through these kind of things I want to see that you are a basic competent coder you know what I mean I want to make sure you just know how to code that you've done it enough that you're not fumbling and goofing around that you you're like oh I how do you join a string right like if you use a language you should know how to join the string okay that's all there is to it if you don't know how to join your strings if you don't know how to split your strings if you don't know how to find something in a string if you don't know how to do your most basic problems in a language you say you're familiar with then I have high doubts about it right like really that's for me uh like it's not that bad you could do it you could do it even though I explained my Approach ask some questions I just completely forgot how to code the nerves W my solution started with a hashmap and I chose python as my language for the interview because I'm a soy Dev and I want it really easy let's go let's go oh yeah and in order to make a hashmap in Python you tend to use a dictionary or a dick the problem was I forgot how to use a DI you know a lot of men forget how to use the dick okay it it like with age as time starts going on you forget about it but don't ever forget that one simply does not measure their dick in bites okay it's just something you don't do you literally never do that and even if you do try to do that stack overflow will write you a handcrafted moderator response saying that hey sorry your question clearly has double on andras in it and you're not allowed to measure your dick and then you will never know how big your dict is okay sure you take a two-hand approach to this dict measuring well guess what you still not precise so I basically forgot how to use my dick you know it happens to every developer's life life where you just forget how to use your dick very unfortunate so I ended up stumbling on the most basic things with a dictionary and look at it from the interviewer's point of view right the person you're interviewing is someone who's done a few years of coding classes since it's a new grad position right they've passed the online assessment their resume was good enough to make it here but you're telling me they can't do a simple for Loop how the did they get here now unfortunately I spent all my time stumbling on the solution and then the interview ended just like that I just knew that was it it was just embarrassing man and the interviewer was nice and was just like it's all right man don't worry about it it happens to a lot of people and that was it the worst part about it was that literally the moment the interview ended I decided to finish implementing my solution with the same test case that I was given and I kid you not in about 5 minutes I coded it up without any issues it's like all the knowledge came seeping into my head and I was so mad now a few days passed and I was just disappointed with myself like how could I mess up the easiest interview I probably could have ever gotten for Netflix I solved a similar question my Approach was correct how can I just forget how to code but I get an email from the Netflix recruiter and the email says congratulations you're moving on to the next steps and I was so fing excited I was so happy it was crazy man I'm just kidding I just got a rejection letter obviously you thought it was going to be a happy ending I'm not the main character here I was just a side character who finally died for plot and even if I did move on I would have had to do a system design interview and if I did that interview I probably would have gotten banned from ever applying to Netflix again I never studied anything about system design so I had no idea what to do there so I probably got saved from embarrassing myself even more now while in the interview guide I got from Netflix they said they care about your problem solving but at the end of the day it's a coding test if you can't code it why should you pass now after this inter I do want to reemphasize again if you're if you say you know a language and you go in there and you can't write a for Loop because you're trying to go so damn fast as to be impressive you're going to be depressive okay remember it's not about speed calm down do the things you know you've literally written a forloop 10,000 times okay a very by the way something that's very very good to do this is probably my best piece of advice I can give you before you go into a phone coding interview turn off your LSP turn off co-pilot turn off everything and just simply start writing code and just keep on doing that for a little bit right because when you do that you're going to have some of the best like kind of experience and going oh yeah okay okay yeah and it'll just really stick into your brain and then guess what you'll come out the other side and when you go and you get into it it will be fantastic you'll do actually a really good job and you're not going to have this mess up because guess what you're going to go into an editor you've never used you're going to go use it with a color scheme you've never used you're going to have somebody talking to you asking you questions you're going to be in this completely foreign environment that you're just totally not used to so at least go and train in an environment that gives you nothing so that way when there is a little bit of intell sense you're using Code signal ah you got a little bit Intellis sense okay awesome easy I could do that right you kind of of do a little bit of those things that just makes things just a little bit you know makes a little bit you know easy uh are you saying a train at gravity 100x gravity exactly interiew even though it was a fail I definitely learned a lot I learned how to control my nerves better make sure I knew my coding fundamentals and improveed how I manage my time during the interview again interview at places like if you get an interview with a company you really like and you're super excited about it try to push out the interview a little bit and just try and try to get an interview anywhere else just go through it once you know what I mean go through it once so here's my advice for you guys so that it doesn't happen to you too don't let your nerves take over I know it's really hard but really try your best don't spend a majority of your time just talking about the solution they're here to see you code now it's perfectly fine to talk while you're coding since it helps the interviewer see your completely agree completely agree with everything that he said everything was perfect it was perfect it was perfect uh yeah I I mean the thing is it's it's these things really aren't all that hard you know what I mean like these things aren't really all that bad you got to just just take a moment like so much of it is trying not to go faster than you normally go you know what I mean oh yeah I'm G to put a like on that don't people just try to go so damn fast right they try to go so fast and be impressive just work at the level you're used to working at you know what I mean don't do something out of the ordinary uh you need to know how to use your dick to get into Netflix exactly I tried to go fast in a code review for a security job legit forgot how to count to five exactly when you try to be impressive you won't be impressive just be exactly what you're good at you know what I mean do exactly what you're good at and that is it that's it you know people always try to go they they you try to it's like it's like you try to show a side of yourself that doesn't exist never going to work out uh it's just never going to work out all right hey like And subscribe hey go check out coding sloth this was fantastic by the way coding sloth was great like And subscribe on coding sloth go check them out good videos good guy fantastic let's go let's go great editing great storytelling felt like everything about that was absolutely fantastic
