this is Jonathan Pedro welcome to the symbolic world [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right everybody I am back with Jonathan pajel on his own channel interviewing him about a very important event coming up that you're going to want to know all about was that a good intro Jonathan that was perfect great okay here we go so what are we talking about today and so we are talking about the symbolic World Summit we you know this is something that has been kind of floating around for a long time we might have done it already if it wasn't for kovid but now we we're going to do it and so Neil he came back to me and he was we have to we have to get together in person we have to you keep saying that we have to meet in person with people and not just meet online and so let's do this yeah I totally agree well every time we've gotten together in person this is something that's come up and we've talked about because it's got to be one of the most requested things around the symbolic world is an actual in-person conference it's long overdue so we're looking at here I'm looking at the dates we're looking at 2024 February 29th through the 2nd in Tarpon Springs Florida now if you're not familiar with Tarpon Springs let's talk about that a little bit have you ever been Jonathan no I've never been to Target at one point it was the sponge capital of the world which is one of his strange claims to fame well but when it comes to sponge diving and the Greek technique of sponge diving it became such a popular spot that uh it is now the um I guess it's the largest Greek population per capita in the United States so there's a number of Orthodox Church there and great people there and there's a wonderful church called Saint Nicholas um they had a weeping icon of Saint Nicholas in the 1970s you can actually see that if you come and uh the town has got some of the best Greek food and it's got a wonderful Conference Center so it uh it felt like the ideal location when we were talking with the promoters because it's so close to all the parks in Orlando it's close to beaches in Clearwater it's close to Tampa there's lots of airports lots of places to stay easy to get in some of the most incredible eating in Florida which is saying saying a lot so I think it's you know it just makes perfect sense because who doesn't want to come to Florida uh late February early March yeah especially if you're from Canada and so and so we we bounce it around and we have a theme it's called restoring the cosmic image basically we are we feel like we're at this point of reenchantment you know we feel like things are kind of moving in that direction and it's becoming possible again to recapture a more embodied and more connected vision and participation in the world so we're gonna try to explore that together all the all the the people that are coming we have some amazing speakers you want to announce some of the speakers Neil oh I do uh well you can tell us about them so we have uh first off we're gonna go with Martin Shaw now for those people who don't know Martin Shaw you're going to love him so if you've been following the channel and you haven't seen Martin on the channel or speaking with Jonathan uh Jonathan like what is his what is his real like title like he's an actual mythographer which means that he he's a Stanford professor of Mythology but he's also someone who like lives in the woods for months at a time and and uh and does all these crazy things he's that he's an amazing Storyteller his stories are wonderful he's he really is that ancient kind of Storyteller he he used to do a version of the of the Odyssey in nine days where he would tell the story for like nine days straight and he was able to keep people's attention he said half of the people would go crazy and then the other half would just be completely like locked in uh and so he's an amazing Storyteller we've already did some we did some events in in England and in Ireland together and we have a a really great Rapport and we have a lot of Sparks that fly when we when we exchange we discuss her he's gonna he's gonna talk and then the big well he's well you know just interrupt you cutting in no uh I when I've heard him talk like the way he illuminates things and like how excited I get as an artist and someone who thinks like this it's it's almost like he's impossible it's like I didn't know there was a person like him or a person could be that committed to this and that engaging on the subject so I that when you when you mentioned him I thought that was like the most perfect fit and so the second speaker uh is the one that a lot of people from the Sabbath world are going to be excited about we have father Stephen DeYoung who's going to come speak to us and that is going to be that it's going to be amazing so I'm really excited to have him be there exchanging with all the symbolic world people exchanging with me exchanging with Neil you know have you met father Stephen not yet no uh uh tease him online that's about it it's incredible I mean the Lord of spirits podcast is just got to be one of my favorite podcasts period uh the stuff father Stephen knows and the way he articulates it I feel like what I learned from him sometimes is like stuff I thought I was going to have to wait you know to get to Paradise to ask God about and like Father Stephen can illuminate some of these things so I mean that's quite a setup I'm sure but uh I mean I don't think anyone's going to be disappointed to meet him or even ask them their own strange questions about Giants in person in person so Martin Sean father Stephen they're going to be the headlining speakers with myself and then we're going to have all these different paths for different types of people and uh so there'll be like main events with everybody together and then we'll also have pass for artists that will be headed up uh by our friend Neil right here yeah I'm excited to do that I've invited Vesper Stamper if you guys are familiar with Vesper uh she's uh I guess you could call her a Renaissance woman uh she's quite a racketeer herself as as far as storytelling um she's a visual artist she was been she's been a musician and she's a well-published author um and so we're gonna tag team that event and hopefully help artists answer some of the toughest questions they've been asking which is how do I integrate the symbolic thinking and symbolism into my storytelling how do I integrate it into my artwork uh we're gonna I'm gonna answer questions like that and we're gonna go on even to more practical stuff about publishing your work finishing your work getting it out there all right so then we have another path which is going to be the universal history path with everybody knows who's going to be doing that it'll be Richard Roland and he will have someone too but we don't know he might have someone helping him out but we're not sure who yet and then we have a third path which is going to be what is the third path called it's like you guys had mentioned it is it's about grounding symbolism in The home and in your life something to do with the Hearth like yeah so like how to integrate symbolism into your actual life well there's another thing going on the very first night we get there that is the biggest that is the biggest thing that's gonna happen that has me the most excited so what is it well uh you know so we are getting back on the road Dirk Paul Robbins and we're gonna do our release show uh on February 29th the very first night leap year leap year we're gonna take the leap and we're gonna do a concert at the symbolic World um releasing our new completed record firebird and so that's amazing so we have the chance to see Drupal Robbins in concert first time ever like my kids they told me they want to come now to this event just because of that they didn't want to come before but when they found out that durable Robbins is playing at the symbolic World Summit they're like Dad we got to go to Florida so so that is really exciting so you got to be there in person to see it there's no other way to see it uh we're not doing a ton of touring next year so we've got a couple of shows leading up to that one and a few shows afterwards but that's probably going to be our one of our bigger events of the Year all right so we're looking at you know around 500 people there's maybe a little possibility for a few more we've got VIP tickets and then we've got regular tickets uh people if you want some of those VIP tickets you definitely have to come in early because those are going to go really fast and it's going to be a great time also just to meet people from the symbolic World be people in person uh people that are have been on my Channel people that have had me on their channels it's going to be I think it's going to be great to actually to just be there with and have sit around a table and talk to people right now is there going to be like a social channel on the website because I know you have some pretty cool social features uh for people to interact in your website which I which I would recommend leading into the concert a concert conference and concert and concert as well yeah so people can sign up to the symbolicworld.com we have a community there that is thriving we have amazing things going on already discussions about novels so on the community right now we're already having the Beowulf course we also have a course on CS Lewis and the space Trilogy by Andy Crawford there's going to be a course on metaphysics coming with JP Marceau so it's really the place to already rev up your relationships get to know people get a sense of who's coming so that so that once we arrive already we're ready to
