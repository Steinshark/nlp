ladies and gentlemen if you're into crypto you like shilling it you like saying bitcoin to the moon you might want to pay attention because new actions for the department of justice could mean you could be going to jail for a very long time if you're not careful just like john mcafee here he said i'm john mcafee world's leading security expert if i don't want to be found i will not be found this is before he got arrested and now indicted for cryptocurrency fraud ladies and gentlemen welcome to the 10 million dollar study i'm your host coffee zilla the internet detective and today we're talking about the new rules of the road um these were always the rules but now they're starting to get enforced obviously and yeah it's it's gonna be an interesting time so let's give a little context right i think everyone knows who john mcafee is he's an outspoken sort of outlaw of the internet created the mcafee anti-virus but then kind of just lived his crazy life if you want to know more about that and i encourage you it's fascinating go check out my buddy okie's weird stories he has the best like documentary series he's got a great one on uh john mcafee it's fascinating you learn about you know accusations of neighbors that john mcafee may or may not have killed i mean the man lives the craziest life which is kind of made him into a bit of an anti-hero it's a bit easy to root for him because he's so kind of on the one hand eccentric on the other hand kind of a way self-aware of his distastefulness and his sort of criminality but just like scarface or al capone was never indicted for you know his his worst crimes but instead indicted for tax evasion in the same way it looks like john mcafee's going down for the same stuff for all the things that he's done and been a part of you would have thought he would have gone to jail probably a long time ago and indeed he's been in hiding for a very long time but instead it looks like crypto and taxes are gonna be what brings him down so before we get into the whole cryptocurrency fraud scheme let's just talk about who john mcafee is as a guy so this was a thread from 2017 where it says so one bitcoin to 500k within three years and john mcafee is the type of guy that would respond if not i will he eat my dick until national television that's the kind of man john mcafee but moving on to the more serious allegations john mcafee is accused of promoting coins altcoins specifically uh to his twitter followers in exchange for payment and not disclosing it and these are things people need to pay attention to i've seen a lot of crypto youtubers do this they will take payment and coins and then not ever disclose that they've taken payment hey you might go to jail for very long time john mcafee stands to go to jail for 60 years so how do you get himself in that much trouble well he sent out this tweet around the same time he was promising you know the three-year the three-year bullish bet over there he was saying each day i will talk about a unique altcoin most of the 2000 coins are trash or scams i've read every white paper the few i'm connected to i will tell you the rest i have no position in these coins will change the world you can support that change well at the same time he starts promoting a bunch of coins and instead of disclosing what he's interested in or he has a position he actually does the opposite according to the complaint they scalped at least 11 altcoins during the period from 2017 on through early 2018 and these all coins were electroneum burst coin did you buy red coin you get the idea dogecoin is one of them but basically the reason he is in trouble is not because he promoted them but because he didn't disclose that he was invested in them or he was getting a kickback which means for you guys at home if you're talking about cryptocurrency with your friends it's fine talk about it as much as you want but if you have a public platform and you're gonna promote these coins and you're getting paid for it if you don't disclose it you run serious risk of uh yeah getting basically getting indicted for it which makes john mcafee's twitter claims that him and elon musk are the same because both of them promoted doge it makes it kind of pointless because the reason elon musk presumably promoted doge was as a meme the reason john mcafee seems to have promoted it was because he was getting paid he also says we were paid in the same coins that crashed the sec allegations are overblown but that's what a pump and dump is you get paid in it you sell it off to the people who buy it underneath you and then they get left holding the back john mcafee continues that even after it crashed i held every coin allocated to me i never sold a single coin i believed in the company to the very end he's talking about dokademik but all it takes is proving that really he didn't disclose that he paid for these coins that he was pumping and therefore misleading his followers into risky investments for this case to really stick i mean come on the only thing from here is whether he's gonna be in a spanish jail cell or an english jail cell i believe he's arrested in spain right now but uh the us is trying to extradite him to america so this is a big lesson number one even if you're a leading security expert and you don't want to be found you will not be found the long arm of the law probably will find you if they want to find you when you get cocky like this and say if they really wanted you'd be caught in a fortnight and you start to brag about how secure you are chances are you're going down very soon as for my own personal opinion of john mcafee i think if he lives up to his former promise i think all the charges should be immediately dropped i don't think they will be uh but i think you know we should at least offer him the opportunity to fulfill his into the bargain here and even if you think john mcafee is innocent and shouldn't be uh you know indicted on any charges i think this tweet kind of sums it all up john mcafee says my life has been devoted to my life my family's my loves my ambitions generosity's fears and desires my apparent selflessness helping others was still about me yeah i mean that's sort of the entire cryptocurrency allegation right you said you were helping others by helping them sift through cryptocurrencies in reality you were enriching yourself which is fraud and if you get convicted of these allegations he will probably be going to jail and basically and rot there until he is dead that's the cold hard fact and i think it's a lesson to any would-be crypto pumper or any investment pumper at all because there's so much of it going on guys you have to be so careful with your money you never know who is your best interest at heart or who's taking money on the side um so please be careful and if you're a crypto guy please don't send out investment advice if you're getting paid behind the scenes because there's a very real chance that you could end up behind bars anyways that's it thanks for watching go check out my buddy oaky's weird stories and i will see you guys next time wake up and smell the coffee
