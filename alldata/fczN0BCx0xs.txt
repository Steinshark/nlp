okay so I have a puzzle for you we got a hexagon here and I want to know how many ways can you draw in three non-intersection diagonals of the hexagon to split it up into four triangles so here's an example and we're going to count rotations as different so this is not going to be the same as say this one the question is how many ways are there in total the answer is 14 so we can think about this one we get six rotations of this one then we also have this one where we have a little zigzag and again this has six rotations and the remaining two are triangles our little equilateral triangle ones so this gives 14 ways in total does beg the question what about if we use a pentagon for example uh we want to look one level simpler so this time instead of splitting into four triangles with three lines I'm going to split it into three triangles with two lines and hopefully you believe me that this is one way and that the other ways are all going to be rotations of this so there are five ways in total okay going back level simpler Square well there are going to be two of these now we use one line to split into two triangles so there are two ways a triangle we use no lines to split it into one triangle and there's one way of doing that and I'm even going to say a 2d shape and we're going to split it into no triangles and we're going to say there's one way of doing that as well so we've got our little pattern here one one 2 5 14 got another problem for you now um now this is going to talk about something called binary trees so binary trees we start at a node and at each point you can either choose to do nothing or split it so here this is called a binary tree of order three because down here we've got three nodes at the bottom now another binary tree of order three might look like this and in fact these are these are the only two binary trees of order three how many binary trees do we think there are of order four well start drawing them we've got one like this we can then maybe do that oh and we can reflect this one now so then we get this and we can also reflect this one oh and actually there is one more we can get so I'm fairly confident these are all of them there are five for completeness sake of order two there is precisely one and of order one there is also just one so again we've got one one 2 five do you want have a guess at how many binary trees of order five there are there are actually 14 binary trees of order five so the pattern is 1 1 2 5 14 H which is the same as this one so this third problem involves something called got to get the German pronunciation right de words named after the mathematician de pronounced with a long ey sound in the middle so de words are made up of the same number of x's and y's but there's a rule um at no point in the word can you have had more y's than X's before that point so for example something like x x y y is allowed something like X Y YX is not allowed because at this point if we cut it off here there are two y's and only one X's so the number of x's must be greater than or equal to the number of y's at all points in a sequ quence so how many de words are there for certain lengths well if we have none of each I guess that there's one one way of having the empty de word I just draw a box to symbolize that is here if we have one x one y it has to be X then y because if it's y than x then we've got more y's than X's what about if we have two of each well we can have XX y y we could also have X Y X Y we can't have x y y X as I've said and it's going to have to start with an x if it starts with a y then we failed at the first step now what about with three of each so we can have x x x y y y we could have x x y x y y we could also actually have x x y y x y how about x y x x y y and then we can alternate we can have X Y X Y X Y okay these are all the Deep words with 3 x's and three y's now do you want try guessing how many deep words there are with four x's and four y's it's 14 so we've got this one one 2 54 patent again so there must be something special about these numbers and these actually have a special name they're called the Catalan [Music] numbers but first I want to look into why these problems are all the same um because we can actually show it um in a really cool way so I'm going to draw in the rest of these pentagons just so that we can use the pentagons as an example so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to label some of the edges of the pentagons and these edges are going to form my nodes so they're going to form these bits at the bottom of the binary tree it's going to become clear soon and then actually we've got some interior nodes here as well so let's draw these in and these are going to be within the triangles this currently might seem a bit confusing however let's now join up the lines going step by step so at this point we can see we've got one interior node we can only go through edges and if you imagine this uncoiling we're going to end up with this CU we've still got our dots in exactly the same place and our end points in exactly the same place so these two represent the same thing similarly if we get this one okay uncoiled this one's going to look like this one uncoiled we can do this with all of them so it makes sense that these represent the same things in different ways which is why we have the same pattern okay what about these two now well for this I'm actually going to label the little edges between nodes and I'm going to label them X if they go left and Y if they go right first we go X then we have to go through an X to get there and we have to go through an X to get there the next One X but we've already ticked that one off X y take this y off to get here x we've ticked off Y and this one is just y so this can represent XX X Y y y which is this code so this one first node got to go through X then X to get there the next node we go x y That's not ticked off X now to get to this one x y y and we've got y so this x x y x y y is this code and actually all of these binary trees represent a de word like that so these again are different ways of representing the same thing which is why we end up with the same answer and that is these Catalan numbers we need a formula for them we like formulas in math we like to know how we can name these patterns um and for this I'm going to get another bit of paper and actually I'm going to look at it through the de words if we have nx's and n y y well in total that's that's two n characters isn't it and we want to pick which of the nend spaces are going to be X's so in general there are two n choose n words with nx's and N y's but not all of these are going to be deep words so we're going to have to work out how we can do that let's look at an example try x y y x this isn't a deep word but I'm going to do a neat little trick and I'm going to add an X before it so why am I doing this well it kind of makes our condition easier because before the condition was that the number of x's is greater than or equal to the number of y's at any point in the sequence adding an extra X before means that for the last four digits to be a de word then for the whole sequence the number of x's needs to be strictly greater than the number of y's so we're making this condition slightly more specific and actually the definition for here of this criteria is it's dominating now there's a really cool trick you can do here because we're going to cycle this round through all the Cycles so we've got x x y YX going to move this x to the beginning so we'll have x x this x goes here this y goes here y goes there and finally x y y x x so we've got five different cycles of our original word and the co thing is that exactly one of them has this property um in this case it is this one so this one doesn't because if you think at this point we've got 2 X's two y's so they're equal so we don't have that greater than condition but this is the case where precisely one of them is dominating hasard its property and it's always going to be the case that of these Cycles exactly one of them is dominating and then we can get rid of our actual X and from this we know because it's the same condition that well one over n + 1 of the possible arrangements are deep words so this means that our formula for the catalon numbers is 1 / n + 1 * 2 N chose n wellow there's still more you can say I could sit here and talk for about an hour about Catalan numbers but there is I think one final thing that I'm going to bring up um those of you who are interested there are iterative formulas you can find out about ways to relate CN to cn+ 1 but this can also be written as 2 N choose n minus 2 N choose n minus one whenever I see something like this with um choose notation something combinatorial I think Pascal's triangle where is this in Pascal's triangle um and this is where it becomes cool so unfortunately my friends have been subjected to so many Pascal's triangles talks I think I gave my first when I was about 12 fun this place I've told a friend about Pascal's triangle is when we were climbing a mountain um I had it written out on my hand so that I could explain what was going on um and she actually enjoyed it she asked for it that time so if you ever want a Pascal's triangle talk there's never a time when I am not ready okay running out of space slightly but this will do the question is where do the Catalan numbers appear in Pascal's triangle and this little minus sign is the key um cuz they actually appear this column and subtracting this column so 1 - 0 is our first one 2 - 1 is our second one 6 - 4 gives the two this gives the five and to finally finish off 17 - 56 it is 14 yes so that is the Catalan numbers here are the first 30 Catalan numbers you can see they escalate now if expanding your mind is something you'd like to do well brilliant.org is the place to do it this is an absolute smallus Board of
