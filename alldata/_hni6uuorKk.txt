I took on the challenge to do 20,000 push-ups and pull-ups combined in 30 days I did it for eight days got hurt now I'm back I'm gonna finish the job that I started that means every day doing 34 rounds of 15 push-ups five pull-ups and ten squats I'm using this clicker thing to keep track of the rounds first day 34 done last time around is one of the toughest things for me mentally and physically I build up my base I've lost weight I'm continuing to lose weight I'm ready for this to hit hard and to get the job finished it's gonna take a lot to stop me this time a lot of people told me I mean you do numbers like these especially for 30 days you're going to get hurt I don't care I've been doing sports my whole life I've wrestled did combat sports my whole life I weighed lifted my whole life I've done crazy things athletically in my whole life I know what I'm doing that said I know how risky how crazy how tough this is on the body and yes injury is a real possibility in fact on day 3 is when my rachel is done to develop pain an old familiar overuse pain that I know well and I kept pushing I kept pushing and pushing because pain is one thing injuries another so I kept really sensing of is it getting closer and closer to injury this was the hardest mental challenge for me is there's times where I had to lay face down on the carpet just doubting everything about my life what am I doing with my life just all the flood of excuses coming into my head that the shoulder it was all coming from the shoulder the shoulder was running in the body the brain couldn't do anything with it and I think I'm really proud of pushing as far as eight days through that but then I started to feel that injury is going to become a real possibility so that's when I took a break on all the upper body exercises and started to do the recovery ice and Bend exercises that I can talk about in another time every single day and I still ran six miles every single day until today today I'm restarting that challenge I finished the six miles again and the 34 rounds fifteen push-ups five pull-ups and ten squats now this is just some silly exercises but a lot of people have told me that I'm going to get injured a lot of people in my other aspects of my work have told me that I'm going to burn out I'm gonna work too hard those people need to unfollow me that advice is obvious millions of people will tell you to do this it's obvious you should get enough sleep you should get a healthy moderate dose of exercise you should have a diet you should have a balanced life the thing that I need and I believe the thing that a lot of people need is not that kind of advice they need a small number of people around them to support them to push harder to work harder to take the risks the quote unquote dumb thing to take the risk of injury to take the risk of burnout in the name of passion in the name of discovering something about yourself that's why I took on this challenge that's why I'm talking to the crazy David Goggins not because I'm trying to establish a healthy lifestyle but because I'm trying to discover something about myself on the way of establishing a healthy lifestyle I believe it's nonzero probability of me taking and finishing this challenge that's why I took it on that's why I kept pushing through the pain to discover something about myself the kind of things I need to fix up about the way I do the exercises but also mentally the most important things that mentally now that said I didn't even hit you no David Goggin talks about the 40% rule I don't think I even get gotten to like the 5% for me I am I know how to suffer and there are things in this life I'm willing to suffer for they have to do much more with the things my main passions in life and work and artificial intelligence there's things I'm really willing to put in the work push-ups and pull-ups is not one of them at the end of the day I want to establish a healthy habit where every single day I'm doing some running is some bad weight exercises that takes under an hour that just keeps me healthy keeps me feeling good keeps me moving keeps my immune system strong keeps me feeling great I think there's a magic to exercise for clearing the mind for just giving you this vibrant energy to hit whatever the heck you're working on in the rest of the day I really think that people in academic circles and research circles just engineers in general need to get their butts out there and do some exercise I think this huge amount of value to that even if it's just walking get 10,000 15,000 20,000 steps a day and he's a huge value to that I think a long time ago I decided that I'm going to have to suffer to reach my goals and one of the things I learned about myself at least maybe this applies to others that the ability to withstand suffering to really withstand the grind is a kind of muscle that needs to be trained you really do need to do something difficult every day this push up pull up thing is a representation of that but I do something difficult every day if you're following along make sure you do something that's just a little bit crazy hey you push the limits do not injure yourself permanently but do push yourself to point we learn something about yourself ignore all the excuses that your head comes up with for not doing it get your butt out there every single day try to get some miles in if you run or walk or bike or whatever and try to do some some things for the upper body some bodyweight exercises there's zero excuses not to do this in this pandemic one of the biggest things you can do for yourself is to get the diet right to get the exercise right so get out there good luck stay healthy stay hard and I'll see you at the end of this 20,000 crazy push up on pull-up thing that I promise I'll do and I'll get the job done no matter what oh one more thing I know you're probably somebody out there it's probably typing how they didn't sign up to be listening to some Russian do you talk about some exercises they want some artificial intelligence lectures content whatever the heck that's what I do that's my main passion but I also exercise I also play music I also love poetry in literature that's what you get if you don't like it unsubscribe it doesn't matter this is me I'm hoping to share and be open and real with people in my journey through
