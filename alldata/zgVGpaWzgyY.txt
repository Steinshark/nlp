so hello everybody i'm really excited to be here with nathan jacobs i met nathan several years ago as he was uh putting together a movie called becoming fully human um it was really exciting to see that he was aware of the spiritual crisis that we're going through let's say in the west and he was trying to kind of talk about it and propose some solutions but nathan is also a scholar who's associated uh with several universities he's written papers books he is a visual artist he makes paintings and illustrations commercial art and ultimately he's also a movie maker in also in a narrative sense where he has made a just a regular story movie and he's also working on some projects now so i think he's the perfect person to talk about the moment right now the moment in culture re-enchantment and how christian spirituality is related to that this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world nathan thanks for thanks for joining me in this conversation i'm happy that you uh were able to find some time to talk to me yeah my pleasure i'm uh it's it's been a while but i'm glad that we're able to talk so so maybe tell people a little bit like a very quick uh i mean it's difficult because your journey is extremely complex but maybe tell people a little bit about your journey of how you connect your art making with the scholarship and also with your own spiritual path towards orthodoxy sure yeah that is a long journey i'll see how briefly this is a long form you know yes it is a long-form discussion okay but i'll try to not spend all of it on that uh so i'm i'm sort of uh i suppose you could say i'm an artist turned scholar turned filmmaker which i really see is the convergence of those other two phases of my life uh so in terms of art i started in fine art a very classical sort of fine arts painting and drawing with maryland institute college of art baltimore um where i study that and uh and and that was really sort of my what i was all about right uh the visual arts but then what happened for me is uh i ended up going into a type of existential spiritual crisis specifically asking questions about immortality the afterlife god whether i have free will things like that um and that was uh induced rather peculiar i'll skip that story but i'll suffice it to say i was very interested in things like hallucinogenics and those played a heavy role in awakening those questions in me and that started me down this road of inquiry about philosophy and religion and that road took a lot of twists and turns i had a christian background my mother was a missouri senate lutheran so very conservative form of german lutheran um you know her being german lutheran uh and then uh but you know over time and my father was not anything which uh you know sort of created a certain dissonance in home obviously certain things being instilled by her but that created at least an inkling she was very interested in apologetic so i'd heard arguments in favor of christianity and christ and things like that so i took that seriously as something to be considered but as i dove into historical christianity and sort of going down to its roots largely in the roots of western christianity started in august and sort of worked my way out into the ancient influences and philosophy and then forwarded to the way that developed in scholastic philosophy and then on into modernity uh the more i became disillusioned with christianity actually and over time became an opponent of it nonetheless i had certain spiritual inklings about the world i was convinced that god existed i was convinced also that there was a significance to christ but i just wasn't quite sure what that really looked like and so my own views were very um i suppose the charitable reading would be idiosyncratic uh the young charitable one would be heretical uh but nonetheless uh i i dove into all these different philosophies and um and that that journey went through you know bachelors of philosophy and masters and in church history and systematic theology and things like that on into phds uh a pair of phds and so i i ended up doing that whole journey um and along the way sort of started out hopeful that maybe there was something in christianity became an opponent of christianity an advocate of the god of the philosophers and all sorts of ideas that would not be in keeping with historical christianity until in my doctoral studies i discovered the easter church fathers and i recognized this radical difference between the worldview i was reading about there and what i had studied for years in in western christianity and that initially just intrigued me in its own right because i thought i had mastered the systems of christian thinking and so what on earth am i staring at here uh so at first it was just intrigue and then over time the more i dove into it and explored well specifically metaphysics uh metaphysics is my area of main interest um and the metaphysics that was there uh over time i became persuaded of the worldview itself and then when i discovered it was still a lived practice right there was actually an orthodox church gorgeous orthodox church only two blocks from where i lived at the time so i went in there and saw sure enough i sort of scrutinized it because i was skeptical that there was still a through line you know between what i've been reading in ancient writers and that but sure enough there was uh that ended up sucking me in and you know you fast forward seven years later and i'm an orthodox christian um but along the way also in there i had this convergence with film where i had this opportunity i had always loved movies and i loved the idea of making movies uh and it was for a variety of reasons part of it was because i saw them as sort of the contemporary cathedrals right these these works of art that required so many different artists and skill sets and talents to come together which is why all those credits are there in the end that come together and make something that one person can make on their own and so i just love that and i love that mode of storytelling and all that uh but it's you know who does that for a living that's not a real job right like people don't really do those sorts of things uh but um i had this opportunity because of certain artists i was meeting in the in the film world along the way in my journey of studying philosophy and theology who were impressed with my talents i had a background you know in not only art but i paid the bills during my time of you know academic study in the commercial arts arena doing digital art as you mentioned i was a 3d character modeler i did i worked in the video game industry uh and uh and so they saw my work and they were impressed with that they were willing to work with me and so at some point i just couldn't resist that the idea of i get to make a movie so um its own long story but i pulled together a team and resources and all this and eventually so did the heavy lifting get off the ground my first feature narrative movie which was killing poe uh this um which is an ensemble college comedy um it's nicely layered the way like a wes anderson movie is layered but it's not um it's not terribly deep i wouldn't point to it as you know this is you know rich philosophical content even though i think it's a good movie but all of those things once i had you sort of fast forward i'm an orthodox christian i'm a college professor i'm well published in philosophy you know in areas like not only modern philosophy like immanuel kant so that also ancient philosophy in the church college um and i've made a movie now uh what emerged was a group came to me who was interested in this trend and culture considering they're religiously unaffiliated and they said you seem like a great candidate to do something on this right because you well first of all your former nun right religiously unaffiliated i suppose i should define that right the nuns n-o-m-e-s right people who have no religious affiliation as opposed to like a catholic man um you always need to get that out of the way in this in this topic but um so they came to me about that trend and they said you know you're a former nun you know you're an orthodox christian now um you you teach in colleges so you have exposure to this demographic or you know at least a large portion of this demographic uh you're an artist you're a filmmaker we'd be curious to see what you would do with this topic and so i pitched a really sort of an experimental documentary type film that would look at this group and open up a discussion both for the nuns themselves and for folks who are religiously affiliated and and lo and behold they said they'd finance it and that's what became becoming truly human which was the documentary that you referred to and i thought that was just going to be this sort of brief aside where i stepped out of academia for a year hit pause i was teaching at university of kentucky at the time in the philosophy department and then i just go back to teaching but anyway that just sort of opened doors where folks said we really like what you do and your unique voice in film and we'd like to get behind you and and so i decided to take the risk of jumping out and saying well i'll keep sort of affiliated in the academy and continue to publish and speak and things like that but i'm going to try to try to try this road in film because i love the convergence of ideas and art in this storytelling genre and so anyway fast forward now um you know i have an arrangement i now do this for a living i have a first look deal uh with a a subsidiary of of lionsgate right the movie studio uh and i'm working on a host of other projects that are in development now um so i still publish i still speak uh i'm associated with vanderbilt uh divinity school specifically their arts and culture program over there um but i suppose i suppose i can say i now make movies for a living or something like that anyway yeah which is great which is a crazy thing to say in a certain manner because like you said not a lot of people get to say that so that's one yeah that's right so so there you have it that's me and so i think that you're really at an interesting point of convergence you know i a lot of the people that are watching this video have been feeling this change in culture let's say a return of narrative they've been noticing it a return a kind of re-enchantment in the world and noticing how let's say storytelling especially how right now in hollywood in a lot of the movies that are coming out there's a lot of politics in it there's a lot of almost propaganda like it's pushing towards certain ideologies and everything uh and realizing that good storytelling is one of the solutions to that problem um and how so how do you see that what is your perception let's say of the place of storytelling right now in culture and how we how it can affect the world uh yeah i mean i do think that one of the things that you're trying that you're starting to see is this this shift in how um folks uh take in information and so much of that has to do with the the general impressions the fact that we can sort of dive into and become engrossed in in an entire world uh that you know and and by an entire world i mean on the on the one hand that that goes to things like video games right we have these essentially virtual worlds and obviously we're moving into things like metaverse where it's even more so uh but even i would say when you look at things like the the i the phenomena of binge watching where you end up being able to tell long storm long-form storytelling uh in episodic ways uh that's a totally new phenomenon and actually just sort of on that one of the show i'm working on a show which i don't think i'm at the liberty to say what it is but we're we're in the midst of writing season one um which will hopefully be launching uh probably a year from now but i it was such a shift in my mind from everything i'd learned about movie writing you know script writing to uh to writing for an episodic series because in movie writing you're always up against this script you know page limit right you go over 100 pages right and if you can come in under that that's great and usually that means a lot of condensing every line has to be very precise and get rid of that thing here and where can we cut whereas as soon as i started working on an episodic series it was strange to realize you get to just sit there and live with characters and let them have inconsequential conversations in insofar as you're just developing these characters i actually remember the first notes i got back on the first episodic script i wrote was hey could you add could you add this one like long contemplative speech in this part here where they meander about about i thought i've never received a note anything like that can you add a disposable speech that's them contemplating you know the existential place in which they find themselves but that's part of the whole you know inhabiting those worlds and getting to know those characters in a way that you can't in the shorter form of storytelling and so i think what you're starting to see in in in those areas as well is something that used to be restricted to novels right you wouldn't be able to do that in a movie because it was just people didn't have the attention span for it plus it was typically in a theater right the technology has advanced in a way uh where we're starting to to be surrounded with those sorts of opportunities to engage in those worlds uh and so i think what you're starting to see is that the ways in which people take in story and see the world and inhabit worlds and find characters that they identify with and get to know is really revolutionized by on the one hand the technology and the place in which we find ourselves in history but then i think even kovit has changed it even further because people were forced into their homes and what did they retreat to uh and so sitting here on the inside of sort of the movie industry i'm hearing all the conversations that are taking place about whether or not theatrical is forever changed and sort of forever in a different place if not dead you know and whether episodic and all these sort of streaming things are are the new way to go um which on the one hand is disruptive and scary for folks who have nostalgia for movies like me i love going to the movie theater uh on the other hand uh i think it's actually going to amplify in some ways the ways in which we take in story and taken story in a long form uh that is much different than what we typically have in the past in this sort of visual media and so on so i don't know if that goes to the question that you're asking i mean i think kind of maybe one of the things that i've seen grow in the past 20 years maybe 10 years even more so is something like fandoms for example so one of the things you see in fandoms is you see people who attribute identity to these fictional worlds they attribute they put their identity into into these kind of uh whatever it's manga or whatever it's star wars and all these different fictional worlds and they have a desire to a certain extent to participate and so the whole aesthetic of the of fan fiction the whole aesthetic of cosplay um and one of the things that i've noticed is that this seems to be marking a difference from just passive entertainment where people are looking to find worlds in which to inhabit because in a way they are dealing with the nuns problem that is they're dealing with a lack of cosmic story in which they can participate um which is something christianity afforded us and now they because the scientific kind of materialist world doesn't have much that to offer you have a you have a scientific materialist type who's obsessed with like my little pony or like or star wars or whatever it is that people get obsessed with um and so that's been my kind of reflection about how people are starting to notice how stories are that world building in the fictional sense is actually something which exists in our actual life and we need as a a narrative frame to to in which we can inhabit yeah well i noticed this in a slightly different way actually initially not because of so much film but as much as the the research with the nuns so um and this kind of goes to a project that i've been i'm that is currently in well it's more than in development it's sort of in the financing stage in preparation for production but and again i can't really say specifics about what it is but i think the background of it uh sort of goes to this and was the first time i was awakened to the phenomena that you're talking about um so when i was working on becoming truly human um you've seen it obviously i don't i won't presume that everybody who's listening to this has seen it uh but there's a series of interviews with nuns right this group of nuns that's supposed to be a representative sample of uh folks who are religiously unaffiliated and uh in preparation for that you know me and my producer we went out and we screened interviewed i don't know 60 plus religiously unaffiliated folks uh with sort of standard form types of questions that we wanted to know where they stand on this investment and uh over time in that data gathering there was this sort of odd data point that emerged out of the process one that i it doesn't show up in the documentary but it definitely made an impression on me which was that a 100 of the nuns that i interviewed believed in ghosts and that was a surprise to me and what was especially surprising was okay in general the nuns are not atheists right so 90 of the nuns on my finding and that's actually the same with pew uh in their finding uh 90 of them believe in at least god or a higher power only 10 would identify as atheists but even the atheists right who were like i don't believe in god science science science my apartment is haunted right and i thought that was so bizarre and so interesting that i thought you know even the atheists believe in the government in god or not i'm sorry maybe even the agent that was completely incorrect even the atheists believe in ghosts right i thought well so this is is this an anomaly right of my sample but then i saw this this uh article i think it was in new york magazine um by clay rutledge sociologist who had also studied the nuns and um and the article was titled something like that don't believe in god how about ufos and uh and the whole article was about the fact that if you think who the nuns are are scientific materialist mechanical philosophers you know or something like that you don't understand who the nuns are and he talked about his entire study was about how um the sort of the way in which as folks diverge from religion there's this increased interest in the paranormal and the occult and that was what his entire study was on and so looking at his research i saw that he saw the same pattern there and um and it's interesting because one of the patterns that you began to see there was well there were really two things that that clay identified which i had also noticed the one is that as the narrative of religion was diverged from there was a different search for a cosmic narrative that began to fill in there was was a sort of ad-hoc worldview being formed concerning karma or fate right the cosmos bringing about certain certain things to me right that are meaningful uh there was a belief that the world itself is spiritual there's the the belief that our world is haunted right and some of those spirits are good some are evil um and uh and then and and that was sort of that paranormal occult uh sort of world view uh was what started to fill in that gap and uh and it wasn't only just ghosts right in paranormal culture there's several subcultures right there's alien culture there's cryptozoology you know culture and uh and what you're starting to see if you pay attention to the subcultures is them talking to each other and starting to form new narratives based on the ways in which well maybe you know maybe there's there is a spiritual dimension to the mothman and it's not just some sort of strange crypto uh creature or something like that anyway you're starting to see these new narratives uh emerge out of that um from the the dialogue between them uh but but one of the things that's also interesting is in in rutledge's research what he was looking at specifically was also the connection between the subjective sense of meaningfulness and the delving into the paranormal and the occult and what he found was there was an inverse relationship um where the you know the more you went into the paranormal and the occult the lower your sense of subjective meaning went um and that's not surprising to me because i believe the occult is demonic and so so if it's really true that that's a spiritual vacuum of darkness right and the deeper you go into it the less you know meaning you should feel right it should cause that sort of vacuum-like state um and but what rutledge also you know at least speculates about is that then the turn towards certain social issues like social activism or whatever it may be starts to become the new sort of phase on the heels of that right as the paranormal and the occult begins to disappoint and fail to provide a satisfying narrative uh there's a new narrative that emerges that you know sort of drives you in that direction um and then also i would point to there was a dissertation i'm blanking on the name but i could dig it up dissertation that i looked at in uh standing grand rapids not in grand rapids in michigan someplace anyway but on reconversion of nuts so folks myself who ultimately ended up turning to religion and the ways in which uh ultimately their final turn you know when they finally discover a religion that they can embrace they they embrace it fully much more fully than a lot of the folks who are culturally this or that religion uh and with that all of a sudden their beliefs uh you know adjust right so if they were you know heavily you know let's say left leaning in their politics also they might abandon some of those things as they engage in certain uh religious beliefs because those were actually symptomatic of the search for something else it wasn't that those beliefs were driving them and so what you see is you see all these phases of of narrative trading going on whereas the religion is providing one sort of storytelling and way of looking at the world paranormal comes to fill in the gap when you abandon that if that fails you turn to a certain social narrative and if you rediscover religion you quickly abandon that one too uh and i think all of this really does go to the point that you're talking about of the sense that the idea of having some sort of framework by which to understand the world some sort of storytelling that holds it all together and uh and places me within in a story uh it seems to be something that humans just absolutely need we can't get away from right it's it's it's part of our very essential nature to look at the world in that in that way yeah you're totally right you know the just just now was it uh klaus schwab just published his latest book called the great narrative and so it's like the world economic forum basically telling us the primacy of narrative and how the world needs a story you know in which to inhabit in order to kind of get through our our problems and it's and it's like yeah they realize that this is necessary now the question is what will that story be it's interesting like you said that the what we get let's say as christianity wanes although at first it looks like atheism it ends up being something more like a kind of confused or broken down paganism of all these stories and and conflicting narratives and the fact that people are obsessed with unexplained phenomena right so it's like an unexplained phenomena can obviously not give you united meaning it's the very name unexplained phenomena is that you're constantly peering out in the darkness like with squinted eyes and trying to figure out what these with these things are um you know and so so obviously it's going to lead to this kind of this kind of breakdown in meaning that people experience or the kind of a kind of weird nihilism that still believes in ghosts and and all these strange phenomena right i mean i do think this is an interesting miscontemporary misunderstanding of mystery right because oftentimes what folks who are are interested in that that sort of unexplained phenomena uh it's mystery is something that draws them in and yet when you look at the concept of mystery in the ancient world sure you know uh you know like this concept you know the mystery that the word itself you know originally like it's it's it's a verb that means to shut and it and and it refers to the mystery cults right the initiation into mystery belts where you check your eyes your mouth the initiation ritual um and that's where you know plato starts to use that to refer to the mysterious one which is basically the initiated it's not the person who doesn't see right it's the person who's been initiated so they are familiar with the mysteries and then in christianity and clement of alexandria for example uh mystery then starts to be tied with people who again are initiated and are gnostics in the good sense right in the sense they're in the know um and they all of a sudden are able to see patterns that were there before so when you look at the old testament texts uh there are cryptic strange stories about people drowning and and you know and giants and all sorts of bizarre stuff and what does all this mean and uh and at least the way clement and then you know origin does the same thing uh the way they look at it is that those stories uh like in the icon of the transfiguration uh where christ you know goes up on mount tabor and he's he's transfigured and the apostles are there or certain apostles are there who see this uncreated light and then moses and elijah are also there in the bathing sort of spiritual reading of that was that uh the texts of the you know the law and the prophets are just cryptic texts the true meaning of which is evasive unless you actually see them bathed in the light of christ and so having been initiated you being the initiated ones into the mysteries actually now are in a position to understand what the patterns are there you can actually see them properly and so the irony is oftentimes people today will completely misuse the term mystery because it means that stuff that nobody really knows as opposed to what it actually meant which was you're initiated to know the stuff that people otherwise wouldn't yeah and i mean i think the fact that there's a notion that it's uh it's hidden or that it's secret or that it's it's a mystery and even in this there's a little bit of the way we understand it now which is that the the insight you get is beyond rational discourse and it's more experiential and so once you have that insight you can't you can't communicate it at the level of the insight that you have and like you said then through that perception and light you can then see the patterns in the world whereas the occultist and the cryptic zoologist is only obsessed with it's it's almost the opposite right it's always the opposite it's like facing all these things that i can't understand out here in the world all these phenomena that are opaque and thinking that that's the that's the mystery it's like if i could understand the mechanical causality right of bigfoot like if i could understand what species he is then i would like what like what would it hurt actually he would cease to be interesting right he would cease to be interested if i could understand the mechanics like if i could add bigfoot to the encyclopedia like all right but then okay like i that's very much the opposite of of uh of like you said this this idea of moving into the moving into the initiated uh mystery of uh you know of the light of the divine let's say that you find in the ancient stories it's very fascinating to see the opposite like i have a right in my town they opened the school of witchcraft like it's like a two-minute walk from my house you know and you can see it like just how just and it's also it's also the like the everything people criticized about christianity you know is just there in your face it's all about application it's like you know can i get this like what can i do to get this for myself like can i get this some something that they want like a lover or or something and you think wow man it's the all the things that people accuse christianity of is all there and this weird occult stuff but it's lacking the higher principle that unites it all together into like one coherent uh story so that's right yeah very interesting yeah um yeah and i i suppose one last thing on this i mean one of the things that i noticed uh early on when i first started looking at the religiously unaffiliated was it was interesting to me to see the perception of the phenomena by um well but both on the one hand sort of classical apologist old school sort of boomers um evangelical types and then um and then on the other side the new atheists and they both were interpreting the data the same way which was that they're like okay this means that there is a dispute going on between christianity and atheism and um because those are the only two apparently talking but there's a dispute going on between those two and uh and the atheists are winning and now this large spike means that they're all becoming atheists right thanks to the uh the the uh insightful arguments of the new atheists uh and what was fascinating to me when i looked at that is i realized two things first of all uh that's not true and incidentally just as aside before i finish this point it is interesting that with my documentary which sort of gives a platform to to the um to uh to the the nuns uh the people who hate it the most are the new atheists on the one hand and the you know very staunch evangelicals yeah because they're they're of the same nature they are the same nature and they're looking for the same thing right they're expecting to hear the same thing and so when it completely disappoints in that sense uh you know they're really upset because it doesn't reinforce what they're expecting to hear which they're expecting to hear exactly that right there's been this debate and new atheists are winning there's just no good answers and so on um but i think the the more accurate uh assessment of what's going on is that there's a real sense in which the new atheists and the classical sort of evangelical apologists they are cut from the same cloth they're just modernists there's nothing you're going to find in that discussion that you can't find in john locke and bishop barkley and you know and uh you know spinoza and hume and whoever right it's a modernist discussion just sort of reheated and put into the into the culture in its final phase we could say it's in its final phase and so the problem is though the nuns it's not that the nuns are looking at the discussion saying oh i think these guys are winning over here um they just don't connect with it they're not modernists and so what's happened is not that one side is winning the debate it's that both sides have lost the audience and so what you get is these nuns who these folks who have disconnected they're like well i don't connect with the the faith i was raised in there's something that's sort of missing there and which i do think is a mythologizing piece that you mentioned and so i've disconnected and gone on this journey but i also don't connect just as just as much i don't connect with the new atheists right that that's something i didn't connect with either and so i think what you find is the nuns are really because they don't have a clear guide through those things they're just certain spiritual ships at sea and i think that there's something good and there's something bad that's emerged out of that i think the good thing is that they function on what you might call intuitions right so there's certain moral intuitions that there is right and wrong now they're not doing it super sort of analytically right but they have this vague sense that there really is real right and wrong they have a vague sense there's meaning in the world they have a vague sense that meeting the what they mean by karma is obviously not you know an escape from a cycle of rebirth because most of them are unsure what happens when you die so uh but they do mean like what goes around comes around right uh good deeds and somehow come back to you in the cosmos and things like that and so there they have this intuition that justice and reward is somehow tied into this whole system so they have these they have a sense of the world is spiritual that they're spiritual they don't really know what to do with that on a practical level but there's all these sort of vague intuitions and i think um on the one hand i think there's something good and right about that right i think we are not just minds and so when we function like rationalists who neglect these other sort of ways of intuiting things about the world we really neglect something very important about understanding the world and so there's something to be said that's positive there but i think the problem is just like if it's you're purely a rationalist and you ignore those things uh if it's just intuitions without the guide of reason or anything like that you run into other problems and that's where you just get neopaganism which is exactly you know what you're talking about there yeah and the kind of new age mush or people you know falling into gurus and all that kind of stuff is just yeah it's a it's just all these different things that are going on as the christian narrative is being pulled out of society we're seeing all these things going on but i i do feel like there is a at least i've seen in the past few years there's been a new space that's been opening up for let's say for talking about christianity in in a new way or it's not a new way it's really the old way but it's it's right it's the new way that it's the way that people haven't heard which is exactly let's say i imagine the same fathers that you discovered saying gregory saint maximus the confessor all these fathers seem to be offering a a solution to the to the problem like to the problem of consciousness even the problem of you know the limit of the viewer all these questions that are happening in the different fields we can find in someone like say maximus you know i did a conversation with uh father maximus constance just a few weeks ago about zamax as a confessor i was really surprised like it went up until it went up to like twenty thousand views super fast i'm like this is a bit opaque a subject but no it's not to make a subject like say maximus is really key to to the issues that we're go that we're uh that we're uh dealing with now and so i mean maybe you can talk a little bit about how your encounter with the church fathers let's say shifted your own worldview and how it kind of led you out of this this of the rationalist mind yeah yeah i mean now that's a that's a big topic but sure let's let's see why not let's give it a whirl um so uh i think you know for me there were there were a couple of different things that was happening and i don't know that i could talk about the way they they were such an antidote to where i was at without talking about exactly where i was at um so when i delve into um you know historical christianity optimistically like i said i thought there's some significance to the person of christ i'm pretty sure that's true um so maybe you know maybe delving into historical christianity will be the right road to get to whatever it is that i'm i'm looking for but it was heavily disappointing and i think one of the things as i dove into um western christianity i started finding certain patterns in the metaphysics that i found deeply disturbing and those those deeply disturbing patterns they concern anthropology they concern creation generally and they concern the doctrine of god and so i'll try to go as quickly as i can through these things knowing that it would take much longer to go at the depth i'd like to um but uh i'll start with uh sort of the the anthropology of it right so um obviously most folks are familiar with the doctrine of original sin and the entire idea that uh somehow we're guilty for adam's sin and we're somehow crippled and incapable of doing things that are pleasing to god and and when i really looked at augustine what what was notable to me there was that uh what you find is is what's typically referred to as this nature grace divide the idea that nature can't of its own right ever you know in itself be pleasing to god and and the context for this suddenly became uh clear to me as i was looking through and looking at the work of augustine because augustine had essentially introduced this framework of merits and demerits and and the sort of thing that became normative for the ways in which catholics understand our relationship to god and then that became you know came to four at the center of the reformation so aga essentially augustine was looking at the question of you know scripture he talks about righteousness or you know justice in the vulgate it's justity right um and so so what is it talking about right that you know this justice of god or attaining justice what does that look like and i guess then ended up developing this this concept of the order of affections or the order of loves and the idea is that whenever i engage in activity um there is a certain you know draw or a love right to a perceived good but many goods are in conflict and we can't have them at the same time so if i'm resting on the couch and i'm enjoying myself i'm at ease but then i think you know i should get up and work out i now have conflicting goods right i have a good ease and comfort but i have this other good of uh of well whatever it is but let's say of health right and those can't be had simultaneously and so when i make a choice there's a certain hierarchy of affections that begins to emerge and so the idea is that augustine presumes that every choice we make has a hierarchy of love it's reflective of a certain priority of those loves and he suggests that the just man building on the latin justicia which means that you render to egypt's due that the just man um his internal order of loves is reflective of the external order of goods in the world so augustine presumes that goods are not just subjective they're objective right god is really superior to creatures angels are superior to man man secured animals and so on and so forth down the chain uh and so he suggests that uh the order of loves of the just man mirrors the order of goods in in the cosmos and so early on when augustine is dealing with this this question and he's like okay so what do i do if i look inside and i realize i have disordered loves and early august and pre-pelagius he says well you you just will to fix it right you just change it right and then the pelagian dispute comes along and there's this entire uh dispute uh prompted well less so by pelagius um but more so by his disciple celestias but nonetheless the pelagian dispute kicks off and um and augustine's facing this question well in what sense is salvation from god or in what sense is it from grace if it's just me willing certain orders of loves and those things are pleasing to god uh what is god doing in this and so this is where augustine dealing with the pelagians introduces this framework that really suggests well you know um actually uh my order of loves is uh you know it's it's actually not in my control to make it just what i need is i need god to come in and i need him to fix that order of love so that i can do deeds that are just and that are pleasing and meritorious before god and this is where the later development of the concept of original sin comes from that there's not only an inheritance of adam's guilt but there's also an inherited distorted order of gloves that i can't fix now augustine admits like sure you can go ahead and you can choose to steal or not steal murder or not murder but insofar as it's coming from these disordered loves it's never pleasing to god this is a necessity of sin right it's always corrupt it's always sinful and so on and so you need this sort of supernatural intervention where god flips those order of gloves and suddenly it gives you uh you know internal affections from which you can do things that are pleasing to him and then to make sure that pelagius didn't have a leg stand on he suggests that even in eden before the fall even though adam could have done things that were pleasing to god it was only because of this prior grace that you know comes into the that that's there already from the outside what he calls original righteousness uh the other stuff post fall is called at least you know by the time a trent called for benign grace but in in eden it's you know this original righteousness that's there that's holding adam's order of loves together well the end result what you get there is you get uh you get a couple of different things that start to emerge right the one thing that you get is this sense that nature really doesn't have the resources in itself to ever be good right ever to be truly pleasing to god uh on its own there's always this need for this sort of supernatural intervention that adds a little something to nature in order to hold up the capacity to do good it's true pre-fall it's true post fall um and this is what's called the nature of grace divide that nature is incomplete on its own it's a capable of sort of rising up to the level it should to to produce merits you know before god um and then that brings with it also an inevitable um both anthropology and theology so on the theology side what you end up getting is you get augustine insisting that um that essentially somebody who is corrupt let's say me i'm i'll pick myself so as to not pick on anybody right i come into the world and i have guilt from adam well i'm already not owed anything from god other than justice or punishment because i'm guilty for sins um but then also because i have these distorted order of gloves even if i try to do good things i end up doing corrupt things that are sinful and so again i'm only owed uh punishment from god and so what's needed is an act of mercy on god's part but because i'm already owed punishment god doesn't have to give mercy and so this introduces a sense of arbitrariness on god's part he could show mercy he could not right sort of up to him we should be grateful if he does not surprised if he doesn't still praise him for his justice if he damns me all that sort of stuff uh and that's sort of the initiation of this type of volunteerism that happens in god where it's it's all in some sense arbitrary in the true sense of arbitrium right it's just god's choice what he wants to do um and then also on the nature side and the anthropology side it ends up creating this sense that you know any any optimistic notion of human nature is inherently flawed and it's inherently flawed because if we really understand what i am without this sort of supernatural underpinning i can't do anything that would ever be pleasing to god and so if there's you know that necessity of sin that's sitting there um and this this is the sort of way of looking at god and at man and some of the doctrines that emerged that struck me as inherently problematic uh i realized that many christians are committed to you know trying to defend god and so they want to say well you know they'll they'll go to the the you know the defense that says well sure you know i mean you know you know god is just we should be thankful that he saves anybody right and that's sort of the nice formal argument but when we really look at this question i think you know the more honest folks who are like well so if i come into the world crippled incapable of doing anything pleasing to god and god decides to uh send me to hell and i'm gonna burn forever and i had no capacity in order to undo that uh that just seems actually evil right it seems it seems unfair it seems unjust it doesn't seem good um and also i think there's you know anybody who wants to look at human nature and i say i think there's something in there right that is good even though we're all flawed and we have problems uh you know the augustinian anthropology is so pessimistic that it's really hard for folks like that to be who see uh something in humanity that that's always redeemable uh that that strikes us as problematic to read augustine in the confessions like going on and on about you know the pride of an infant that has the audacity to gnash its teeth and demand that it has its mother's breast and you know just seems too cynical of an anthropology and uh and also in terms of the cosmos itself i think myself like the other nuns it's it's very difficult to suggest that somehow there is this innate deficiency in nature right um that that that you see in augustine anyway uh this is a much much larger longer conversation but the point is that what i started to see in in god in the picture of god what i started to see in the picture man what i started seeing the picture of the cosmos it just seemed untenable to me uh it seemed to violate the intuitions that i had in terms of what i saw about you know what i saw as the sort of redemptive root in in human persons it seemed to denigrate in some ways the the goodness that i saw in creation and and the real problem with the with the theology of it was that everything that i embraced in terms of the most natural tether that i had to god was actually in the realm of of conscience right and so the entire idea that somehow i look out into the world and i see these transcendent values like beauty or i see moral values or things like that those were the things that from what where i would come down philosophically was the idea that those are the intuitions that grab hold of something transcendent a transcendent root that's not just there in the material facts and which are my clearest through lines identifying who god is and so if there are certain doctrines that are emerging that are obviously violating my moral intuitions which things like original sin did um then this seems problematic as as embracing this as somehow a true theology okay so long prelude uh to reaching the eastern church fathers um when i started reading reading the eastern church fathers i found that so much of what they considered problematic or what i considered problematic i should say in this sort of latin augustinian western christianity and i had rejected and overtly opposed i found first of all not only did they not have those doctrines they did not have the doctrine of original sin the way augustine did they didn't have the nature of grace divide the way augustine did they did not have an arbitrary deity the way augustine and i say augustine but i mean it flowers of course into scholastics and beyond into reformation post reformations class theology catholic and protestant um not only did they not have those doctrines when they did speak on those topics i saw a very different sort of theology that was there a very different uh way of looking so i saw for example that in their anthropology i thought it was fascinating that when they looked at the doctrine that man is an image of god right from genesis they were an icon of god that you really had this robust theology of image right so plato talks about two different types of image one that is sort of non-substantial like shadows right um and but then these other types of images like reflections uh have some sort of you know substantial connection so they're a substantial thing and plato of course is always interested in definitions and essential properties right square is four-sided whatever it may be uh when he's looking at the definition of what is an image something that really intrigues him is the fact that images are essentially referential right it is an image of and you need to fill in the blanket and refer to something that's not it namely its archetype and i see this you know this this comes through in some of the ancient talk of idolatry as well as images in the old testament but the church fathers really see it as significant to anthropology because if what we are is images of god they presume that essential to us as human beings is that we have a connection with our architect which is god and so the stark contrast between nature grace is actually that there is an essential unbreakable connection between me and god and it's that connection that actually makes me susceptible to participating in god and so the fall rather than being sort of this loss of some you know arbitrary gift that god may or may not give really had to do with just a distortion or a covering or a tarnishing of something that's there and redemption had to do with sort of untwisting that or unbearing it because essential the human nature was this sort of root connection with god that could never be broken or destroyed um which was such a stark contrast with the nature of grace divide um when talking about god you know the idea that god essentially wills the good of creatures such that people like atheists suggest it would be unworthy of god right it's out of step with god's character if you know if humanity falls demonic schemes take over and he doesn't redeem us right like that's inconceivable and in fact uh it's interesting when you look at certain things like the philippelli of uh origin uh which is edited by you know um uh so it's sort of a proved text of origin uh the ways in which when they look at this it's it's really sort of certain readings of scripture such as romans nine where you know where god maybe sort of just chooses moses to bless and pharaoh to destroy which is a sort of common western trend at least in certain theological circles they dismiss that as obviously false like it's not even a possible reading worth entertaining because it's so out of step with how they see god so so far from an arbitrary character there's this sort of insistence on the goodness of god that drives toward the providential care for and redemption of the creature um and that is this relentless pursuit uh that sort of always serves as a buttress against any sort of arbitrary um you know dealings with humanity of the kind that you would see in the augustinian theology and then with that uh you see this intersection between nature and man uh where it's not just the idea that we are made to participate in god that god is some way meant to be eminent within us as icons of god but that's also meant to go from us to the rest of the cosmos so far from this sort of lowly picture of nature uh as some sort of thing that's you know is on this lower level of a nature grace divide nature has again the sort of destiny of participating in god becoming a conduit or vehicle for god uh and the tether to that which is you know the icons of god man for example uh have this unseverable you know connection with it and then even in terms of redemption what you see is that redemption is really seen as the creator god of self entering the creation in order to redeem it and restore it from within because god is so relentless in that pursuit of the creature so when i started to see that picture the contrast was so stark between the systems of western scholasticism which then persisted in various forms of modern philosophy people like blindness and what i saw in the eastern fathers and that shift that took place was so monumental what i really saw there was that all of the intuitions that i had from the god of the philosophers i was kind of trying to construct you know this something that was a cohesive way of holding together my moral intuitions spiritual intuitions and all the rest um i realized that i didn't need to construct it right it was already there and these fathers and not only were they claiming that it was there it wasn't just sort of a system of philosophy according to them right it was it was it was the system of the cosmos right because it was rooted in in the very facts of the nature of the world itself and this event of the incarnation so that's i mean i i think i totally uh i would say i totally vibe with what you're saying in terms of the the difference i find it interesting that because when you were talking about this hierarchy of loves i actually just did a conference for a college here in ontario about uh about dante and his hierarchy of loves and in i feel like they're still like even in the west there was still some because in dante you get a sense in which the world you could see it in different ways like you could see the world as this this permeation of god's love that descends through different intermediaries all the way down into hell or you could see it the other way which is levels of separation depending on how your loves are oriented so it seems like it's there's still possibility within within even the at least the western storytelling to find versions of something which is more like uh the notion of god's love which actually fills up the world and is you know like the idea that like san fran's notion that that the fire in hell is god's love basically you know that it's actually the this fullness of reality um and so anyways i just thought of that because i just did a conference on that on this idea of like of of the the how the goods fit into each other in dante's scheme let's say yeah well i do think you're right when you look at also i mean another place you could look as bonaventure right so um you know so you do see especially i think in franciscan strands especially but not exclusively in the franciscans i think you do see these remnants of this sort of cascading divinity which is really i think the picture that's there where when you look at the eastern fathers and you look at the idea of what the cosmos untainted you know unfallen is supposed to be and then what is supposed to become again through redemption what you really do see is this sort of uh you know this trinitarian sort of uh sharing of divinity right in the sense that you have the father who has you know the divine nature and gives it to the sun by beginning in the spirit by spiration and then that these are supposed to then cascade down into the hierarchies of angels right you know that you know the nine the nine hierarchies that you see there where there are higher angels and lower angels and some have a greater capacity for god than others and it sort of cascades down into these which then cascades into the lower order of angels and then they're ministering spirits who are supposed to in some ways cascade administered to us as human beings but human beings being this sort of hybrid of spirituality and organism who have within us the material of the cosmos is supposed to then cascade from us to lower things you know such as animals and plants and all things are supposed to participate um to whatever degree they're they're able right and this is where i think an analogy i always like to use is to think in terms of you know the sort of creative genius of a musician like um let's say you know we'll just use bach as shorthand uh and if we had bach here and we wanted to show forth his genius and let an instrument participate in it if we handed him a triangle right he he can't do too much with that right i'm sure he could do things that would impress us more than i could do all that but it's very limited it's inherently very limited in its capacity yes the nature of the object itself yeah yeah and whereas we give him a piano that's a totally different story yeah but the triangle can participate in the good fully right to the extent that it can like a rock can participate in the good fully to the extent that it can actually it can't participate more in god without actually abandoning its own nature like it has to in order to preserve its identity it has to be at its level let's say yes and yet then if we place it in the context of an orchestra it has a greater share in it right in the sense that now the triangle even though it's it's still bind by its inherent limitations it's sort of wrapped up in this larger participation of an orchestra itself and that's really what you see there when you're talking about this cascading divinity all things participating in god to the extent their nature allows it and yet because there is this broader participation in the whole of the cosmic organism even the things that are lower and have limited capacities like rocks end up participating in greater degrees than they could on their own so i think you see that that's that's clearly the picture of the eastern church fathers and the way they see the cosmos and i think you're right to see people groping toward that or trying to retain that in some ways in various aspects of the latin west but i think this goes to another area that struck me as critical in terms of difference between east and west and this has to do with the topics of divine simplicity and the essence energies distinction that you end up seeing there so in the latin west one of the critical moments that happens in augustine's own thinking is this idea that god is a super uh super simple essence right is the term that he ends up using um and this is largely due to his the influence of paganism now i'm not doing that dirty trick where you say like oh it's platonism so it's bad uh actually big fan plato big fan uh a lot of truth there uh big fan uh and and i think there's a lot of resonance in you know between plato and the eastern church fathers and things like that yeah um but augustine probably had a little too much fondness for plato i believe the quote went something like i am convinced i will find nothing in the writings of the plaintiffs that conflict with holy scripture probably is a tad too optimistic right there but um but nonetheless this idea that you know working within a certain understanding of platonism the the framework augustine ends up adopting is that really what you have is you have the forms right these archetypes that are the models for uh for material instances right so you have the archetypal square of four-sidedness equal length and then you have instances of square and the instances are always related to materiality right and that's where you get definite size and you get color and you can also have imperfections and number and all that sort of stuff um and uh and yet the forms transcend all of that and so they transcend those sorts of accidental properties but then for augustine you know god is you know the good or the form of the good that transcends even those other forms and so there's a certain simplicity that emerges there that's even above that of the forms because a square for example has foresight in this equal length it's complex right so it's it's essential but it's not simple right and god is beyond even that well that creates all sorts of challenges that basically set the tone for most of what the scholastics are going back and forth about it says all sorts of challenges uh for scholastic theology um precisely because when you start to ask these questions like well i mean there's obvious ones like the trinity if you have super simple essence how do you have several persons but even uh issues like divine knowledge right if god doesn't have accidental properties because accidental properties like you know color or size these shifting properties are properties of matter and god is above all that um and god can know that i'm you know waving my hand right now isn't that a shifting property in god or if i make a free choice and my choice could be otherwise doesn't mean that's that's a property in god that could be otherwise and so how do you have god have knowledge of the world or how do you have god make free choices himself if three choices are choices that could have been otherwise and all these sorts of things that unfold in scholastic thought that become major problems for how to embrace this sort of form of uh you know this form of theology or you know the plagueism the simplicity doctrine um while still affirming the things of christianity uh and and one of the things that you begin to see is one of the standard solutions in terms of how they deal with this is basically internal relations versus external relations uh and so the trinity is an internal relation the super simple essence relating to itself as father and in this sense it produces a relation also an identity not only his father but also son and the love between those and things like that so it tries to make the trinity not an additional property or something like that but a relational sort of phenomena out of sort of the essence self-relating and then you have external relations where you know god is the first cause affects the material world in certain way and the effects are external relations of god that in some ways sort of solve this problem and that's how they try to do it incidentally personally i think most of these solutions don't actually work in solving this problem but nonetheless they they do their darndest to make sure that they they they try to make them work but i think the big challenge that you see is because of the doctrine of simplicity of that particular form of the doctrine of simplicity god is never really eminent uh in creation in the way it would be in the eastern fathers so grace for example officially according to catholic church right this this thing it's it's created right it is created grace and why is it created well because it's an effect right when you're talking about the presence of god he's present via the effect so my order of love shifts because of convenient grace and now i have an order of loves from which i can if i freely cooperate you know produce deeds that are meritorious before god but that's not in in any way a part of god in me right this is god is in me via the effect that has been brought upon me and that's why grace is ultimately created because it's all creature over here whereas for the eastern fathers yes they talk about divine simplicity um but when you look at their talk of divine simplicity there's all sorts of ways in which it's very different than that so um gregory misses very clear no means that yes the divine essence is simple right whatever god is is one thing this you know the divine nature is simple but he says you know but the persons aren't right there's three of them and then you see people like basil caesarea saying well the essence is one but the energies that exude from it and you know those are you know how many they're they're innumerable yeah and so they start to draw these sorts of distinctions um and and the reason this is critical is um because when you look at the i'm sure you know this about the essence energies but rather than presuming that all your you know listeners do um i mean the basic concept of this essence energy's distinction is uh you know the term energy emerges from aristotle right and it initially emerges in the context of the unmoved mover and refers to a certain type of activity right so aristotle being convinced that all this mutated changing stuff in our world has to stand upon something that's unchanging right that doesn't mutate he had to draw develop a term that refers to that type of perfect non-mutated activity that his god would do and so he draws the distinction between kinesis which is progressive incomplete you know changing motion like building a house you know it goes through stages versus complete or perfect activity like seeing every time i look at you it's complete in that moment um and then the alexandrian jews thought this was really useful way of talking about god and his activity and so they start to embrace this but unlike aristotle who had said that god's essence is energia right he is just nothing but pure you know perfect activity um the alexandria jews drew a distinction between god's face and his back drawing from the story of moses right show me your glory and he says i'll show you my face i can't show you my face i might see my face and lip but i'll show you my back um which became interpreted at least in people like philo of alexandria like the distinction between god's essence who he is in himself and the energies those aspects that exude from god and come down to us and convey who he is and then that distinction plays its way out in a couple of different ways in alexandria judaism there was also this notion of transference where the operative powers that express a nature in some ways communicable so the favorite metaphor or the favorite analogy for the church fathers is always fire and metal right they stick metal and fire and then it starts to glow and burn and you remove it and now it has the energies right or the energy of fire in it of heating and lighting it's still metal right but something of the nature of fire has been communicated to it and that became the way of explaining things like demoniacs how are how are demoniacs have secret knowledge or superhuman strength or whatever it is they're participating they're energized by those things right they're participating in the foreign nature the energies of that foreign nature um and it also became how they explain prophets right energized by you know god or or by the holy angels and second maccabees yeah holy fields that energies the maccabees for war and so and that ends up in the new testament and then in the church fathers it's critical because they understand this is part of how you have two natures of christ that don't get confused and yet they commune with each other right the one energizing the other um and it also became critical to their understanding of us and what is it that we're doing in christianity what is it that we hope for uh participating in the nature of god um now the reason but there's a way it's important to specify that the energies of god are god like it yes they're not seen as a lower even though there's a distinction they're not seen as a lower form of divinity or as some kind of yeah right and this is the critical point this is where i was going with this because because there's a tendency to think in very binary terms you know in the western context of there's the divine nature and then there's creatures and what you get is a much more complex ontology when you're talking about the eastern church fathers yeah there's the divine nature there's the the who possesses the the subjects that have it and give it stasis um and then there's also these divine energies that exude from it and what's fascinating is these are called you know by people like maximus the confessor right these are the works of god that precede creation well if they precede creation then they're not creatures and then you have this strange language like they're the things around god that are god they're the processions they're the energies and so you get all these sort of strange the strange foreign language to us that's there in people like pseudo-dionysius and the kappa notions and yet as you pointed out everything about that ontology says these energies are god and so just like on the one hand you know you don't get to peer into my mind as it is but you do encounter these things that exude from it right the energy says i'm speaking right now these are activities or operations in my mind and they are part of me right and they are expressions of that mind they are punctuated finite particular expressions of the nature of my mind and so in the same way the divine energies are that and the reason that's critical is because if if the energies themselves can be participated in by creatures right an image of god or an image in general an image is capable of participating in the attributes of that which it images right it's shape it's color things like that we are images of god and so can participate in god's attributes which of the eastern church fathers refer to the energies not to the divine nature um then what that means is those parts of god which is one of the words maximus the confessor uses right can be resident in you and in me and in a relic and in an icon right and in nature you know and in some ways necessarily so because it's that which makes it exist right right that that does make it kind of important yeah but but this is where there that that divide right there even though it's obviously it's a lot of metaphysics that i just went through that divide is critical so that even though you might find in the west this sort of hierarchy and this notion of participation in this memory of a certain theology that's essentially christian the very fact that grace is created in the latin west and it's primarily just an effect on the creature as opposed to in the east where it actually is god imminently present in the creature it's part of god in the creature that is such a you know a critical distinction in terms of ontology that has uh going back to something you mentioned before re-mythologizing the world and this is this is a critical feature of if you're going to talk about a mythologized world and talking about uh the sort of spiritual dimensions of nature like i talked about with the nuns or spiritual dimensions of you or me and the spiritual potential of the cosmos itself um this is where that sort of thing that you find in the eastern fathers i think is so critical to uh to the to seeing how different the world view really is even though it sounds very similar uh on many points and then i think in many ways it also comes let's say comes at a at a point where let's say the the strong dualities of modernity are kind of breaking down and we can see already the the problem of the problem of this created grace problem or the creature as outside god you know is is the problem of a kind of radical duality even though it's maybe not formulated that way explicitly at the highest level it ends up playing out that way where you have you know god above and then all these things that are created out there and there's an arbitrary relationship of will between god and and the world whereas you know this this kind of way of mechanically describing also the the phenomena in reality is it's breaking down it doesn't doesn't hold like it doesn't even hold in terms of cognitive science and in terms of of of the quantum physics and these new these kind of limits of science that that people are reaching it just it doesn't hold and you need you know the notion of of rather the inevitability of meaning is something that i talk about a lot like the inevitability of of identity and the inevitability of hierarchies of of identity for the world to actually exist is becoming more and more apparent um and what let's say the ontology they say maximus proposes for us it gives us a very powerful solution to avoid duality to really have true non-duality you know how people love non-duality like stem semi-access actually offers us a true non-duality which is not a collapse into a monad but rather this this like like you said it's like this procession of of energies this procession of grace that comes down from god and brings everything back into god doesn't deny the multiplicity of existence but ultimately makes everything participate in this his hierarchy of meaning his hierarchy of purposes maybe purpose is a better word even than meaning like it's all everything that exists has a ultimate purpose and that ultimate purpose is actually god to the extent to which it can embed it into all these others like a symphony because the way you've portrayed it as a symphony is much better way to to understand it like it's all playing together like to to kind of become the let's say the creation is becoming the lover of god you could say in a way that is fully unity like bringing it together into into him as uh in a mysterious union you could say yeah yeah in terms of i mean in terms of the sort of breaking down of the modern framework the book um i just signed a contract with cambridge university press for my next book um which is called the inevitability of liveness and uh and it's because i really do when i look at western you know not just christianity but western philosophy to whatever extent it's an inheritor of of you know the scholastic discussion that preceded it which i really think it is i mean i think when you look at rationalists and even people like jakarta uh like people like lives people like descartes there really is uh you know the conversation is still you know the tone of it is still set by the scholastic discussions that proceeded and the augustinian roots of those discussions and so on and there's a real sense in which i think liven is a system of thought as repugnant as so many people find it to be uh there's a sense in which i don't know that there's an escape hatch if you're going to embrace the western premises concerning divine simplicity and uh and and the sort of theology that's there and that's so much of what that book is is going to be about is about sort of rudeness that lightning life is has he doesn't emerge just sort of ex nilo right you know out of nothing he's he really is uh an expert in the scholastic thinking and systems that preceded him and of his own day and he's a systematizer of them is explicit about this that he's a systematizer of them and his entire you know theodicy and the idea of you know ours being the best possible world and all that and proceeding from these divine decrees of god assessing all the possible analytic you know outcomes that are there and choosing the best and so i think there's a sense in which there's no obvious escape hatch from liveness if you're going to accept the western premises but do you think that do you think that some of the like multiverse type discussion and the infinite universe type discussion is a way that materialists are trying to deal with this problem the idea that everything that exists can exist like that that you know all possibilities actually physically exist somewhere in a vast infinite universe that kind of that kind of i think it's nonsense but it's like it seems like it's people trying to grope with this problem like the problem of existence itself you could say yeah well i mean i do think i do well i agree with you that i think it's nonsense uh but and i do think there probably is some of that but the problem the problem you inevitably run into is you know at least with a multiverse theory at least when it's used as a way to try to explain existence itself right it always runs into the problem that uh everything about the multiverse theory requires the prior features of mathematics and the features of mathematics are things that as far as we can tell are only accessible to and produced by and you know entangled with you know mind and so you still don't sort of escape this sort of uh mental phenomena and i do i toy with this whenever i'm talking about ways that people try to escape liveness is that they'll they'll either go to the absurd and they'll just choose randomness and for some reason randomness is better than picking them this is incredibly rationalistic you know rigid system or they'll end up you know just trying to multiply you know the number of possibilities that are there similarly the multiverse does but there's something that's inescapable about it once you've embraced sort of rationalist framework and that's where i really do think the only way to to truly escape it is to avoid the type of um rigid ontologies and dichotomies that are there in the first place and that's where you really do need the sorts of things that you find in people like maximus and in you know the eastern church fathers which really do find an alternative you know provide a very real alternative way of looking at the cosmos um and at oncology and the ways in which uh god and world interact i really do think that's that's the only real escape hatch i don't think there's i don't think there's another right look i we've been going for a while i think that's a good way to end is like there is no other escape hatch so listen nathan this was a really wonderful discussion i i really appreciate it and we'll definitely i'll definitely be keeping tabs on your upcoming projects and once you are allowed to talk about your projects you know it would be nice to to have you back into because one of the things i'd like to to to help people think of is how it is it that artists today especially artists that are christian how can they create in this world like how is it that they create something that is both connected to the world in which they live but is pointing towards the good and the true um you know and and the beautiful and so that'll be our next conversation if if you if you're okay with that oh
