how's it going guys in this video I'm going to be showing you how I create my signature shorts on YouTube and I'm talking about my coding shorts how I do that from scratch so I'll be showing you how you can do that so you can start creating your very own coding shorts now the first thing I want to mention is that I do everything on my MacBook and I'm sure the process can be very similar on Windows but I can only show you how I do this on Mac so to get started I'm going to close this window because now we see what a short usually looks like and the first thing we're going to do is open up pycharm and I use pycharm when I create all my shorts because it has some very nice visual features and at the moment it's just a normal code editor in horizontal mode but as you might have guessed it when I create a short I like to drag this and make it as vertical as possible and these are not random Dimensions I actually went over and created a frame once so that I could see exactly the dimensions for that short so right now we have have a window here that's 180 by 1920 and those are the dimensions I use for my YouTube shorts so I do something very rustic and now I'm just going to open up pycharm and usually I would drag it around here and maybe put it around there so it's roughly the right ratio but I mostly use pycharm for the view feature if you go to view and go under appearance you can enter something called distraction free mode and that makes the code editor super clean without all of that clutter now if I want to run code all I have to do is hold command plus r and it will run the code at the bottom so now you can see how it's starting to look more like a short something you can also do is delete that and delete that and while you're explaining something you just hold command Z and you can insert the code and explain it as you are pasting it then you can say okay next we're going to create a print statement and that's going to look like that so now you know that with VAR equals you have this special syntax and as you might have noticed I have my Watermark at the top because a lot of people love to steal these shorts and if it wasn't for the YouTube copyright system a lot of people would get away with that but even if they do get away with that it's hard to get away with not seeing this Watermark so if you make some YouTube shorts and you don't want people stealing it without putting any effort into stealing it just add a watermark it's okay to copy Concepts it's just not okay to copy and paste videos exactly the way they are and Rebrand it with your own name so if you want to teach this concept fine type it out yourself but just don't download the video and re-upload it anyway so now we have this window here but how do I record this well on Mac we have something called QuickTime Player and this is the recording software I use for all of my recordings so first I would open that then I would right click and I'll tap on new screen recording and here you have a few options you can record the entire screen or you can record a section and as you can see I have my section here that's already prepared for shorts and I would usually do something like this it's already set to a ratio that I use all the time so what I showed you earlier might not really matter but this ratio is set up by default for me since it's what I always use and to record I just tap on record and then I start doing my thing and I would even move the window a bit down here now depending on how complex the code of the short is I might increase the font size or decrease the font size so it really depends on what I'm doing but usually I would try to increase it as much as possible because when you have to read code on a small device it's just a lot more convenient that the code is actually of a decent size then I would run the code and say okay here's your result blah blah blah and I would stop the recording I would tap on stop here and then I would have this brute recording and this is before processing so I still need to edit the footage because usually I make a lot of mistakes even if it's 50 seconds I usually cut maybe 10 or 12 times minimum so right now we have this I'll save it as a file or actually it's already saved here and we can call it short then the next step is to edit it so I go to iMovie which is a free movie editing software provided by Mac you're going to have to use something different on Windows I'm not a Windows user so I can't help you with that but this is the software I use and I just drag my short here and then I start doing my editing so I'd say okay I need to edit this section out so I'll delete that remove that need to edit this section out as well move that delete that of course I would listen to the audio before doing all of this so now we can pretend that we actually edited the short and this is what we have left but there is one problem and that is that if we render it like this it's not going to render as a short it's actually going to have this black background and YouTube is not going to recognize that as a short so in iMovie there's actually a workaround so you're going to have to highlight all of the clips and then rotate them so now we have a horizontal video although the user of course is not going to have this as a final product so let's export this so I can show you the final step for my short I'll give it some crazy title such as this is my short and I would save it to my desktop and this is already getting a bit cluttered that's just how I do it I should think of a better system that maybe have an output folder but this is what I have so far and once it has finished rendering I'm going to have this as a product a sideways video of my final short and I can actually close iMovie at the moment and I can close pycharm so I can show you that this is what I have and maybe put the volume down so and that is a fully functioning short horizontally but of course that's not what we want so once again on Mac you can hold shift command plus r for right rotate and it's going to turn it back to its vertical position then when you try to exit out of it you can save it as the final product so final products short and then it's going to render it as a short in a vertical position now I can actually remove the other two video files because I won't be using that and at the end of this crazy process we're going to end up with this short over here so in total this can take anywhere between 5 and 15 minutes depending on the complexity of the shot then I just upload this to YouTube because once you upload a video in vertical format it's going to recognize that as a short and that's the entire process that I go through when I have to create shorts on YouTube and then of course you can put these on Tick Tock or even on Instagram it's just good that you create your own shorts I know a lot of you out there are probably very talented when it comes to sharing information but just haven't had the opportunity yet to actually start doing it there probably will be someone out there that will appreciate your explanation since we all explain things in different ways I mean when I started my Channel I didn't go in with the mentality that there are a million python videos I just went in with the mentality that I have a different way of teaching and some people are going to prefer some styles of teaching over others so I highly encourage you not to be discouraged by all the videos that are already out there on YouTube because everyone has their own way of teaching and sometimes times you can easily gain an audience based on your way of teaching but anyways guys I hope you found this video interesting if you do create some shorts do let me know in the comment section down below I would love to see them but as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
