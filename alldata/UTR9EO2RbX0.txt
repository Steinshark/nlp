unless you've spent your whole life playing it safe and you've never tried anything risky odds are you've got some regrets in your past it could be not trying hard enough in a relationship or not fighting harder to get that job you really wanted or maybe it's passing on that once in a-lifetime investment opportunity that would have made you rich crypto obviously right now getting crushed I've definitely got a few life regrets of my own but this channel is all about film making and when it comes to film making regrets there's one in particular that stands Head and Shoulders Above the Rest this is the one that even after after more than 10 years working as a professional DP and director still bothers me and if there's any way for me to help you not make this same mistake yourself then I will have done my job with this channel my work is done here so in this video I'm going to get into what my biggest regret as a filmmaker is and then share the three most painful examples of how it held me back and then at the end I'll give you my best advice on how to avoid making the same mistake yourself so that you don't have to look back at your career 10 years later and wonder what could have [Music] been right off the bat for anyone following along these last couple months while I was shooting up north in the Arctic you're probably going to be happy to see that I'm finally back home with better lighting and audio not to mention that I was able to get my first haircut in 120 days so thank you for putting up with my general scruffiness and the rough production quality for the last couple of months but like I keep saying I'm a working DP and not a full-time YouTuber so it's kind of the way it has to go if I'm going to keep putting out these videos every week while still doing my job luckily I've got nothing on the books until mid January though so for a little while anyways I'm happy to be filming these videos back in a more controlled environment and wearing clean clothes so thank you and now let's get right into it I'm not going to beat around the bush here and do the whole YouTuber thing of dragging out the suspense until the very end of the video but before I tell you what my biggest regret is and how to avoid it yourself I just want to take a second and give you a little bit of context on how I got to where I am shooting documentaries for some of the biggest outlets in the world like I didn't go to film school and I never studied film or photography formally I also wasn't some sort of child prodigy who just picked up a camera and had success right away I was actually in my late 20s by the time I got my first paying assignment I had a ton of different jobs from professional tree planter to call center salesman to English teacher in South Korea so it's not like I was born knowing what I wanted to do with my life so why am I telling you this I guess my point is by the time I fully committed to my dream of being a full-time photographer and filmmaker I'd already let a lot of time slip by that I could never get back now it wasn't like I wasted those years working a dead end job or playing video games in my mom's basement or something like that because I'd mostly spent that time traveling the world and experiencing as many different things as I could from crewing on sailboats in the Indian Ocean to picking pretty much every kind of fruit on the planet on farms in Australia and New Zealand but even though I wouldn't trade those experiences for anything once I figured out what I actually wanted to be a documentary photographer and filmmaker I'd wasted a lot of time so what does that mean exactly well basically instead of just getting out there and dedicating myself to practicing and getting better every day I convinced myself that it was better to wait until the situation was perfect before really going for it like somehow if I just waited long enough all the stars would align and it would be easy for me to get what I wanted and I didn't just do this when starting out in photography I did it again when I was transitioning into documentary production and then again before starting this YouTube channel and I'm willing to bet that a lot of people out there are doing doing the same thing right now which is what this video is all about the first time I made this mistake I was living in South Korea and working as an English teacher when I stumbled on the movie War photographer one night and in an instant realized I wanted to quit teaching to be a documentary photographer now I already had an okay camera I think it was a Nikon d80 and I was living in Asia which was obviously full of Amazing Stories to document but for some reason I was hesitant to just get out there and start shooting I mean I say for some reason but the reason is actually pretty obvious it's because it was hard and I wanted to believe that I could make make it Easy by just waiting for the situation to be perfect so I enrolled in a one-on-one workshop with one of my favorite photographers and told myself that once I wrapped my contract and finished the workshop then I'd really start now don't get me wrong the workshop was amazing and I learned a ton I owe a lot of my professional success to that Workshop but when I started it I really didn't have much of a documentary portfolio to speak of because instead of getting out into the streets of soul and shooting every day after work I'd waited because I thought it would be easier later spoiler alert it wasn't easy year later it was just as hard except instead of having 8 months of practice under my belt from day one of the workshop I'd shot maybe 15 days over two half-hearted project attempts and looking back South Korea would have been an amazing place to shoot in it's a regret that might not have stung quite so much if I'd never made it again but sadly I didn't learn after that Workshop I moved to Cambodia and I went all in on photography I shot every day like it was my job for 2 years until I caught my first lucky break and started getting paid assignments with first the New York Times and then other International newspapers there's a lot more to the story than that but I've already told this story on the channel before so I'll just say I managed to build up a decent little documentary career for myself as a photographer but after a couple of years of things going well I started to get interested in branching out from Stills into documentary production and again I did the same thing instead of just switching my camera into video mode and getting started I spent hours combing the internet for guides on how to become a better filmmaker and the perfect cinema camera to buy I'm not saying I did nothing because I did shoot a few small things and I was still working full-time as a photographer but it was about 2 years from the time I had the idea to become a filmmaker to the time I actually went for it I told myself all the same lies it's going to be easier when you get a better camera and you just need to move to a bigger Market because Cambodia is too small to really get good jobs but at the end of the day it was really the same as before I wanted it to be easy when what I really needed to do was just start I guess you're seeing the pattern now eventually I made the move from Cambodia to Mexico and I started shooting more and more video until I caught another lucky break and got into professional documentary production for real starting with a National Geographic shoot on heroin production I've also already told this story a bunch of time so I'll just keep it short and say that again I regretted waiting so long just to take action because I would have been so much further ahead if I just gotten going in Cambodia instead of waiting so by this point you think I'd have learned my lesson except that I did exactly the same thing when I started this YouTube [Music] channel now i' been having a lot of success in the film making business and I'd managed to get myself onto big shoots for Netflix and National Geographic and people like that but at the same time I was noticing the rise of Photography and film making channels on YouTube and I kind of started to wonder what would happen if I gave it a shot myself this was in the early days when Peter McKinnon was still a small Channel and Matty hioa still called himself travel Fields talking about like 2016 2017 when the film making YouTube world was wide open and there was a ton of interest in that space with not that many people with professional experience teaching their skills and I liked teaching I was watching more YouTube than regular TV and I had all the gear and Technical knowledge I needed so what did I do well you probably know what I'm going to say but instead of just giving it a go I sat back and waited Flash Forward 5 years or so to when I actually started making weekly videos and do you think YouTube got easier during that time no chance there were way more people talking about film making the competition was way higher and it was a lot harder just to make a video about frame rates and blow up overnight so what's the takeaway here well the simple version is that there is no perfect time to get started on the things you're passionate about and no amount of waiting is going to make things easier you're not going to be a better filmmaker by waiting to buy a new camera and you're definitely not going to tell better stories by watching more tutorials or reading more articles in this business the only thing that matters is action action plus dedication over a long period of time and the best way to get to where you want to go is to start right now if you you ever heard the saying the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now it's exactly the same thing for film making or photography or really any other creative thing these days with the amount of educational content coming out online and the insane cycle of continuously improving new tech it's even easier to think that if you just research enough or buy enough gear suddenly you'll reach some sort of perfect time we're getting started is going to be easy and you'll finally get out there and shoot your first short film [Music] well take it from me and my repeated mistakes over the last 15 years that is not the way to get what you want the only thing that works is doing and doing consistently over time and I really doubt that's ever going to change regardless of how good AI gets and how big the YouTube community grows so no matter what you're trying to do don't wait until you have the same regrets that I do obviously I got there in the end but how much more of an impact would this channel have had if I'd started in 2016 when I'd first had the idea probably a ton when I think back on how open things were it kind of makes me sick to think of all the opportunities I missed out by waiting so please please don't be like me if you want to be a photographer go shoot with whatever you have instead of waiting for that new A7 whatever it's not going to make your life easier if you want to film documentaries don't think that it's suddenly going to be a walk in the park if you just move to New York or buy an fx6 it's not if you're thinking about starting a YouTube channel to promote your work or share your knowledge it's not going to get any less saturated by waiting until next year when all your ducks are in a row whatever you're going after wherever you are now go out and start right now the bottom line is that action gets results and nothing else does so there we go my biggest professional regret that still bothers me after all these years if I could go back in time and yell at my younger self to stop waiting and just go I would but since I can't the next best thing to do is yell at all of you instead so that hopefully you save yourself the same heartache if you want a bit help I made a free long-term planning guide that will help you come up with a long-term strategy uh and that's linked for free in the description but even though I think it's pretty solid advice even that won't change the fact that doing is the only thing that matters to get the results you want don't wait take action now or you'll look back in 10 years and regret it see [Music]
