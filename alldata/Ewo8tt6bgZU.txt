500 Hertz is this real when it comes to competition or even just the satisfaction of crushing Bots we've demonstrated Beyond reasonable doubt that more is better when it comes to monitor refresh rates we've got more than ever the aw 2524 from Alienware is the first 500 Hertz monitor to hit our lab and it is absolutely incredible sit up straight Gamers because it's ergonomic color accurate and boasts speed that's at the edge of human visual perception finally I can go from 2.78 milliseconds in latency to only two all the Unstoppable no one will see me coming with 0.78 milliseconds of time eliminated from my leg chain at last every every Farm except for one small problem we also demonstrated Beyond reasonable doubt that while 360 Hertz is technically better than 240 hertz the difference is kind of like going from a Supercar to an even more super car and making matters worse ultra high refresh rate monitors like this one are expensive do you even need one of these when there are less costly contenders that might actually even deliver a better gaming experience do you even need this message from our sponsor build Redux take the hassle out of building your own gaming PC with simple to navigate customization options and competitive pricing compared to building a PC yourself build Redux will help you dominate your favorite games with the perfect PC for you check them out at the link below I want to make this clear pun intended the aw 2524h is amazing it's 24.5 inches 1080p so the Esports special but it's IPS with accurate coverage of 99 of the srgb color gamut boasts 0.5 milliseconds greater grade pixel response times and has an Nvidia g-sync module on top of Yes you heard me right a 500 freaking Hertz panel I cannot believe the lab wouldn't let me play with this ahead of time we were testing it this is smooth frog like the UFO test on blurbusters it's a great way of evaluating the Motion Performance of a monitor or a television but unlike the UFO test it runs locally on the machine meaning that we can run this thing at 500 frames per second which is exactly where we land after the recommended 20 Hertz Factory overclock it's actually 480 Hertz out of the box I never thought I would live to see an IPS panel that performs like this I'm definitely seeing a little bit of blur along the back of my White Frog here but looking at these numbers I honestly I'm kind of Blown Away I've reviewed the script for this already so I know that overall we're not hyper bullish on this display but I guess I'm gonna have to see the competition because this looks really good to me even more remarkable is that there's no compromise with respect to vibrancy or viewing angles I mean it's IPS it looks fantastic I don't know what to tell you man I am damn impressed by this I haven't even moved a mouse yet oh wow hold on one second one second oh my God great okay sure oh yeah look if you're spending money on your chair when you don't already have the best computer you're doing it wrong but feel free to spend money on lttstore.com okay FPS underscore Max 1000 like I don't know hey there we go boys 600 FPS let's go this game is running at up to 900 frames per second this feels like looking through a window into the real world it's so smooth look at that clarity as I'm panning around though you know normally particularly on things like these power lines um I usually look to darks or high contrast objects against the skyline like you'll see that you'll see that blur or ghosting but man that is clear like you could you can read the text Graham here did she bought gray in there like what hold on hold on let's get right in here oh what even if we can't run at the same FPS I want to play something that has a bit of a longer time to kill because that's what we found where the biggest benefit of high refresh rate and high FPS for that matter comes in when you are tracking a moving Target that is changing direction it's not just about the smoothness of the animation and the clarity though those things don't hurt something to note is you do need to use DisplayPort in order to hit that 500 Hertz even though it's 1080p that's still a freaking lot of bandwidth and the HDMI port on this thing is only HDMI 2.0 so you're going to be locked at 240 hertz if you stick with HDMI I mean realistically you're not spending this kind of money on a monitor and then not hooking up a DisplayPort cable to like a top tier graphics card like it that would be gross misallocation of funds button just making sure you know why do I have a bazooka what game mode is this probably like Fiesta or something what the hell is Fiesta this is where you get random weapons you're playing on medium how many frames are you getting I don't know like 350 FPS no okay hold on a second no I need to leave this game and just play a different one because like I the whole point of this was I wanted to like get in gunfights with people I get it Brandon our expert tells us that while it is definitely not as much of a benefit as outputting a higher this is the same stupid thing why is this oh shoot I just sat on the power button oh my God damn it well it doesn't make you a better player but the monitor though right but the monitor yes yes hold on it's so fast got him look at this guy he's hanging from the door this is how you know it's a really good display when all he does is just end up playing Halo the whole time okay this thing is pretty amazing just like tracking moving objects like this like again I don't compensate for spread so I suck but if you look back that Crosshair was on him like ah I love this thing okay whoops sorry now seems like as good a time as I need to point out that this display supports g-sync what's cool about that is if we're running variable refresh rate there is technically a latency benefit to having this 500 Hertz display even if our game is not managing to hit 500 frames per second and Halo infinite did not we did at best around 350. that benefit is very so small there's just one problem this 240 hertz OLED from LG is running at less than half the refresh rate but looks clearer to just about everyone we showed it to the vibes from this one feel a little better I'm going to say this one this I think has the best motion tracking it's a different kind of clarity there is far far less blur behind our frogs here but what I'm actually noticing is that relatively speaking the text is less visible so these finer objects are still very legible but not quite the same I can definitely see why people like this image more though but if you look at readability of text it's not even close part of it is probably the resolution this is a 1440p display so these elements are smaller but I should be able to compensate by just getting closer and I can that could just as easily be 255 or 256 whereas here I can clearly see that is 255. ghosting on the back of basically every leg of the Frog it's just much more noticeable on the white guy whereas that ghosting is just gone on the OLED however you can also almost see the the judder on the OLED yeah so there's a there's a doubling of the image even if it's not blurry whatever our subjective opinions might be there's no doubt that when captured in a still frame the clarity of the LG OLED is higher and this is where things get a little technical while the Alienware display might refresh at lightning speed processing the data needed to Output a new frame once every two milliseconds the individual pixels that make up the panel here they still need a moment to catch up right I mean don't get me wrong it looks incredible and in most cases it's almost imperceptible as we saw when I was playing actual games but when we compare that to the micro second response times of an OLED I mean take a look at this frog capture it might be hard to see through our camera but in person the white frog has clear ghosting as it slides across our IPS panel whereas on the OLED it is simply not there kind of like how you can see our behind the scenes content on floatplane.com but on Utah but on YouTube it's simply not there get subscribed so you can meet the team and check out how we shoot our merge photos you can see a great example of why image Clarity matters in addition to having a high refresh rate when you look at this video we did on a DIY 480 Hertz monitor like five years ago sure we've got the most up-to-date frame being streamed to us through the scalar but the actual image was a blurry mess anytime it was in motion for the sake of fairness we tried all the different response time settings that are available on the Alienware monitor it has four fast super fast extreme and Esports extreme and while Esports extreme is 0.2 milliseconds faster than fast based on our testing the amount of overshoot and therefore visual anomalies that are introduced just is not worth it at all especially for such a tiny Improvement can you tell the difference between 2.4 and 2.2 milliseconds I know I can't but back to our original question what about 2.78 versus 2 milliseconds that's the difference between a 360 Hertz Monitor and a 500 Hertz one okay here's the thing as we make our displays refresh faster and faster we get these shorter frame times meaning more frames displayed over the same period of time I mean I was an early advocate for the benefits of high refresh rate gaming the jump from 60 hertz at 16.67 milliseconds per frame up to 120 hertz at only 8.33 milliseconds per frame that was huge and just about everyone in their grand Pappy can feel the difference even when you're simply browsing the web or chilling on the desktop but as we've shown in the past the faster you go the Lesser rare of a difference you are bound to notice and the math for why that is is pretty simple even if we were to take that 120 hertz and double our refresh rate again look at that we cut our benefit in half and by the time we land at 360 each frame is on the display for at most 2.78 milliseconds back then to Dell alienware's own marketing where they say that 500 Hertz is reaching speed that's at the edge of human visual perception well I think they kind of hit the nail on their own head here can anyone tell even now we brought in zawi's new flagship the 360 Hertz TN gaming display the xl2566k to find out oh look at that it appeared I can't really feel the difference I can't recognize a different I don't think I could really tell which one's a 500 Hertz Monitor and which one's a 360. I helped set up this test I know this one's 500. I ca I literally cannot see any difference at all in terms of like frame times between these two I'm surprised how bright this is with black frame insertion actually that looks really good for a TN oh well yeah as soon as you go until you're anywhere other than right in front of it okay okay okay uh Andrew you should yeah yeah shoot it shoot it straight on okay shoot its good side which is Dot from the side while you get the crispness that's associated with black frame insertion or backlight strobing and you can you can really see that on some of these Boulder lines because these pixels are simply not switching as fast as on the Dell Alienware as far as I can tell you're also getting a nice crisp ghost of an image on every fine line every single color while I don't see a blur behind the object I see a clear shadow of the object behind it and that's on every color transition not just on the super high contrast ones like I'm I'm really noticing especially on these color circles yeah we literally were just talking about this there's a name for this artifact that you see I forget the name of it though anyway the point is especially on this red one I'm actually seeing an overshoot and I'm seeing an after image yeah so that's inherent with LCD BFI because the backlight can't turn in in sync with their scanner at every line so you're always going to have that issue and people are saying they prefer this well this test is meant for it to look to find these things basically but maybe it looks really good in CS go or something and what's really important in all of this is that all of us other reviewers Brandon me ploof we are splitting hairs at this point so yeah it might be faster it might be clearer but to my eye imperceptibly so and to put things into perspective the average gaming mouse is going to have anywhere from one and a half to three milliseconds of processing latency on its own I mean your keyboard if it has a thousand Hertz pulling rate might manage one millisecond but we are getting to the point where these numbers are so low and so fast that we are realistically gated by our weak human flesh not by the gear that we're using regardless of which of these three monitors it is when we're talking about an extra four or five milliseconds for your peripherals and the average person's reaction time is about 250 outside of the most extreme instances of Esports gaming the bottom line is it just doesn't matter which doesn't mean that gaming displays don't have any redeeming features the zowie model for example we've talked a lot about BFI or black frame insertion that dramatically improves motion Clarity it's not for everyone I personally don't like the generally reduced brightness or perceived flicker but for some folks it's a must-have and I've got to say to their credit this one actually has very little perceptible Flicker and is really bright so kudos to zali this is my first time seeing this one and compared to our OLED it manages to refresh 120 hertz faster I mean this is an incredibly crisp LCD display even for a TN one and that feature black frame insertion is notably absent from the aw2524h meaning that Alienware is counting on the Lightning Fast 500 Hertz refresh rate in order to sell this thing can they then well at 830 dollars this is a very premium 1080p monitor even compared to the 600 Valley but it's not entirely unjustified it's the first it looks much better thanks to its IPS panel and in its default standard picture mode we measured an average Delta e of just 1.5 with a maximum of six on red in particular it also seems to cover more of the advertised 99 of the srgb color space particularly red and purple so those might look a touch more saturated but not abnormally so this thing looks great it's also bright enough hitting about 390 nits with local dimming disabled 400 nits with it on and about 450 nits at all window sizes with hdr on with that being said there aren't many dimming zones on it and the HDR color accuracy wasn't great so don't expect an amazing cinematic experience with movies or games with it enabled as for the i o it's all right we get two HDMI 2.0 ports so that you can have I don't know nice fast pixel response times on your Xbox or your PlayStation or whatever a DisplayPort 1.4 with display stream compression which you will need in order to get to 500 Hertz though any GPU that could possibly drive a game at 500 frames per second is going to have DSC you get four USB a ports one of which is for an Nvidia reflex latency analyzer a headphone jack an audio line out and this super secret port for NVIDIA to update the firmware ah yes if that sounds exciting to you you must have missed the memo it has a g-sync module so if you like updating your own firmware in the event that fixes or new features roll out this model might not be for you only Nvidia can use that it has height adjustment swivel and tilt and this is kind of cool the stand itself takes up very little space on your desk meaning that you can get as close as you could reasonably want to to your monitor when you're trying to get every headshot and Counter-Strike speaking of which will it help you do that technically speaking sure I bet if you give this thing to a pro it could marginally improve their game because once you're at the top that's all you're chasing but if you are literally anyone else you're probably better off with just about anything else I mean on the premium side that lgola that we showed you earlier is almost two hundred dollars more but it's also a few inches larger higher resolution and will give you a great HDR experience and it's not even the only option a 240 hertz monitor will get you almost the same Real World experience as these and there is ample competition in that space meaning that those can be had for about 200 US dollars these days literally a quarter the cost of this and a third the cost of this whichever route you go we're going to have links down below I mean who knows maybe once we double up again and hit a thousand Hertz for one millisecond frame times I'll have a different Outlook you know with everything at a thousand Hertz the
