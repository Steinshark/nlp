this is the fastest seat the fastest CP fastest CPU on the planet in the world in the world and why do I feel like this has happened before it's because AMD keeps doing this they're all new epic Genoa CPUs are available with up to 96. Zen 4 cores and a single socket they support up to six terabytes of ddr5 memory and feature 128 Lanes of PCI Express Gen 5 connectivity there is quite literally nothing else in the world like it even the size it's absolutely monstrous and this video is sponsored by super micro Who provided not one but two servers rocking a total of three of these CPUs does the math even work out to on that that's like almost 300 cores we've got to break some World Records today ladies and gentlemen [Music] the first thing that's new about epic Genoa aside from everything is the socket like its predecessors it uses an LGA style socket meaning that the pins are built into the motherboard rather than the bottom of the CPU but unlike its predecessors it has a whopping 600 and 96 pins necessitating a massive landing pad on the motherboard and a seven screw hold down mechanism in order to make sure that even contact is made with all those little pins but they absolutely need them and the biggest reason they need them is that to keep those 96 cores fed with data and working efficiently aside from having 384 megabytes of onboard cache epic Genoa features a not two not four not six but 12 channel ddr5 memory controller yeah it only runs at 4 800 Mega transfers per second but it's 12 channels that is an effective 12 Xing of the bandwidth of a single module hey we never did the size comparison with an Intel Desktop CPU check this out look at it like a little baby we seem to have run into a problem already I cleaned all the thermal compound off of this when we disassembled the server earlier and I don't know if we have enough paste in this building feeling like at like X for extreme we just used half a tube of thermal paste you ain't building more than one server with one of these if you got a dual CPU system on that note super micro who sponsored this video has a whole lineup of Epic Genoa systems available right at launch everything from their Cloud DC Workhorse affordable systems like the one I'm working on right now all the way up to their hyper and GPU oriented servers which are for absolutely zero compromises performance I mean can you really say it's a compromise and performance if you have up to 192 CPU cores and up to 160 pcie lanes and a single system you cannot even though AMD has switched to a heatsink actuated socket so that is to say screwing in the heatsink is what applies enough pressure to the CPU to make contact with the pins I Gotta Give Them credit for still having that tray and that holder to keep it in place because men when you install some of the competition CPUs where they don't have that retention it is scary oh wait okay this is bad CPU just lifted up quick note if it was important to have amd's previous high performance sockets torqued correctly it is triply important to have these sockets torqued correctly because even one screw slightly over or under tightened is going to have the CPU sitting like this in the socket that's going to be a real bad time you can have everything from memory channels not detected to flaky PCI Express Behavior to A system that doesn't boot at all one of the drawbacks of having a 12 channel memory controller is that if you want to get the maximum performance out of your system you better be ready to install a lot of memory sticks which isn't to say that you have to use 12 though if you want to do less than that I would strongly recommend checking amd's documentation because it is not as simple as just popping sticks in wherever you want oh this is the first time I've been hands on with a ddr5 server module now regular ddr5 has a form of error checking and correction or ECC but it's only handled at the Die Level whereas a full ECC module is going to have to have an extra die for every eight which actually is not how this is configured these have 10 packages per side so do they actually have two ECC packages per eight after a bit of off-camera research it seems to be related to the way that individual ddr5 memory dies operate more like two previous generation dies meaning that instead of needing one chip per group of eight you need one chip per group of four so these are fully proper ECC dimms that will protect data even when it's in flight there's some other differences too just like consumer ddr5 modules the power management IC or pmic is built into the module rather than into the motherboard but unlike consumer modules the notch is in a different place meaning that you won't be able to have a motherboard that will support both unbuffered and ECC memory at least as far as I can tell this is all very very new at the moment before we go too much further and start covering things up now is the perfect opportunity to talk not just about the performance but also the flexibility a platform like epic Genoa provides I mentioned already that each of these CPUs supports up to 128 Lanes of PCI Express gen 5. that means even on a basic server from Super micros Cloud DC lineup you are looking at an utterly unbelievable amount of connectivity this one alone we've got dual ocp 3.0 cards which are typically used for networking we've got these cxl slots okay each of these running at pciegen 5x16 and cxl is so cool it uses the same physical connections as PCI Express but a new protocol that allows you to do wild things like put a a separate memory controller into a slot in your computer and add a whole bunch more RAM to it like what and even if you fill all of this stuff up in a server like this one that's using three and a half inch Bays you are going to run out of slots before you're going to run out of pcie lanes as you cram the front of it full of ssds now unfortunately PCI Express Gen 5 ssds haven't hit the market yet but when they do things are going to get really cool because instead of needing four lanes to get the most out of these ssds in non-performance critical applications like say it's more about capacity you're going to be able to take just two Gen 5 lanes and get the same performance you would have gotten from four Gen 4 Lanes just one generation ago and what was really mind-blowing for me thinking about how fast PCI Express Gen 5 is a single pcie Gen 5 Lane is the same speed as a 16x slot of pcie gen 1. I think size doesn't matter that much Yvonne you're watching this right look they can't even put full-size slots on the board they just got these 8X are those 8X I think they're 8X and this has applications outside of just storage as well say for example we were going to take this pcie gen 5x16 slot right here and plug a you know daughter board or mezzanine card into it we could plug in literally four pcie gen 4x8 cards and have all of them run at full freaking speed that's wild well you need a pretty complex pcie switch to go back to Gen 4 and have that full bandwidth but but that's not the point the point is that outside of storage and networking almost nothing needs Gen 5 bandwidth anyway and you can see super micro knows that so this is just a simple daughter board that is absolutely covered in Gen 5 Lanes we go from 16 to 16 to 80 lanes and they figure this will probably be fine and they're probably right not that we're doing anything like that with it we're just using one of these slots for an RJ45 network card because we don't have the PC build corner wired up with qsfp which is with the network card that super micro sent over with this thing uses okay there's one more thing about this socket that I didn't tell you guys yet unlike amd's previous server socket sp5 is rated for up to 400 watts which is like what I thought Zen 4 was more efficient well yeah it is but we went from up to 64 cores to up to 96 cores some concessions had to be made and that's why can I remind you again this is a cloud DC like Workhorse class server super micro is shipping 1200 watt redundant power supplies in a server that's not even designed for GPU use spicy look how long this thing is not that it's about length Yvonne you're watching this right it's not about length but is it longer than a 40 90. oh 40 90 for scale okay let's fire this thing up we have a liftoff now for best possible cooling we're going to want to put the top cover on this because otherwise these fans instead of drawing air across these nvme drives and blowing it through the CPU heatsink they're just drawing air from here and blowing it out here also that's really annoying that's a little better three hours later no but in all seriousness at the moment epic Genoa takes about 10 minutes to boot up but AMD says they are working on that so good gotta get that memory training going hey hey we had time to go get monitors plug them all in get all the network and we're only halfway there oh good since we're still waiting we might as well take this opportunity to talk about one of Super micro's Hyper servers the main difference between Cloud DC and Hyper platform servers is that instead of one CPU with up to 96 cores you've got up to two CPUs with up to 96 cores that's right 192 cores that's 384 threads and up to 12 terabytes of ddr5 memory you've also got okay you lose some of the pcie lanes in CPU to CPU connectivity so 160 Lanes of pcie Gen 5 and that means that whether you want to connect 10 flip and gpus to one of these things or many many additional nodes of storage devices they have got the horses one cool thing is that if you're more into compute than expansion you can configure the CPUs to allocate more of their pcie Lanes to socket to socket communication leaving you only 128 Lanes but more bandwidth between your sockets indeed huh we're gonna try and put this in here um hmm hey did it finally boot yeah we're in Windows now that was literally over 15 minutes we need something to put that GPU on because it's sitting a little funky what could go wrong huh perfect holy crap this is one CPU 96 cores I mean I only have 1.85 gigahertz right now but they'll get faster what we're expecting is somewhere in the range of around 2.4 gigahertz when all cores are under load which means you actually kind of need to think carefully about your application when picking an epic Genoa processor if you want higher clock speeds you may not necessarily be better off with the the higher tier higher core chip one cool thing by the way about Super micro's Hyper lineup that we're not showing off very well is that compared to Cloud DC they are totally tool-less it's pretty nice when you got to work on a hundred of them so how will I use my Screwdriver from lttstore.com we ready boom well that's a disappointment JK JK JK I ran it in single core mode I actually just wanted to see what it would clock to and it looks like task manager is not going to give us a useful account of that so on here you don't have HW if I put it I I focused on the other server you focused because I had two of them oh he focused he says you should be thankful I got it I should be thankful Hardware info has either crashed or hung both times I've tried to launch it I'm not blaming them this is an extremely new platform I'm just saying we're not going to know exactly what frequency that chorus running at sorry here we go uh oh my goodness whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa buddy to put it's done that's a 32 core threadripper with that tiny little blue bar 75 000 and this is this is one chip now that's not that impressive compared to a threadripper which obviously will Turbo quite a bit higher but it's just one it's just one we can have two think this one's done booting up now is it is it in have we hacked the Mainframe are we getting the windows spinny unfortunately our RTX 49d experiment did not work it's not showing up we did manage to get a Quadro GPU working earlier but we're not going to break any world records with that so we're going to focus on CPU performance for the time being starting of course with cinebench but now with two 96 core CPUs 384 threads and two sockets they completely break the UI look at this you have to scroll it's full screen and you have to scroll look at the L3 cache oh shoot I had level three Cash on the Mind earlier when I said these things had three quarters of a gig of cash no no they've got almost an entire gigabyte of cash the 768 Megs is just level three this thing has more cash than my first gaming system had Ram we've got a problem this is only running 256 of our 368 threads I didn't think about that but cinebench actually has a thread count limit we only got 82 000 points now hold on just a gosh darn minute here is there a quick and easy way for us to turn off smt oh no oh my God we have to reboot we're not rebooting we're gonna find other benchmarks to run time to Benchmark pie for those unfamiliar why cruncher calculates Pi up to what is this two quadrillion decimal places we have absolutely no idea what we're doing which is why it'll be so embarrassing when we're at the top of the league enter your choice Benchmark pie one multi-threaded okay so we need two and a half billion seven or nine no we'll do seven we're going for seven let's go one moment please wow it's done and the fans barely even kicked in holy crap 15.783 seconds holy crap this is not just faster this is like half the time and this record was set back in December of 2021 okay how do we submit a score I have no idea we're logged into hardware bot Linus Tech 6969 and wait what invalid data file but unable to encrypt the what what I'm able to encrypt what it's a text file what does it say in the instructions blah blah blah blah blah blah well I have no idea this is not encrypted you guys saw it it's fast this video is wrong past Linus we moved the server over to the server room and we are remote into it right now using super micro's integrated ipmi KVM and all we're gonna do is Click right here and ready ready wait for it bloody hell where is it yeah there it is go Team Canada not only do we have the record in this No Holds Barred competition but we are holding it by nearly half the time but one record is not enough for us that's why we installed Ubuntu and fired up the faronix test Suite where we will be benchmarking I don't know why don't we start with x264 ah boss first four okay winner dinner made of chicken uh can chickens here's what we're going for the number to beat is 75 frames per second average for this test we compare results on open benchmarking.org which isn't a competitive site like hardware bot but it does show us the top result which was a dual 32 core epic system that managed 75 frames per second plus or minus two where are we at here 108 frames per second see you later record goodbye box plot of samples old line new line yes I certainly would like to upload this now it's time to take a run at John the Ripper which is a password cracking benchmark recently saved to enter a name of the results file okay dinner fish winner delicious but fishy estimated time to completion four minutes no unacceptable wait am I reading this right 26 million I would like to upload it though see you later records previous winner fish dinner time to run blender let's go classroom let's see if we can cause some trouble on their site here we go estimated time to completion two minutes I doubt it 19 seconds is the time to beat for classroom oh crap my file name was too long um whoops oh crap I definitely broke some things um wait 21.9 seconds uncool uncool it's not that this system isn't ripping fast it's just that clearly someone with another dual 96 core test system got here first well it's a long day breaking record four seems seems pretty good in conclusion epic Genoa really fast super micro really cool hardware for epic Genoa check them out with the link down below if you guys enjoyed this video I think I probably recorded one of these before so let's just cut that back in if you guys enjoyed this video you might also enjoy the uh maybe more a structured platform overview that we did when AMD announced epic Genoa and you can check that out here here somewhere
