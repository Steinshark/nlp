hey everyone what's up i've been super busy and i feel like i'm falling behind um so we're doing a six-week resume critique bulk right now and uh the first week was setting up your first resume and you know getting all the the material that you currently have on it and then the second week we are going to be p the second week we are going to be picking what area of tech is for you so when i was in like first and second year i didn't really even know what areas of tech there was and people kept saying pick the one that interests you and i was like well how do i know which one interests me so today i'm gonna prompt you with some questions and based on your answers to those questions it should kind of tell you which tech you might be interested in and at least give you the opportunity to try it before you commit to it so very broadly i'll break it down into like four different categories there's front end there's back end there's embedded and then there's kind of like machine learning stuff and obviously there are more than this but let's just talk about these ones these are kind of the biggest ones so you probably hear people say full stack also that's just a combination of both front end and back end now if all of this is gibberish don't worry i'm going to go through it so first things first front end is like what you see on your screen when you go to a website that's basically what the front end is or you know on your phone when you've got an app open that's the front end that you're looking at it's the visual stuff and that's usually done with javascript but like i said if it's an android app maybe it's done with java the back end is like the solution the web server basically that serves up data to that app and so uh full stack would be kind of you do both of those things so you're gonna implement stuff on the backend serve that data up and then you'll also implement the code to pull that data down onto the application that the user is using embedded solutions is is really like low level programming stuff like operating systems and bluetooth engineering and all that kind of stuff and that's going to be primarily done in c plus and it's very low level it's they call it low level it's like right above the hardware and the last is uh machine learning which of course is like kind of a very high level thing it's it's it's mostly statistics and it's usually done in python or r now how could you know which one of these is for you well i'm gonna go through some questions so kind of take down take some notes and and think about these questions and think about how you know this applies to your life so first off do you like designing things visually like aesthetics and photography like do you have an instagram dedicated to you know nice picture taking because if you do then you might actually really enjoy front end because your job is going to be making things look nice and feel nice and interact well that's going to be really about like aesthetics right do you like solving problems but maybe they don't have any look to them if you like going through proofs or something maybe it's like it's like you just like solving problems and you don't care how it looks that's really what back end systems is like it's just code so if you don't really care about things looking nice and you don't need it to have some kind of interface that people can look at and poke at and you just wanted to do cool things then back end might be for you do you like building stuff from nothing like absolutely nothing all the way into something that's actually usable even if the thing you're building isn't that useful and the question i'm asking here is to try to get a feel if you would be best in embedded solutions because when you're going to be working in like an embedded environment you are going to be implementing all the things you need like you're going to be recreating the wheel basically you're going to need to learn how to make your own fire it's going to be tough to build an entire application by yourself that's embedded because you have to do so much and so the analogy i use here is would you rather create an entire restaurant or would you rather really really really focus on just making the pasta right because you can't have a whole restaurant if you were just know how to make pasta it's such a big endeavor to have a whole restaurant you could have an entire team of people and if you could focus on one small aspect the pasta for example and you know everything would run swimmingly but if you want to be like a full stack developer front end or back end you can kind of make applications all by yourself you can kind of make the whole product right you can make the whole restaurant but when it comes to embedded solutions you really can only focus down on one thing and do that thing really well because it takes so much work to do anything well i hope that wasn't a confusing analogy and of course with that comes c plus plus and hardware if you're interested in hardware and c plus if you've played around with them maybe if you've tinkered around and taken a few things apart when you were a kid maybe that would be for you and then last but not least do you like statistics like machine learning is all statistics and i think people love to go into it nowadays because it's the hot buzzword but like seriously it's all statistics and if you don't like statistics it's gonna suck well it's probability too it's statistics and probability and so if you don't like either of those things uh your life is gonna suck so i recommend thinking about what types of math you actually like to do because maybe something like back end is better for you and that's in that case so i'm gonna explain to you guys what technologies and languages you should learn given how you answer those previous questions so let's say for example you are one of those aesthetic people i talked about well most front end is done in javascript so you should learn javascript but also you're going to need a framework to pair with that and a good framework the best one i think is called react it was made by facebook i talk about it on this channel all the time the next most popular is probably angular which was made by google there's one called vue.js and basically those are really great options if you want to get into making a front end you should start there on the back end you've got a few different languages to choose from it's not all js so you could do js right you could do javascript the most popular framework being node you could do python the most popular framework probably being django you could do java a popular framework is called spring you could do golang it's a popular it's a really kind of new and popular back-end programming language created by google ruby on rails is another good one that's used by like twitter c-sharp of course as i use at work uh and then like php but don't use php don't even dare then if you want to go into machine learning you're basically gonna have to learn python um you could learn r but really just python is your go-to like i already said if you want to get into embedded solutions you're gonna have to learn c and c plus plus so if you're at the end of this whole video you're still a little bit confused you're like i don't really know which category i fall into probably somewhere between front-end and back-end my recommendation to you is just learn javascript and the reason for that is javascript can be used for front-end and it can be used for back-end so you're really covering two of the categories right there and you might even really enjoy doing both and then end up doing full stack and that's kind of the thing that i'm really interested in myself next week we're going to determine what a good project to work on would be and we're going to come up with some tips for how to create a cool side project so sorry this video was so quick and so rushed and threw together but in order to keep us on track i had to make it today uh and i'm really busy today so thank you guys so much for watching i will catch you in the next episode
