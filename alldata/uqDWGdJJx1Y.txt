so hello everybody i am sitting here with paul kingsnorth paul king north is a writer uh from the uk he has written several novels also several other other books and uh he's been kind of put on my horizon by several people have been telling me that you need to i need to pay attention to him uh rodriguez and then several priests actually and many artists that are around me and so i'm actually reading one of his novels now the novel beast but i thought it would be a good opportunity for you to meet him and to talk a little bit about his journey and his vision of where we are in the world and how we can be how we can play a positive role in where the world is going this is jonathan pedro welcome to the symbolic world and so paul thank you for coming i really appreciate you giving me the time here well thanks for inviting me on it's great to meet you yeah wonderful so i'm right now i'm starting your novel i have to admit that i i'm not very far into it so i'm not completely aware i've read a little bit a few of your articles and a bit of your um of your vision of of how artists can participate in this so maybe you can tell us a little bit about your own journey in terms of uh how you see how you've seen the world and what that's where that's brought you and then we can talk about some vision of the future let's say yeah sure i mean it's um yes it's kind of strange and winding journey like for a lot of us i imagine i mean i've uh i've been a writer for about 25 years now in various forms always wanted to be one but i was also um i was also an environmental activist for a long time and and that came um that really developed out of a what i can i can't really only describe it as a spiritual connection to nature i know that sounds terribly vague but i've always had a sort of religious or sense of religious or spiritual sensibility in terms of connection with places and love of the natural world i had that since i was a child and that sort of turned itself into environmental activism when i was a student i spent a lot of time campaigning to protect forests and campaigning to protect landscapes and a lot of direct action a lot of political activism climate change and all the rest of it um and the more you look into that the more you start to realize that there's a deep disconnection between people and places between people and nature and that actually that that's to me a spiritual concern as much as anything else and that was one of the things that led me in the end to sort of i suppose part ways with the mainstream green movement which is highly technocratic very political um very much sees the environmental crisis globally as a sort of technical problem or a political problem to be solved with machinery or carbon counting or political agreements whereas to me it's a problem of relationship um a real major global and particularly western problem with the way that we're living in terms of the rest of nature or creation however you want to put it um and certainly in recent years we're starting to see a big cultural disintegration in the west we're starting to see um major ecological disintegration everywhere in terms of climate change and mass extinction and all sorts of other horrors that we hear about all the time and the more i look at this the more i've been putting it all together in my writing in fiction and non-fiction the more i've seen it as a as a kind of interlinked cultural and ecological crisis which is ultimately a root i think a spiritual crisis it's about us being completely out of relationship with with life actually with the rest of human life the way that we live with each other but also the the non-human life and that that's just that's a spiritual question that's about how we're living with with creation with each other so really i've been on a journey from activism to kind of post-activism i suppose if you like and now now a kind of very openly uh i suppose religious or spiritual aspect to that where i think okay what's what's the reason what's the big picture here what's really going on what's the brokenness at the heart of this because something is very broken and i think we can all feel that and and particularly since 2020 it's just been kind of accelerating at light speed i think we can all feel something really big is going on and it isn't nice and we don't quite know how to put it down but think all sorts of things are falling apart and that's a difficult thing to live through but it's also the way i try to look at it is it's also the beginning of something else you know something else is coming along here and what is it is the question that i suppose interests me now yeah one of the things that has been interesting to me watching the environmental question has been how the discourse has has often been radicalized in the sense that the i always have this sense that the modern world is really a deincarnation you know that christianity it's as if christianity had a a kind of synthetic worldview let's say that became quite strong in the middle ages and then in the renaissance and enlightenment things started to split and we didn't see the fruits of that at first but now we're really seeing the the fruits and uh you know in i've always actually had a tenuous relationship with the environmental kind of activism because what i saw in it was a something of an extreme kind of coming out and this the the idea even the idea of like nature as a value in itself like the idea of nature the idea of the wild you could say uh because there's something of the place that you talk about which which which brings human consciousness to the fore right the idea of a place in the sense that we recognize this as a having respect or reverence for a place means that it it's like a the garden is the best image of that where there is a human element in the sense of a human recognition of a boundary and then this this like natural interaction within the the space whereas what i've noticed in the um a lot of the environmental rhetoric is this kind of fetishization of the of the wild let's say and a hatred almost of almost an anti-human quality in it i don't think it's there everywhere maybe it's there mostly in those that make the most noise and so we kind of hear it more um and so because of that i've been i've always been tenuous about it i i appreciate the desire because i see the insanity of of of western culture like i can notice the insanity of uh consumerism and the and this complete uh treating the world like heidegger talked about right there the idea of the world as the standing reserve is just this stuff that we can use to to further our own agenda um and so and so i i'm curious about your vision of that because i i haven't seen at least me i haven't seen a lot of people that are able to kind of find that balance in the cosmological sense almost like in a in a symbolic sense well it's interesting isn't it i mean the the i mean look i wrote a manifesto called uncivilization right so i'm i've been quite quite deep in this but look i mean the people are in in the radical green movement especially people are desperate to protect the wild because we're destroying it so fast so if you look at it in terms of balance there's always a balance between the wild world which is the world that basically isn't under the control or domination of humans mainly modern humans and and human civilization now i tend to think that in a traditional society in a pre-modern society in other words there's a reasonable balance between the human and the non-human world and you don't have a kind of environmental conversation because you don't need one because you're not destroying everything you're in some reasonable balance with it you know you don't have to romanticize nature but you don't demonize it either and you don't just treat it as a resource i mean i live in rural ireland there's a great long tradition of of folk culture here just as there is in england where i come from which has a weary respect for nature and which treats it well and you have to do that because it's a living web what we've done and i think i don't think this is a problem of so of western culture so much as it's about modernity because it's started here but it's global now um where we have basically desold everything that isn't human right and increasingly desold other humans as well but we treat the world as a resource because we treat um we treat the whole of life as a machine and we treat most of non-human life and indeed much human life as a kind of resource to be fed into that machine and turned into profit at the other side so that's a question of that's as i say this is a spiritual matter because it's question of respect for creation which includes humans um and if you don't if you don't respect that if you create a giant machine that eats everything effectively and destroys destroys everything and tries to turn it into plastic junk that we don't even need then you're going to get a huge reaction in in terms of people who want to defend the wild from from humans and what happens a lot is that people get human civilization the worst aspects of modernity confused with human beings and they say humans are the problem humans aren't the problem but the way that modern humans are living is the problem and that's that's a problem in any number of ways not just in terms of i mean i see the the destruction of the natural world the wild world is as a symptom of of the bigger crisis and and that the sort of disintegration of aspects of our culture at the moment is a symptom of the same crisis i think i mean you mentioned the garden i think it's very interesting that i think a lot about the the notion of eden and the fall um you know the the sort of primal story of christianity is that we begin in communion in a garden with everything else that's alive and with god who's so close to us that we can see him walking around okay and and there we are everything is there all life is there and we chose to leave that because we chose power and knowledge and and desire if you like individual self-will over communion so we've spent the whole of history trying to get back again you know or attempting to rebuild our own garden here on earth which is effectively the point we're coming to now after so many centuries of trying to to build our own godless world with us at the center of it this is what we've come to and and the destruction of you know the fact that you can change the climate of a whole planet by playing god um to me that's a spiritual matter you know so the question is then not you know what technology should we use instead of this one the question is so what what happened that's that's the result of eating the apple if you like so what do we do now what do we do now that's a spiritual matter that's a that's got to have a spiritual answer to it there's an interesting image because you can see if you look at the story of the fall you can notice how technology is an answer to the fall and it's it comes from kane's lineage so kane is the first one to build a city and then you can see this kind of pendulum swing between what you could call the wild and civilization the biggest example is of course the flood which is which is let's say this coming in of the wild to take revenge let's say on on on excess of order and then right away after the flood what is the first thing they want to do is they want to build a tower they build a tower so it's like if there ever a flood comes again you know we'll be safe and so you see this kind of pendulum moving back and forth between these two extremes and the the powerful imagery of the new jerusalem is actually a balance that people wouldn't think that that's how the balance should be but it's a it's a powerful balance because in the center of the city is the tree and the water of life and then on the margin is the the wall of the city and so we tend to think the opposite we tend to think that it's like the city in the center and then the trees in the wild on the outside but the image that is brought about in the new jerusalem is rather of this this kind of pristine reality in the center and then the the wall is there to kind of protect almost protect that that uh pristine reality rather than rather than the opposite let's say um and but it's it's pristine but it's also more of a garden than it is just of the let's say of the wild the way that we understand it because in the in the last image it also says that the that there's no ocean which is actually a crazy image that that image is hard to totally understand when it says in revelation that there's no ocean left you're thinking there's no ocean no chaos at all like i don't totally get it uh but but that's the final images of this let's say there's flowing water but not uh not this kind of chaotic water let's say as i don't know if you ever if you ever noticed that this this this interesting final image of how the garden and the city come together in the no no i hadn't thought of that actually no but i mean i think yeah the tower of babel is another one of those great stories i puzzled over for ages i thought this is very strange stories of what's going on here but yeah it's this is everyone gets together and says you know if we build this high enough we'll we'll get up we'll get back to god where we should be and yeah and it's also the one thing that's kind of implicit in the story is that it's getting back to god but it's also avoiding the flood because they just came out of a flood and so they're saying if we build up high enough you know we'll reach the god and then we'll also be safe if there are these these waters because there's a tradition that says that the garden of eden was never like san fran the syrian there's a tradition that talked about how the garden of eden uh was never flooded and that the the water of the flood came up to the gates of the garden and never entered um so this image of this reality which is above the chaos and kind of holds and the man says no i'm going to build that like i'm going to build a mountain you know i'm going to build a a thing that's going to avoid any problem and like right now if you understand like when we look at the control measures of of of coba that are being set into place you get a sense that there's something of that where it's where people think that they're going to create a world where there's no danger where there's no risk this is the machine isn't it surely right this is this is the fall this is what you do when you eat the apple right you say i'm not going to trust god which is the same thing as trusting nature actually because that's the creation right i'm not going to trust god i'm not going to be in the garden i'm not going to live within the natural law i'm going to take control of everything and i'm going to build a world which is better what that means is a world that's better for people okay so it doesn't matter if we kill everything else to do that and it doesn't matter if we end up actually putting ourselves into a kind of slave state where we have no freedom either because at least we're in control so it's this desperate grasping for too much order and then then the pendulum swings and then comes the chaos which is the climate change which is the extinction which is the cultural disintegration because that's what happens if you try power without wisdom yeah that's i just you know this is this constant i'm finding you know it's interesting to me when i look at the new testament when i look at the gospels and i think the ultimate image of jerusalem there is an image of murderous power right i mean over the over civilization of jerusalem it's when jesus goes to jerusalem that he's tortured and brutalized and killed most of the time he's wandering around in small cities he's hanging around by the lake cooking fish on the floor he's um you know he's he's in the small towns he's in the villages he's going barefoot it's when he goes to the city and tries to take the message to the heart of empire that he ends up crucified that's what the power does you know it's like the city as an image of this great controlling kind of moloch this this babylon if you like there's always a balance and if the if it gets out of balance you know we talk about chaos in order if the balance gets out this is what you do and it seems to me that modernity takes obviously takes god out of the picture and that means it takes humility out of the picture and it takes if you remove obviously anything that's above you then you become the center of the picture so humans are at the center of the modern story so why not just make the world in our image and we know where this ends up this ends up in silicon valley this ends up in transhumanism this ends up with let's upload our minds and live forever and let's re let's remake everything in the world from the nano level downwards so that it suits modern human beings which is the kind of the project at the moment and yeah absolutely with kovid has kind of accelerated this race towards great controlling machine and it's uh it is like um very much like the temptation of uh of the snake you know it's very much like the devil's offer it's like well you can look you get all this power but obviously you lose all of your freedom you know and you destroy the and the rest of nature but never mind because at least you can behave like gods yeah and there's there's the images that you brought about of jerusalem is so powerful because we know that jerusalem also got destroyed and some one of the warnings that christ is telling them and they don't know but they they don't understand but he's telling them like it's coming there's something coming you don't see it but there's a there's something on the horizon it's almost like there's a play on the story of jonah in christ's story because jonah goes to the city warns the city and they repent and he says even that the animals repent which is really fascinating and so he says that they repent and then god preserves the city uh whereas christ is basically telling them you need to repent they don't and then jerusalem is uh is actually destroyed yeah god is not mocked yeah actions have consequences you know and so tell me a little bit because i i know that your journey ultimately did lead you to to to christianity to orthodoxy and so i'm curious to know a little bit about your process about how you because for a lot of although i although i think that you sense and i sense that this is a move that's happening like there's a there's an interesting zeitgeist right now there's a there's a there's a capacity of people to move towards christianity and to understand it that maybe wasn't there even 20 years ago uh but i'd like you maybe to hear kind of in your words how this how this led how you were led to this yeah well i was led to it because i didn't want to go there um at all i did not want to be a christian i'd point this out i didn't like christianity and i didn't like christians and i didn't want to be a christian so you know god's got a sense of humor he definitely has got a sense of humor i mean look i was a kind of eco pagan right when you're when you're an environmentalist you know you're in love with nature and and you want to if you if you realize this is a spiritual matter and so many people do um you end up wanting some sort of container for that and so people look for that but there isn't one um in the modern world i mean you know there are all sorts of old nature religions around but we haven't got them anymore in the west there's no way of connecting with the divine through nature in any serious way so you try all sorts of things and i've tried all sorts of things i mean i was actually a zen buddhist for a while that's a slightly different uh different tact but i started about ten years ago looking for a path and i practiced zen and zen zen is a very good path it's a very disciplined serious old past but but there was something missing from it which turned out to be god which is what i was looking for and then i was into yeah i was exploring all sorts of mythical parts over as a wiccan for a while which was interesting um and quite fun but again you have a sense that this is a modern thing that's been constructed out of old bits some of which work and some of which don't but it isn't there's no theology to it there's no seriousness to it there's something isn't there and and this is you know the state of the modern world is i think where so many orthodox people especially get into reading father seraphim rose you know because he's like the patron saint of lost western people who go through everything before they find christianity i mean he was he was doing everything he was studying chinese he was practicing every faith because this is what we do in the west because we haven't we feel we have nowhere to go and the reason for that is that the western church for so long was tied up with power it was tied up with the institutions that actually were crushing people and were destroying the earth and there's the old christian story about dominating and subduing earth which everybody believes is what the faith is about and so for rightly or wrongly everybody has a very negative um attitude to christianity and especially established christianity um because it seems to be tied up with the system that's crushing everything you know it's tied up with the civilization that everyone in the west has been rebelling against since at least the 1960s and so you don't look there and you know i didn't look there i thought well obviously the christianity's got nothing for me because that's i went to enough assemblies at school where i had to listen to vicars lecturing me about the gospels and had no idea what they were talking about and it's just um so i didn't expect to be a christian but i had i mean i had a number of things happen to me over the last 18 months i had dreams i had visions i had weird things weird stuff happening i mean i was i was literally dragged you know this is jesus is quite good at this isn't it he turns up and drags you in he shepherds you in he says look come on wake up mate get a grip this is where you're supposed to be going so i was sort of a lot of things happened to me i suddenly had christians coming at me left right and center emailing me and talking to me about my books and for no reason at all and it was just like in the end i couldn't ignore it and i thought this must be real because i don't want it to happen so you know i started exploring it talking to people and praying and learning what it was all about and looking for a church and the more i read about christianity especially mystical christianity but also especially about eastern christianity the more i thought this isn't the story i thought it was you know i thought christianity was a bunch of moral lessons i thought it was a bunch of things you were supposed to do so that you went to heaven instead of hell and you had to be good and do certain things and i thought why would i need a guy from 2000 years ago to tell me that and i don't believe it anyway but the more i realized what was actually going on the more i realized that this is a mystical path it's a path to god um it's a path of stripping back and renunciation and the more i found orthodoxy i had a couple of friends who turned out to be orthodox christians which i hadn't even really known before and then i started reading the desert fathers and i started reading the the you know the the philicalia and i thought wow this is really this is powerful stuff this beats anything that the buddhists have got to offer you know or at least it's actually very similar in some ways in terms of the depth of of the mystery and i thought yeah this this church thing that i thought i knew about is not what not what i thought it was and here's a powerful path and then of course you start reading the gospels and you think that there is i can't think of anything that's more radical actually than the teaching of christ and you know once you start to separate that out from many hideous things people have done with it over the centuries you think well this is this is just as relevant as it ever was and we're completely failing to do this this is radical humility and if we had practiced this um we wouldn't be in this situation you know we wouldn't be here so the sort of um and then i was i was reading the irish philosopher john moriarty he's a very interesting man who kind of combined his love of the irish landscape and myth with his christianity he rejected christianity as well he ran off to canada actually he became an academic um and then came back home and i was reading his autobiography and he has a line in there and he says the story of christianity is the story in a story of man's rebellion against god and i thought wow i'd never seen it like that and it kind of all clicked into place when i read that i thought that's exactly what this is isn't it we're rebelling against god we've put ourselves at the center of the picture we've eaten the whole world and now we're eating ourselves because we're still in that rebellion so what would trying to get back to god look like and when you realize that actually what christ is teaching you is the way back you know but you do have to carry across so it's not much fun it's not it's not an easy it's not an easy path that you can you know add to your consumer package but i thought this yeah this is um this is real and then i thought what am i going to do with that information so here i am yeah yeah but i think you're i think your your path is really reflecting so many of us let's say that found uh traditional christianity ancient christianity uh you know reading it's actually there's actually it's actually a positive thing right now in the sense that with the new atheists and with kind of uh really um let's say superficial uh superficial western christianity there's a surprise element that is possible it's like if you read saint gregor vanessa if like you said you read the philo kalia people don't expect that they they they've never heard about any of this and so it's almost like uh like you know open up the curtain at the end and just revealing this mystery that people didn't think was there so it there's something exciting about about that as well one of the things that i've been working on with a lot of people and i i think you might find this interesting is also going really going back into the the legendary aspects of christianity and just going you know not avoiding anything you know you were talking about in ireland and you know people who were able to unite the ancient irish thinking and kind of this mythical thinking with christianity and i think that this is something that is really it's worth our time and our effort because it's one of the solutions it's one of the things that's going to re-enchant the world there's a reason why people love star wars and tolkien and harry potter and all of these all of these things is because they're finding something in there which is really true and which is really invigorating and and full of gives gives a sense of life and christianity had so much of that and it's it was kind of stripped away by rationalists and modernists to a point where christianity itself was stripped away um and rediscovering these ancient stories you know also even though like the whole a medieval synthesis of uh the trojan trojan legend with christianity and alexander the great with christianity and this kind of ambiguous uh universal story that that that was flexible it wasn't uh it wasn't like a system but it was this flexible uh web of references that could that could be drawn out and brought up and we could make participate in our story let's say um yeah i mean i think it's um what's so interesting about your work is that you're trying to find the symbolic pattern you know the picture of reality that christianity is actually teaching us which is not something i ever thought about i didn't think christianity had that like i said i thought it was just a list of moral rules you know over the last 10 years i've been reading a lot of mythology i have friends who are mythologists i work with i work with myth quite a lot and it's so obviously clear that humans need a mythic picture of the world we have a mythic mind we need to see these patterns in reality and if you know christianity is either true or it isn't and if it is then it should be able to take that picture for us and that picture should be able to interweave into our landscape and into every area of our lives it's not it's you know if christianity is a thing which is imposed from somewhere on you then it's a tyranny and it isn't real and it has behaved like that sometimes but actually at the root of it that's not what it is and it can you know it's so fascinating in ireland almost every few miles in ireland there will still be a holy well and the holy well will have a statue of mary over it it's never very very few statues of christ actually it's usually mary it's a feminine presence in this water there's still a great holy mountain patrick that people do a pilgrimage up to every year um it's it's very much christianity here has been in the landscape for so long you know for a thousand years or more and it still is actually even though much of the country is kind of walking away from from the church it's still somehow mystically in the place you know that's how it should be there's a pattern of as i say there's a pattern of reality which ought to be able to link us back to the the kind of the big symbolic world but also the ground under our feet as well that there's a way there's a way in which christianity kind of seeped in so deep in terms of a world view for a while uh that people took it maybe for granted and thought as they were starting to strip away its elements you know thought that the world would still that that the compass would still remain straight even if we started to strip that away and then as it gets stripped away suddenly things start to get shaky and fragile and we start to notice how things are falling apart yeah and i think that's exactly where we are in the west at the moment i think this is the final crumbling of christendom yeah because a culture can't survive without the divine at its center it's not possible whether it's christian or otherwise if you have not got a divine center to your culture you're going to collapse into nihilism which i think is what we're doing i don't know if you have this in canada we had this phenomena in britain for a while called atheist churches do you have it yeah i mean it's i find them very funny um but you know it's it's just it's just it's telling that people still need that structure they need a symbolic structure which is created to take them to god they just take god out yeah they still go you know because people can't actually manage we can't manage without some sense of of of that great symbol of god at the center of things yeah the funnier ones are like these kind of uh factus jedi orders and also there's a u.s called uh harry potter and the sacred text where people will like gather in these churches and they'll read harry potter almost liturgically um and then have these come like listen i haven't heard that right i mean cosplay is a great example of how much people need religion it's this desire to be in a story and to participate and to to have a mythical structure um but there's something like this is maybe what i'm seeing is that there's a mystery in even in the death of christianity almost as if it was something that was meant to happen you know christ seemed to have pointed us to that and prepared us for that um and it's almost as if just as christ dying planted a sea that cosmic seed that would would grow into what it would go into christendom it's almost as if christianity dying is doing something similar because as christianity is dying there's this distance which is created and all of a sudden we can see the christian story appear in places we couldn't see it before you know uh you know i kind of joke about every single hollywood movie it's basically has a all these hollywood action movies has a resurrection scene you need a resurrection team or else you're not going to make you know uh more than 100 million with your movie and so it's but that's a that's a it's like it's a christian story or even the idea of self-sacrifice all of a sudden we thought self-sacrifice was an obvious trope but it's not look at look at ancient greek myth you don't bit you barely find that that trope there's a maybe little little hints of it but it's not a major story whereas the notion that the hero sacrifices himself for others is a christian's story um and so as christianity retreats we can see it you can see it there and we can see how it's actually going to become more fragile as we as we retreat from that yeah i think david bentley heart said something about that one of his pieces that i read recently that you know as christendom dies back you can see christ more clearly which i think is a good way of putting it because you know also a lot of christendom did not actually represent christ at all you know a lot of it actually became so tied up with power that it became a culture um which wasn't necessarily following the teachings of christ at all so once that's gone um we can we can stand up and go okay well yeah now we can see what the teachings are so we can decide if we want to follow them or not and we can also see that we can also see the story more clearly perhaps when it doesn't well yeah like you say when we've lost it when we've lost the structures that were built around that story however imperfectly we all we can see the story but we can also start to feel very lost having lost it it might be a reason why so many people are suddenly including me finding themselves brought into christianity not no not for cultural reasons it's not it's not a political decision or anything like that it's but something's something's calling something's going on because it isn't possible it isn't possible to live for very long without without that sacred heart and the co the heart of your culture and that you and at the heart of you as well it's not you know i think you have the luxury of rejecting religion if you're in a culture which kind of holds it up but if you're in a culture that has nothing that if you're in a culture that has replaced any sense of the divine any sense of the sacred with basically consumerism and individualism then rejecting religion is suddenly not a fun piece of rebellion anymore you know it's like oh i think i've just realized what that thing was for that we destroyed yeah well it's funny because the atheist promised us a replacement right they promised us some some call great cultural replacement for the christian story and these these great acts of participation in this but that's not what we got what we got is porn and fast food like we didn't get because we didn't get you know a great start we don't get star trek yeah we don't get star trek like this wonderful rational culture of people who uh who uh explore with christian virtues the the galaxy it's like that's not what's going on we're getting something much much darker and much uh much stranger um well the other thing is that liberalism doesn't seem to work without christianity either yeah i think that's the big story of the moment that liberalism was the thing that was supposed to replace christianity but as you say and you know tom holland was very good on this in his book dominion he was he was he did a very good exploration of how liberalism is basically a reboot of christianity and it works when you have a society that still broadly has christian values but if they've gone you could abide by liberalism because there's no reason anyone would believe this stuff because we suddenly realize that we're all creating our own values and there's absolutely no reason we should all agree with each other and so there's no center you know and any society with no center is not a society and i've seen you you know you've talked about that at length i know but this is um this is where we are yeah so people are starting to look around and say well what was at the center what's going on here there's suddenly there's a whirling chaos what have we what have we missed out on yeah exactly and the desire to to replace that there's a there is a desire to replace it with this this kind of new woke uh culture um but it's a it's a dangerous game because it has a it has a very powerful scapegoat mechanism that is not that doesn't have a solution to it and so and so people who are kind of going down that road will find themselves they're going to find themselves like puritans flogging themselves uh constantly like this kind of self-deprecation and this like you that you see these um these uh struggle sessions like chinese struggle sessions that you see uh people are kind of posting about them because they're noticing that this is where we're going in terms of a culture uh and so i it's one it's what's strange is to realize all of a sudden that we're on the edge of culture it's like i'm noticing like i'm seeing the type of person that i would that i would have recognized before as being the the punks or the these kind of edge of culture people who can see where it's going and are making the the first first adopters i guess they call them um that i'm seeing i'm noticing that they're they're becoming christians because or becoming at least more traditional christians uh liturgical christians because liturgy they intuitively understand that there's something about the world which is magical and that there has to be a ritual form to it there has to be something you know there has to be this form that is binding reality together sometimes it's not it's not explicitly understood it's sometimes more intuitive um and then they can see they can see a liturgical life and ritual life as part of that so i don't know if that's something that you thought about yourself yeah no a lot actually i mean that's the other thing i discovered with orthodoxy is that the liturgy is so powerful the central ritual is so powerful and again western christianity didn't have any rituals in it or at least it does obviously but not not that i'd ever seen as being very significant because the reformation changes the role of a church from being a a center for ritual to being a sort of um center for moral teaching you know you take out the ritual i mean you still probably do the eucharist and stuff but it's a bit it's a bit by the by really what you're getting is a lecture and that's what i always thought christianity was that it's a lecturer who tells you what jesus wants you to do yeah but as soon as you experience a ritual then you think oh my goodness me this is what it's supposed to be about god's in the room you know this is what's supposed to be happening here and again a lot of the work i've done with mythologists and reading of myths from cultures around the world a culture can't survive without central rituals and they're always rituals which are designed to take people to the divine in some way beyond ourselves um and we haven't got that and even our christianity hasn't had that for a long time in protestant countries anyway um and so that's a major loss and it's one of these things that people don't even know they've lost yeah you know i grew up with not knowing i'd lost this it's a bit like initiation ceremonies that's another thing traditional cultures have you know you'd be initiated from childhood to adulthood in a serious culture we don't have that and so we're perpetually in arrested development you know all the adults are behaving like children yeah the aspiration of a 75 year old is to still look like a 30 year old that's you know because we haven't been initiated but we don't know we're missing that either and you know you mentioned that the sort of work culture thing i often think that social justice is like you say it's like it's like the sermon on the mount but without love or forgiveness or god so it's like all the stuff that you actually need to leaven that strict moral message that you get from christ is taken out and once you have once you have a kind of moral teaching without love or any higher purpose you have a tyranny potentially but at the heart of it is people trying to make something that they think they need because they don't know what they've lost yeah and it's uh so there's so many lost people you know we've all been there floundering about thinking there's something something is really missing there's a massive void here yeah but we have no idea how to fill it and i think that's where we are and but like you say there's that's a lesson that's given to us it's probably a lesson we need to learn so that's that's probably the question isn't it how do we learn that lesson then what do we draw from it yeah and how can we because i think a lot of people are going to learn that lesson one way or another you know one of the things we saw in 2020 is a return of a liturgical action um you know all the the george floyd protests the fact that they were worldwide which is just i mean it's just insane to think that something like that caused such a worldwide worldwide phenomena but it was really because it was a religious action you know it was based on a on a on a sacrifice which was experiment which was experienced as a catharsis by people and you know this kind of flowing out of religious feeling and then going out into the street and processing and chanting and and kneeling and doing all these uh these religious gestures and so it's coming back religion is coming back there's nothing we can do to stop it right now all the all the new atheists they they're wrong they're wrong about how reality works and uh it's playing out and the question is how is it going to play out because the sacred has a very the sacred or the desire for the sacred has a very dark tendency uh you know and if you read i was really i've been talking about the backing for some reason many times recently but you know if you you think of the this kind of uh this image of the sacred out of control which you see in in the bakke where there's this ripping apart right the sparagmos of the of the the of the people this is something which is right on our horizon if if there isn't if there isn't this balance which christ brought because that aspect of the sacred is there in the christian ritual as well you know the communion is scandalous communion has something of the human sacrifice in it but it's taken up into something more right it's taken up it's not let out into its extreme where it becomes a form of uh of uh of insane scapegoating or this kind of destruction of uh you know this ripping a part of the king or whatever it is that goes on in in these in this religious tendency we have it's brought into something higher um yeah i mean i think religious you know we all know what religious fanaticism looks like it's like a dark tendency and all of us like you say i think i think in watching in other real films recently you said religion is inevitable and i thought that was that really stuck with me because i thought yeah that's exactly right religion is inevitable so it can take any number of shapes and some of those shapes could be hideous right you could be the aztecs cutting the hearts out of children and throwing them down pyramids um or you can indeed be you know christians burning witches so there's any number of shapes that that fanaticism can take and if it isn't tempered by the fact that you're supposed to carry a cross and if it isn't tempered by the fact that you have to love your enemies even when they hate you right you're so you are mandated to love the people you hate basically and you'd better make an effort to do that because you know and you've got to forgive people 70 times seven times and all of this stuff which no none of us wants to do and it's really hard but that's you know it's got to be a reason that christ is endlessly telling us that and also endlessly telling us how how problematic wealth is and you know st paul's great great quote about how god uses the meek to humble the strong you know he uses the weak to teach the powerful and the fact that christ spends all his time with the poor and the meek and the dirty and all the people who are shunned he never spends any time with the powerful at all until right at the end and then when pilate asks him what truth is he won't tell it it just says my kingdom is not of this world it's got nothing to do with you you know if you want to know what truth is you better take your shoes off and follow me because i'm not going to explain it to you here you know that there's if you don't yeah if you haven't leavened it with that sacrifice of yourself and not other people yeah that's the key thing you've got to sacrifice yourself and not the bad guys out there because we all hate the bad guys out there and they're never asked it's always yours that's really that's the solution that christ offers it seems to us like a simple solution because we've been we've had it for 2000 years we think it's obvious but it's this is this was like the key to all of reality like the key of self-sacrifice that that christ gave us is basically the key to reality of how to temper all the elements to bring them all together because there is a there is this there is this need for this this perception we have that something has to be sacrificed and you know and then if you're able to to really understand that ultimately that's you then then you're able to to fulfill all the elements of reality uh into one into one thing but like you said it's so hard like who followed like the the thing about christ is that it's a it's this interesting situation where on the one hand his teaching is impossible like it's just completely impossible with the things he says are impossible and nonetheless they act as the source of reality you know and then you could say that we it all flows out of of of christ and no one really is able to completely follow what christ says because it's a it's it's a it's an impossible standard uh but it acts as this barrier that is very as this this ideal that that is a true ideal that we can that we can follow and so the self-sacrifice for some people will won't be this ultimate sacrifice but it will maybe just be like instead of drinking the money i get from my salary i'm gonna i'm gonna give it to my kids right i'm gonna actually buy food for my kids can be as stupid as small as that but then it's part of that notion of self-sacrifice which kind of feeds into the world and creates basically everything good about western society is based on on that it's based on the idea that we understand that the things we have we need to put them to the service of others if even if it's as little as that it still participates in this ultimate sacrifice which we should be aiming towards let's say yeah so everything good about western society comes from that teaching so if you take that out you just get everything that's bad about western society right you get all the colonialism and the coca-cola and and the self-righteousness but you don't have what's actually at the heart of it and what i find so interesting about reading the gospels as well is how honest they are about the fact that virtually everybody who's following christ also just walks away you know he's they're always going what are you talking about they don't understand yeah don't get it and they were saying well how can anyone do that you know what do you mean give all your money away what do you mean walk away from your parents what are you talking about and even at the last supper he says you know here's my body and here's my blood like most of them just say oh that's disgusting and then they all leave yeah well that scene in the gospel of john where he's actually in the crowd and he says if if those who do not drink my blood i need my flesh i have no part in the kingdom and you you i think i saw a movie version of it where they actually portrayed that scene he's standing in a crowd and he's telling people that and you think if i had been there i would have wanted to stone him too like would you think he's saying something completely this might be guys like there's no limit to what he's saying and that's the you know that's that that is the story but it's if you haven't got and that that's all obviously also the reason why in the early centuries people thought that christianity was so weird or disgusting you know this god is ludicrous what sort of a god gets himself killed you know the gods are supposed to be heroes what do you mean this god is a weak guy from some tiny little town he gets himself killed for no reason um you know that's what's what's heroic about that but that's the the that turns the world on its head that turns everything upside down i mean firstly god comes to earth walks in human form and what do we do we kill him right that's typically human isn't it we laugh at him we ignore him we don't believe him and then we kill him and then we realize afterwards what we've done but the story is that everything that you thought was real it's not real you know christ says you know you know what the gentiles do they get power by lording it over everybody else but we get power by serving people and that's just turn that does turn the old world on its head yeah it's a radical notion and as you say all of us regularly daily fail to obviously actually do it but even small gestures towards it if everybody is doing that and if everybody has that as the sacred image that's why the cross fascinates me so much that's the sacred image that's god dying up there because we killed him but he chose to do that because that's that's what we need to do as well that's the story that's the whole story there that sacrifice defeats death and that sacrifice shows us how to live so what are you going to do with that you know exactly once but it's interesting because once you pierce like when you start to pierce the mystery like once you start to actually have a glimpse of what christ is doing and seeing why it had the effect that it did you actually start to realize that reality actually works that way that like the idea that sacrifice was the core of how the world works it's something that has been there for thousands of years it's always been there like sacrifice has always been the the source of reality let's say out of which communities would flow the altar would always be the the most sacred space in the ancient pagan temples because there was something understanding about something and it's almost like as it was a puzzle being played out like there was this puzzle being set in the world and the and people were getting parts of it and parts of it parts of it and then suddenly you see this image of the sacrifice of of christ as the self-sacrifice um and this this idea that christ did it in submission to the father but then giving himself to to those who were his body and you realize wait a minute that's how things work like the the greatest thing you can do as let's say the elements of a of a country like if you want a country to stay united together you have to sacrifice yourself to the higher ideals of that country or else and then you give your strength your your body your your you give your strength to those that are around you those that are below you and that's actually how a country works that if we don't do that then we're not going to be able to to be bound together you can imagine like a father is the same a father the father has to give himself to the to that which is holding the family together and then give his strength and his and his actions down to his children and and to his wife and so it's like wait a minute that's actually how reality works like christ is actually revealing to us a mystery that has been kind of hidden from the beginning and has been kind of the people have been trying to figure out and trying to to embody ritually um and then christ offers you this this solution and then then we don't want to do it because it's painful and it's because it involves denying yourself i mean that's the message right if you if you want to follow me you deny yourself and you pick up your cross and nobody wants to deny yourself and in this culture if it is culture that we have in the west now we glorify the self the self is everything the ego is everything we're narcissists we want stuff um if we don't have i mean this is the whole the entire capitalist economy is built on fulfilling the whims of the self right you have a need probably one that's created for you by an advertising company the need is then met by selling you some crap that will be thrown into the sea um and that's the self if you deny yourself none of that matters if you deny yourself you're living a small and simple and humble life which is also the solution to this ecological crisis because if we were living small and simple and humble and selfless lives we wouldn't have one right because any community that actually does that as you say a community a country or family they all work by everybody having to at least to some degree deny themselves and also that's how you live well with the rest of creation you deny yourself you don't destroy the forest for toilet roll because you understand that the forest is you know has a right to be there too and you have to live in some harmony with it for your own sake as well as for the sake of everything else so you take what you need but you don't take any more you know because you're not you're not in it for yourself and it's such it's as you say no none of us wants to do that but we're also in a society now which is predicated on glorifying the self rather than denying it so it's harder than it's ever ever been we even talk about that as a realistic thing to want to do as soon as just weird you know you're a weird marginal figure if you want to even think about denying yourself now yeah but every time you do it and it gets fascinating because you you can see the fruits like i keep joking about that but how 50 years ago or even in the 60s we couldn't see the fruits of their the project we couldn't see it but now we have the fruits and so you can notice that let's say if you're a father and you deny yourself and you give yourself to god and then your body and your strength to your children and your attention to your children then you're gonna actually find yourself because your family is going to function and in that self-denial you're gonna find love and joy that you didn't think was possible whereas if you try to just preserve yourself and you live for your own passions and your own desires then you're going to find yourself in a shattered family in a in a divorce court you know fighting over the the who gets the kids and you end up in this world of absolute chaos being ripped apart by reality um and all of this because you all you wanted to do is hold on to your own desires and your own and your own whims so it actually ends up being it's like it's not just like deny yourself and you know you know the whole world's gonna be better it's actually deny yourself and your life's gonna be better too like no joke it's not just it's uh even if you you enter into suffering that suffering will bring you a sense of meaning and purpose and communion that you didn't have when you were just thinking about how to get your get off or to get your own little pleasure no yeah quite i mean there's that's and there's a connection there between the zen buddhism i used to practice in christianity because the method you know the the the theology isn't the same the the central claim isn't the same but actually the the notion of the necessity of denying the self and detachment that that's the way to ease your suffering is precisely the same actually you know if you're attached to all of this stuff you're going to lead yourself into hell and you're going to lead the world into hell as well but as as i say the whole of the modern economy that we have now the whole world that we've built in the west and increasingly elsewhere it can't allow that worldview to be real it has to tell us the story that glorifying ourselves will make us happy but as you say we've you know the evidence is in you know it's been a 60 year or 70 year or 100 year trial period in which we just break everything down and economically and culturally and socially we just kind of go for broke and take what we want and mysteriously enough it doesn't work you know there might be a reason why every society up until this point in history had had a kind of a structure and a sense of the divine and a need to make sacrifice to others yeah so we've got a we've kind of got a painful path back i think and we won't go back to the same place but actually the teaching if the teaching is there and we're following it it's going to take us somewhere where we you know we're going to be presented with we're being presented with ruins that's what's happened everything is being ruined we're changing the climate we're driving species into extinction our culture is disintegrating we'd like you say we've got rates of suicide and depression that are through the roof we've got family breakdown we've got all of this stuff most people aren't really happy with it you can get a lot of instant gratification in absolutely everywhere you want but by the time you're 30 that's getting pretty boring if not before so what have you got what have you got and the more people that can see this and the more accelerated it gets the more people are going to realize that there's there's an eternal truth that you have to go looking for and like you say i think a load of people are i mean they've been doing that for a long time but i think now there's a kind of real acceleration in something in that turn back to oh hang on if we look at it from the right angle this message was there all along we just didn't really see it so then you've got to work out what to do with that which is kind of what i'm still doing probably lifetime's work yeah listen i i really appreciate our conversation um and i i appreciate i appreciate to know that you're on this this path with with us i would say when i say us i mean i can really notice there's this strange movement about and there's this this things are moving and strings are changing and so uh and so i'm happy to to see you on the path with with all of us and i hope to to find reasons to collaborate very soon well that would be great i've appreciated it yeah and then i'll definitely finish reading reading your novel and maybe move on to others and we can have another discussion which will be actually more focused on what you've written so that might be fun as well well there's a lot of options there yeah see if you can get to the end of it first all right we'll do that all right thanks for coming along okay take care
