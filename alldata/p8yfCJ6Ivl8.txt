twitch band gambling those are three words I thought I'd never be able to say but with the kind of weak twitch has been having I guess I shouldn't say I'm surprised I mean they've been having more drama than a Spanish soap opera I mean scams gambling covering up this feels like the world's worst game of prison Bingo literal crimes have been admitted to here and then three seconds later nobody cares because somehow something bigger has happened so look as much as I want to believe that twitch has had a crisis of conference here I think the most logical explanation is that twitch it just feels like they're in the middle of some kind of a scam criminal drama hurricane so they're just looking for something anything to make them look like they have control of this situation I mean because honestly right now they look like children trying to Pilot a spaceship like let's push this button and see what it does oh we banned one of our biggest streamers so we're gonna go over twitch's statement on their gambling ban and basically the start of it goes over their widespread gambling problem the site has had and basically what they plan to do on it interestingly they seem to kind of admit that their old system wasn't working they say gambling content on Twitch has always been a big topic of discussion and something we've actively been reviewing since our last policy update in this area so the full lore on this if you've been a long time time subscriber is basically this isn't the first time twitch has been criticized for this we've actually personally been through a twitch gambling Arc remember a year ago mudahar and I teamed up to defeat the gambling meta on Twitch and uh and we failed because I mean okay yes everybody left rubette right Steve will do it stopped gambling for like a week and then everybody moved over to steak and you know it was even bigger than I mean basically we converted everyone to from beer to cerveza right it was like the same thing different name anyways around that time twitch issued a statement because they were getting so much heat about this whole gambling thing and you know ruining people's lives because the stories in gambling addiction are so horrific so they had to do something so twitch announced that they're going to ban affiliate codes which basically meant the biggest streamers couldn't directly link their affiliate codes on these gambling websites and make even more money uh but this did basically nothing because of course you can just find the code two seconds you know it's not hard so so now slots are basically bigger than ever this year sites like steak are pumping in millions tens of millions to get the top streamers to gamble on their website like basically people like xqc and train wrecks are full-time Casino employees essentially and basically they're part of the reason that slots are now a top 10 category on Twitch literally they've had like 45 million watch hours just this month and I know that number just seems impossibly huge so let's compare to this fortnite got a similar number of watch hours this month too so yeah twitch's efforts to curb gambling content or whatever worked about as well as shooting a squirt gun at a house fire and I guess they seem to kind of acknowledge this when they say some people circumvented those roles and exposed our community to potential harm like yeah no duh people circumvented this role so twitch is basically saying like Okay No More Mr Nice platform they're going to take a harder stance and uh they actually did in a weird twist they decided to ban slots Dice and roulette and are banning all the biggest crypto casinos I mean this is big news guys steak roll bet dual Bits And even rubette who of course we've talked about I mean this is a ballsy move by twitch especially the fact they named daddy steak first I mean they know exactly who's putting the big dollars into their platform um and they know who's gonna affect the most like for context stake is a billion dollar organization they're huge they sponsor the UFC but one of their biggest like marketing vectors this whole time has been that twitch slots section where they had the biggest streamers just working for them like 18 hours a day you know serving up that hot gambling content so this is a big move by twitch to just cut it off right there like name the platform and be like nope that's not happening anymore I heard that Aiden Ross is already sending out resumes so rip to him but either way I don't want to make this sound like it's the full permaband I mean there are things not included here like poker isn't going away neither is sports betting or like fantasy sports uh which you know is probably because most people see them as less harmful forms of gambling and researchers say that they're less likely to addict people um and I think twitch kind of has a point here right like poker is a game invented thousands of years ago or hundreds I don't actually know but slots is like literally the results of humans sitting in a research centers and like tinkering how do we mix the perfect dopamine cocktail for your brain right there's actually a great book on this called addiction by Design where it just goes over how every part of a slot is made to like hook your brain on it from the second you sit down I mean don't get me wrong you definitely can be addicted to like these like lesser forms of it but I I think it's not very arguable that slots are the most important potent form of gambling we currently have so I guess the logic here is that they're not going you know full black and white they're just kind of drawing the line at poker and sports betting and look let's see perfect no but it gets a legitimately Good Start compared to like what they've done in the past which is basically nothing and I know it's going to anger some people you know who are going to come in and say you know what about personal responsibility they have a point to this and I want to address that because I'm all for individual accountability at the individual level like if you're addicted yes you have to take personal accountability no one's going to get you out of your situation but when we're talking about a platform right that argument goes out the window because you know who doesn't talk about personal accountability when it comes to gambling steak.com at no point in their revenue share meetings are they talking about like oh darn it you know people are just taking too much personal accountability we're losing Revenue here no they think of people as statistics as they should at their level they know you know if you we want to pay xqc 10 million dollars a year this is how many people we need to get on our site and that percentage of people we know exactly how many people are going to spend a hundred dollars we know exactly how what percentage of people are going to get addicted and Etc et cetera et cetera they don't view things at the individual level because they're a platform that would make no sense in fact the only time gambling sites talk about personal accountability is when it suits them in the Press right when it absolves them like of course the people selling addiction want to talk about how it's your job to not get addicted and again like are they wrong at the individual level they're not that is the only way to solve individual problems but if the way to solve individual problems is at the individual level what is the way to solve a platform-wide problem well it's at the platform level and that's what twitch is finally doing I mean you can't just ignore the fact your platform is the gateway drug for a lot of people to get addicted to gambling forever you know and believe me Twitch has tried to ignore this uh but they just can't anymore so I definitely think this is a step in the right direction um but maybe most importantly no definitely most importantly this is a huge win for coffeezilla shareholders some of you guys have stuck with me an entire year when we fought this gambling meta and uh to finally come out of on top no thanks to me by the way because we haven't talked about it in a while but you guys stuck in with me some of you invested pumped the stock pre the rubette investigation split of 2021 I mean your stock your Dividends are Sky High and you know what uh you deserve it okay seriously though thanks to everyone who supported the content I mean I don't say that enough uh but while reflecting whenever things change like this it is kind of amazing how much we've grown and um I don't take it for granted thank you guys so much for watching
