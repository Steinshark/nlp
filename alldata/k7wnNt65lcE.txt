we were thinking you hope you're so cool if we tried to overclock at the North Pole but the North Pole is very cold very far away but what isn't is our environmental test chamber with the ability to go all the way from 180 degrees Celsius to negative 40. we can test everything from your Nan's cookie recipe to a computer at the North Pole so let's see just how fast a PC can go at negative 40 degrees and uh if it can even survive what will survive is this Segway to our sponsor build Redux are you in the market for a new rig Pick Your Parts and let build Redux take care of the rest with competitive pricing compared to building a PC yourself build Redux will have your dream rig shipped to your door ready to do all kinds of computery things so check them out at the link down below before we can take the chamber down to negative 40 degrees and Chuck a PC in it we first need to heat it up see here's the thing at -40 condensation is going to be a really big problem and although in the near future we're going to have humidity control in our environmental chamber we don't yet have the air compressor that's required for us to do that so instead what we can do is just heat the chamber up to remove all the moisture from the air and then cool it down now since we needed to have the chamber heated up anyway we were curious what was the performance of a PC look like if you were to take it out of a comfortable room temperature oh that's spicy fast fast put it oh sorry sorry I'm putting it down I'm putting it in and put it at an insane 49.4 degrees Celsius the all-time Canadian record for highest temperature recorded in Litton two years ago let's get this thing hooked up I did not Orient it correctly so yeah we also need cables and stuff that's the whole thing okay let's do it I mean that'll probably do right we can just take the squid over there yeah we got this we also need to go we can't just go straight in we need to go over this down do a loop and then in the reason for that is that not now but later we have a lot of potential for condensation to form around here and potentially drip down our cables and we don't want it to get onto anything that matters we want it to just drip down here around the floor this bucket okay so this poor computer is running at 50 degrees right now oh shut up there's a whole like web interface for it that I mean that makes sense but yeah so you can fully control it from here program in routines and stuff and also see like oh we opened the door there and we opened the door there wow it actually loses less temperature than I would have thought yeah it wasn't too bad our poor CPU is sitting at 75 degrees right now doing nothing and what's really wild is that these temperatures aren't even unrealistic if you lived in one of the hottest regions in India for example you could see temperatures close to this on a fairly regular basis in the summer what's our what's our planned load like should I just send a bench it real quick instant thermal throttle and our poor CPU is running at a mere 4.14 4.13 I mean it's well above base clock which is kind of impressive oh it did a burn-in test okay okay let's see we're at 4.02 3.99 man what's everything else looking like surprisingly the motherboard vrms are still very reasonable good job gigabyte I guess GPU idling at 52 which is impressive when it's sitting in a 50.6 degree celsius chamber wow dipped as low as 3.94 3.93 that explains why the motherboard vrms aren't getting hot oh yeah there's no power they're not pushing any power through them now that we've heated up our CPU let's get an actual score for reference I would expect 36 000 on a computer like this we are not getting 36 000 sir I will eat my sandal if we get 36 000 33 000 points but how will Nvidia fare for Mark you want to do fur marketing yeah for Mark oh my God uh I want to run like 2560 by 1440. that's pretty good for stress tests Forex anti aliasing go now what we're looking at on an Nvidia GPU is not the temperature because it's not going to go over 80 85 Degrees they're hard Limited what we're looking at is the effective clock speed because they will just Throttle Down their performance to match whatever they can do within that thermal Target it's doing pretty well it's doing pretty well so far the one time that 4090 cooler is needed that fan is running at 90 though we can't hear it over all the sound around us but that thing must be freaking ripping okay I want to know can I crack it yeah can I crack it just to hear it okay come on come on whoa she's going it's hard to tell but she's definitely going it's not in real time so it might take a minute or two to show up but yeah we lost uh bit here wow Alex our fan speed isn't even a hundred percent this thing is handling it this is how we had a whole plan for this video where we were going to show like dog slow performance at 50 degrees on the GPU and then we were going to ramp it down to like you know the average Arctic temperature in Canada negative 40 and show how it's like yeah it's doing it what the heck okay these coolers are so overspeced hold on a second 40 90 specs Founders okay this isn't a Founders card this is um looks like yeah it's an Asus strix card but realistically they're all gonna have fairly similar environmental condition ratings I cannot find any reference to a safe environmental operating temperature for the RTX 4090. I guess we're off the rails for the rest of this video all right I want to take this down to minus 40. it does kind of make sense that it can do this because if you think about like a computer case you might expect it to be in 35 degrees you're pumping 450 watts into it for a while if the airflow isn't too great right inside of the case it might be getting to 56 very well be 510 degrees over ambient but good freaking job Asus geez flipping gears then modern CPUs particularly from Intel don't even operate at Peak efficiency at room temperature so we are expecting ah yes a very very different outcome almost immediately we dropped from 200 Watts down to 190 and the lower that power consumption is the less of our total potential performance that we're getting it's already dropped a full gigahertz of clock speed that is one billions of clock speed oh wow yeah this is still dropping we can give it a tiny bit longer sure now you said that until we have our compressed air set up here we are not going to be able to control humidity I mean obviously for wetting the air we've got this water tank so I guess the compressed air plays a role in drying the air yeah the compressed air goes into these desiccant chummies right here okay so there you get dry air out all good I see so it'll basically go oh no it needs to be wetter so it needs to be drier that's pretty much it but you need quite a bit of pressure and a lot of CFM to blast all the air through so we need a big air compressor got it this seems to be settled in we went from an average clock speed of 4.7 gigahertz all the way down to 3.55 and our power is down from over 200 watts to just 160. now it's time to pull our temperature down to the average Arctic temperature in the winter here in Canada okay I hear her doing something hey buddy you okay in there now there's a lot of leakage so that's probably just the air blowing past the compressor okay which we can look at ah also in the time they took you to go from over there to here we dropped 10 degrees really I thought you said it was going to take half an hour to pull down I guess it gets harder to pull down once the environmental temperature is higher than what it's trying to do yeah look just wow wow there goes another one they're biting the dust and another one got here yeah sorry okay holy schnikes I underestimated the size of that compressor wait is this a two-stage system it looks like it but no it's not we thought we had two stages of phase change cooling one to cool down the chamber and one to cool down that stage but what we're actually looking at here is a gigantic three and a half horsepower scroll compressor and then a couple of accumulator tanks that seem to play a role in drying the refrigerant so removing any moisture which can't be compressed and also filtering it so that it can operate as efficiently as possible shout out Jake Danes for helping us read the schematics is our CPU seriously still at 100 degrees on a Nocturne hd15 it's actually really confusing because around like 15 degrees Celsius it was doing pretty good and now the clock speeds are dropping and so is the wattage so I wonder if like our thermal paste has frozen oh it's been at 100 degrees the whole time we might have just Frozen our heat pipes uh wait did it just crash welcome back to land of the living the GPU is at negative 16 degrees on the memory I really want to check it for condensation but I don't really want to open up the door and add in a bunch of concentration see this warm air when it touches the cold stuff will immediately have the moisture drawn out of it where it will collect on the cold stuff do we continue with this computer no I think it's time for us to take it to another level this is where things get really spicy because remember that part we mentioned about how when we open it up the warm air condensation Etc we need to find a way to swap components on this bench without destroying it we're going to have to be really fast okay and once it's running through maybe it'll be fine if it's just sitting in there it's going to freeze right I'm so sorry deep cool thank you for sending us your all-in-one liquid cooler I don't know are we just gonna wing it let's just open it up and see what happens we're just gonna wing it oh okay probably minus 35. freaking cold okay this is bad it is condensing already Alex this is very bad yeah that's all also is the computer on right now why is the computer on oh my God it's frosting over it's frosting over already close the door a bit let's get yeah more more and more oh my God it's really bad sorry Andrew you gotta oh my God this is so cold we're just gonna get the hardware after oh this is dead you gotta close it more close it more shoot me through the window just I'm in here I'm in here it's fine okay I need the back plate oh my goodness she's Frosty Alex I can tell where's the other where's the old back plate oh it fell off okay okay you got it I have the old back plate there's the new one yeah oh crap this is bad it's very bad oh it's so cool okay so it's just a second okay I need to hold this back plate on I think yeah there it goes okay good work here we go oh my gosh oh sorry I just elbow you in the head yes oh sorry that's fine okay is it theoretically ready to power up okay we gotta close it Alex you can't organize hardware and a little tray have you gone mad sir uh so the power button's in there oh ball oh God it's at 92 humidity Alex why did we change the cooler I'm just here to hold the door for you um it's content don't blow up my chamber please what we should have done was brought it back up to room temperature then pulled it down again it does appear that Linus was right and there is no more Frost all over our computer our AIO might be frozen but it should be fine you may remember this computer from our direct die cooling video recently well it's still got the same direct dye water block on it but instead of using an industrial Chiller to pump fluid through the loop we're going to be running this inside our air Chiller uh yeah I was wondering about that so instead of using Straight water we are apparently wait is this windshield de-icer or is it glycol perfect I expect some problems problem number the first this doesn't seem like a lot of glycol problem number the second glycol when it reaches certain temperatures gets quite viscous and this is just a PC cooling pump this is not your car's cooling pump have we crossed the line from fun to stupid no what would be stupid is if we didn't use this tray because if the water from our computer gets onto that and they Common Ground we blow up both of them don't worry everything's fine I didn't think it wasn't but now I'm no they're fine I'm that everything's fine I'm leaving in five minutes and now I'm concerned thank you the test chamber will work when you arrive tomorrow oh wow this is just clear antifreeze glow glow glow glow glug wait did we ever plug in the pump for the AIO in there yes but also it's not working so well maybe the pump's working but either way uh we're at 115 Watts right now 100 degrees on the CPU so uh it turns out AIO and uh minus 33 degrees not a good time are you prepared for a very cold looking computer you doing all right yeah wow that's very cold this will need to sit for a solid day or two before it would be safe to fire up at this point even the air inside the CPU socket would have enough moisture in it that left like this it would be a major concern for it to be just pulled up in there how much glycol did you get in there I don't know I have absolutely no way of knowing yeah it'll probably be fine all right it seems like not buying is kind of the theme of this video though all right um that's a lot of liquid metal all right now the crap we're gonna get that on Oh serious okay I guess we haven't actually explained in this video certain thermal compounds will perform worse at lower temperatures and for those of you who are wondering what we are seriously using this equipment for that's actually the closest thing to it out of what you've seen so far is figuring out like validating manufacturers claims about the safe operating temperatures of their equipment okay we going for it yeah yeah this feels like being in an Arctic wind yes come on come on okay oh yes yes yes yes yes we've got output okay so here's the thing when we were using the industrial Chiller obviously actually it has a very similar cooling capacity about 5000 Watts yeah but the chiller is gated it won't go under five degrees on the coolant theoretically with negative 40 degree air our traditional water cooler could go below five degrees we're not expecting it to Simply turn to solid ice immediately but we would hope to notice though is if it was starting to solidify around the edges I think I'm starting to see a little bit of freezing on some of the tubes it might just be external seriously Oh no you're right holy crap that's a problem if it's around the outside it's not too bad I don't think it's inside I don't think it's the outside I think it's the inside how's our CPU doing 100 degrees at the entrance to that radiator there's already ice the wildest thing is that that might have been because of CPU over temperature it was only at like 80 Watts on the CPU and 100 degrees like that could have actually been our problem and I don't know why it can't turn back on do you know it can turn on though xsplit xsplit is used by content creators all over the world to broadcast
