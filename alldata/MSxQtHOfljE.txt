hello everyone and welcome in this video we are talking about what is possibly the fastest shifting transmission out there koenigsegg slight speed transmission we're going to get all into how this transmission actually works now this video is brought to you by Auto tempest comm I'll get more into that later on in the video but as many of you may know I'm going to be replacing my Honda s2000 with something different so I've been using Auto Tempest quite a bit lately as it's an awesome website to look for used cars so the light speed transmission is used in the Koenigsegg Jesco it is a nine forward speed transmission there are seven clutches eight if you count the clutch for the differential this course producing 1600 horsepower on e85 and so I've got drawn the light speed transmission here this is a simplified diagram in order to understand how it works it's not the exact layout of how the gears and everything look and then here on the left we have a simplified that dual clutch transmission with just four speeds and the reason why I drew this is to help illustrate some of the advantages that this light speed transmission has so first let's do a little walkthrough here with this transmission and make sense of it all so we have our engine five litre v8 twin-turbo it is sending that power directly to the input shaft of our transmission so this is all fixed together there's not actually a flywheel all of these gears will kind of rotate with the engine and that is going to be essentially the flywheel now everything drawn here in black is all fixed so all of this is rotating together the colored gears are on bearings so this is on a bearing these three right here on ER on a bearing and these three right here are on bearings and so how this all works is you've got three shafts and then on these shafts you have separate gear pairs so you have compound gears here rather than like in a dual clutch transmission in this case how it's drawn you just have two shafts and then you have each gear pair on those two shafts so here we're sending power first from the engine to this shaft right here it then has the choice between any of three these three gears now each one of these three gears has a clutch pack connected to it so how this works you've got your clutch pack with the gear it's paired with that gear and then the shaft itself can be disconnected or connect with that gear using that clutch so if you close this clutch pack in red right here clutch pack number one that will pair these two gears together and that will force this shaft to rotate this shaft now at the end of this shaft we have three additional fixed gears just like this first Jeff has so for example let's say we lock up this first clutch pack these two here are completely open so power is going to come from the engine to this first gear right here and then over to these three gears and then rotate these three gears now these three gears right here once again each have their own individual clutch pack so they're all rotating individually and you can choose which one you want to send power through so in order to send power to the rear wheels ultimately with any gear you're going to have to close two clutches in the case of forward gears so let's just walk through the example first gear so for first gear we're gonna send that power over to this first little gear right here we've got that aggressive gear ratio we close up this clutch pack right here these are open we then close up clutch pack number four and so then we have an aggressive gear ratio another aggressive gear ratio and that's our most aggressive gear ratio that we could possibly have send that to the rear so we're just closing packs one and for every other clutch pack here will be open so power is going to come across from one down to four and then to the rear wheels for gear number two we open this and we close this and that's all that's required for the gear shift you open one clutch pack you close another clutch pack so power comes across from one down to four instead now down to five if you want third gear you do one and now six and so you can do that for each gear pair so you've got nine total speeds using six gear sets so let's say we want to then shift from third to fourth well we're going to open up one and six and then we're going to close two and four so now we're going our two here and then power to here and then if we want to go to fifth or sixth gear instead of going to four we go over to five we go over to 6 and then fergie r--'s seven eight and nine same thing you open up this this one is also open the power comes across over to the third clutch right here and then 2 1 2 2 2 3 so that's six 7:8 so this will be a gears one two and three four five and six seven eight nine depending on which one of these gears you have selected here on this secondary shaft and then for a reverse gear as you can see power is going to come across it's going to switch directions and then it's going to switch back to the original rotation of that first shift if you go through this compound gear now if you just go straight across you will change the direction so for reverse you open up all these clutches and you close clutch number seven that reverses the output chef's direction and you drive backwards wonderful and then just a very quick example of shifting because you can shift from any one gear to any other gear extremely quickly so we're gonna go from ninth to second just to demonstrate that so ninth gear we're in three and six these are both closed everything else is open we want to go to second gear which is one in five so we close we open up three and six and then we immediately close one and five and that puts us in second gear so you're switching to clutches on two clutches off simultaneously and you make that gear change happen extremely extremely fast so how does this compare to a dual clutch transmission so here we have a simplified four-speed generally speaking they're gonna have more than four speeds we're just using this to better understand how it works so we've got two separate shafts on one shaft you have gears one and three on the second shaft with the second clutch you have gears two and four now I've just drawn single clutches here to simplify it generally speaking in a dual clutch these are going to be wet multi-plate clutches and same with all of these clutches these are all going to be wet multi-plate clutches so you know that's just a durability thing makes them last quite a long time if they're bayed than oil and there's multiple discs so here let's say we're in first gear well this blue clutch is going to be engaged and we're going to be sending power from here to here we have a selector so this color will engage this first gear using the selector fork and we'll send that power from here over to the rear differential so this gear is on a bearing on this secondary shaft and this collar rotates with the secondary chef so they'll mesh together and force power to come across and then to the next gear now say we want a really fast shift to second gear so what we can do because this second clutch is open and not engaged we can actually mess this gear right here and pre-select it using this shifter for it so this shifter fork will force second gear to already be engaged so first is engaged and the clutch is engaged so we're sending power this way this is not engaged this secondary clutch right here and but we've already selected the next gear so all that needs to happen in order for the gear shift to occur is you open that first clutch and you close the second so it's an extremely fast transaction because all you're doing is switching which clutch is engaged and so you'll immediately shift power from that first gear directly over to that second gear so you have an extremely fast shift and you don't have a total loss of torque while you're doing it very cool advantage of dual clutch transmissions now on a track this is wonderful you're never really going to run into many cases where you have to shift multiple times down or multiple times up it's fine to go through each gear individually on a road however that's a much more common occurrence if you floor it on the highway things like that and it also may not guess on a road with the next gear is so want to track it sees your flooring it it knows you're going to up shift on a road it may not know what you're going to do next so it may not know which gear to select so let's say you're in third gear and you want to shift to fourth well it might have selected second because you're on the brakes or let's say you're in fourth gear and you actually want to go down to second gear because you're on the highway and you want to accelerate quickly well obviously because the same color is used for second and fourth it can't pre-select second gear so the gear shift is going to take significantly more time versus with the koenigsegg light speed transmission all that's required at any for any gear shift is simply opening and closing clutches so it's a completely different design as far as how they do it and the major advantage here is that you know not only do you have all of that speed when you're on a track but when you're on a road it doesn't have to do any predicting and if you're on the highway it can shift down quite a bit so you could say it's very good on both Road and track did someone say Road and track well it just so happens that if you take the June issue turn to page 16 you will find an article that I wrote on the koenigsegg Jesco transmission how cool is that so Koenigsegg employs a technology they call you pod ultimate power on-demand with this transmission and simply what that means is so if you're using the gear selectors on the steering wheel or the hand selector in that center column either way there are two notches for that shifter so if you're down shifting let's say you're an eighth gear and you pull it all the way back rather than just one notch one notch will give you one downshift one gear all the way back puts you in the ideal gear for the maximum power so if you're on the highway cruising you want as much power as possible you pull that gear lever back that gear selector back all the way and it puts you in the ideal gear based on what speed you're at and then you just rock it off so lightning quick shift get in that power band of the engine and then just fly so a very cool little system they've incorporated it also works with up shifts so if you want to go to the maximum forward gear basically the most efficient gear at any time you can do so very quickly with that double notch up shift so a neat little technology they've incorporated to take advantage of the fact that this transmission can go from any one gear to any other forward here extremely quickly now how fast you might ask well I asked Koenigsegg the exact same question and their response was pretty incredible they said that these clutches can open and close in as little as two milliseconds and the other very cool thing about that on top of just being insanely fast is that you're never going to lose positive torque as you're working your way up through those gears because let's say you're in first gear right here and then you switch to second gear there's overlap while one clutch is opening and the other is closing and so you never have just completely zero torque you always have positive torque occurring because of that torque overlap as those two clutches switch their positions so very cool that they're able to maintain that some of the other advantages of this transmission of course the size of it so this is part of kind of these compound gears instead of using you know nine gear pairs for nine gears they're using just six skier pairs and you know three shafts and then six gear pairs giving you those nine gear ratios so they're able to make it significantly smaller in fact Koenigsegg that this is less than half the length of the 7-speed transmission used in the Agera and it only weighs 90 kilograms so that's with all the fluids so very compact so small in nature and also not that heavy so very cool and then of course the other obvious Vantage advantages of the shift speed and the shift flexibility being able to go from any one here to any other gear extremely fast now what might be the disadvantages well of course this is a very low volume transmission they're just building 125 just goes so as a result cost of course is going to be high but I think the people buying a Jesco probably know that the other part when I look at this I think about is efficiency because you know let's say you're in first gear and you've got 1 & 4 open well that means you've got these 5 or 1 in 4 clothes well that means you've got these 5 other gears with their clutches open so that's you know some heat loss that you're gonna have associated with all of those open clutches you've got all these gears so of course you know it's not going to be as efficient as something like Koenigsegg Agera where you have a direct drive and you're using a hybrid system to kind of fill the gap whereas in this case there is no hybrid you need to have years in order to get that engine in its happy range versus the Ruggero just using that direct drive extremely efficient and then using electric motors to fill the gap where the engine can't produce you know that insane wheel torque because of its gear ratio now many of you have asked what am I going to be replacing the Honda s2000 with and again a huge thank you to Otto tempest comm for sponsoring the video the truthful answer to this question is I don't know that said there are definitely things that I do want it to be I'd prefer it of course to have a manual transmission I think I do want it to be rear-wheel drive and then aside from that I'm kind of open to it so I've been looking at the newer Miatas which I think are really awesome perhaps an older m3 which I also think are really cool however I never have actually driven one I've also been looking at the 370's Z's because they've really come down in price this cars been around forever and I do actually really like the steering in that course what is something that I am a fan of but that said again I am not totally sure what I'm going to end up with regardless Otto tempest is incredible tool for looking at used cars that compiles all the different search results from the major used car websites out there so we'll include a link to that in the video description if you are interested thank you all so much for watching and if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave them below
