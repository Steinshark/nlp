in 2022 you either die a hero or live long enough to sell nfts that's the new youtuber life cycle and today we get the rare chance to see the final form of the greedy influencer that's right the legendary doubleless downus i'm of course talking about jake tran's recent response jake tran is a youtuber who spent years exposing evil businesses but now has been doing the same things that he accuses others of and last week i showed how he had started selling nfts in videos about how bad nfts are we're selling crypto in a video about how crypto is and it was just so weird to watch it felt like your high school counselor was suddenly trying to sell you drugs right after a dare presentation i mean on the one hand it's so shameless it's funny on the other hand it's very gross now soon after this video came out jake got backlash from his community and he finally responded to all the accusations and honestly i'm surprised i was expecting a response somewhere along the lines of either i didn't know it was a scam or it's not a scam but he didn't even try that what did you expect out of a channel that teaches you to be evil lol now i'll be honest i clearly was fooled i thought his whole series on evil business videos were exposed but apparently it's a big to-do list like i think jake saw this all as a big wikihow he's the type of guy to think that the wolf on wall street is like a checklist and not a cautionary tale you know on the one hand i do really appreciate the honesty of this but on the other much more important hand uh you're kind of admitting that you don't care if your audience gets scammed by you which it seems really wrong now that being said i'd at least respect it if he fully committed to the villain arc but jake softens it in the next paragraph and says in all seriousness i put my heart and soul into making free premium videos every sponsor on this channel helps fund this channel so we can keep upping the quality and quantity so if you don't like the sponsors skip the ads don't buy from them or unsubscribe from the channel so basically he's not sorry he had to do the scam ads to keep up with the quantity and quality of his videos but i don't know if i really buy this to be honest i mean look i like jake tran videos but let's not pretend they cost a fortune to make he literally uses b-roll from other people's movies for his visuals and then he farms out his research to like articles and wikipedia maybe a book or two so this whole thing about like i had to do these ads otherwise i couldn't possibly produce this quantity and quality of videos it's like my guy you barely make your videos as it is your visuals are from filmmakers you're snagging their clips for fair use and then lately he's been farming out even the voice over of his work which it's like i'm not against that but pretending you're making some oscar-winning documentaries that require our blood money to fund is a little bit much and then there's also the thing about like hey just don't click it if you don't like it just unsubscribe but i don't think jake realizes that this undermines every single one of his videos because why would you complain about tobacco or dupont or any of these evil businesses when they could just turn around and say the same thing like hey if you don't like it don't buy it unsubscribe why are you buying our cancer sticks right like which would obviously be missing the point but is the exact same argument and this isn't even to mention the fact that jake tran isn't a soulless corporation at least not yet but rather is a youtuber with some level of accountability to his audience and that all makes the next part of his response even more confusing he says i love all of you more than any of you could realize you changed my life in every way possible uh okay i don't know what to do with this like nothing in these two paragraphs seems to have anything to do with the other they're diametrically opposed like unsubscribe if you don't like the scam ads i'm running but also i love you very much i don't know if i buy this i mean i'm sure his life did change but um i think he's happier about the money part of the equation clearly jake finally ends the response i apologize for nothing uh stay dangerous so he's not sorry uh all of you who got ripped off just in case you are wondering if you felt any bit of remorse the answer is no and i'm assuming he's one of these guys who thinks apologizing on the internet is like having your pants pulled down in front of the whole class it's the worst thing that could happen to you and maybe that's true for some influencers but if you're the guy exposing corruption you can't just like shrug off being corrupt yourself it destroys your whole appeal and i think this just highlights a problem that i have with jake's general mentality like i may be wrong about this but i think he thinks that being a little bit evil is like necessary and important to survive in this world in fact that's sort of the point of his entire stay dangerous sign off he said before that this is the purpose of his channel and even quotes machiavelli to suggest that you can't be a good guy and that has become the purpose of this channel to expose how this world of power really works to help you navigate this world to level out the playing field for the powerless to help you become more dangerous because as machiavelli once said any man who tries to be good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who are not good so there it is he just says it like his job is to make you more dangerous i guess by selling you scammy nfds um but it's pretty clearly and heavily implied that like being good and doing things the right way is like a suckers game uh it's a loser's bet which obviously i really disagree with i think jake thinks he's found the red pill of life and i just kind of feel bad for him for that because i'm almost positive this is going to backfire on him in a big way but i don't know maybe that's my naive perspective i have seen a lot of influencers just getting away with scamming their audience and they just don't care so maybe we're in a new world but uh in my opinion you know you can get ahead in the short term by cheating a little selling out your audience but once you get that reputation it sticks and all in all i think it was a pretty terrible response uh maybe like a three out of ten that's basically it see ya
