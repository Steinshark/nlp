ladies and gentlemen welcome back to your favorite series on the internet guess the ELO if you're a new viewer then welcome it's so nice to have you and if you're a returning viewer and you've been watching for a long time my condolences I'm actually very very sorry in this series friendly reminder five games submitted to me while I'm live on Twitch by my subscribers I analyze the game from start to finish and then I try to guess what the ELO of the players is and also what chess.com thinks it is because now chess.com has a ratings estimating feature now today's episode is historic why is it historic because I needed a new title because I'm like 70 titles into this series but also the last game of today's episode my subscriber claimed this has never happened in a guess the ELO before frankly I don't remember so it's up to you guess the ELO detectives find if the conclusion of the last game of the last episode today has ever happened before in guess the ELO or not enjoy E4 C6 D4 D5 you can also hi to YouTube now Pawn takes Knight takes tartak hour Bishop D3 actually Bishop D3 is a is a is a Gambit but I think white just lost the pawn I think white just forgot that that pawn is not guarded what all right I don't know what the heck Knight G4 is all about I don't know I never I never taught you all to play no Knight G4 um what does this even do like is there a okay that's not a problem oh okay night wow I I would do this now and Fork these two pieces beautiful trade the Queens trade the Knight for the bishop develop all your pieces okay don't like that move but also don't hate it alright now you gotta take you got no choice oh my goodness oh my God oh my God why okay why is this a bad move fundamentally what is wrong with the movie five it doesn't quite lose a pawn right now there's nothing technically wrong with it but in the long run for your chest development this is a terrible move you are opening up the center with your King still there and unless black gets the castle in right away black is gonna get obliterated all right just it's a bad habit to create yeah now you got oh my God now you take and you don't even take the right piece please Castle yeah see now like I knew it now now there's all sorts of problems you got all sorts of problems oh my God and you lose immediately why is this losing Bishop takes Knight Bishop takes Knight why you take with the Knight you lose your rug if you take with the King you get right into the way of this exactly what I said I knew when the movie five happened this is why it's guess the ELO is good when it's funny but guess the ELO is also good because it's instructional because look at black is just completely negated black is reacting move by move to everything oh Bishop okay me attack and white does this and even though that's not the best move it's still very good because if there's this and if this D6 is hanging and if this then you know Rook D6 no not only not Rook D6 you also hang your own Bishop why is it so bad by the way is it just because you take the bishop and you're just better no you don't even take the bishop you go Rook d8 okay okay that was a complete accident I would like you all to know right now hand to God that black had no idea that was the top engine move all right black had absolutely no idea okay Knight F2 now black castles like if 12 moves too late F5 okay fine okay I'm terrified I have no idea that's a great move and now now it's gonna be Rook D2 and it's going to be Bishop F4 all right I can predict the future with low ELO chess low ELO players react to things in one move rookie two is a fantastic move and I know for a fact white is gonna go here trying to trade this there it is and now Bishop F4 beautiful stuff takes takes okay that's a bad move you should double up the Rooks on the second rank but this is not bad don't disconnect your oh gorgeous technique yup okay the fact that black played King to G7 in this position and did not see Rook takes Pawn gotta be like 700 okay 6 to 700 if even all right like I'm saying mid 600s I feel like if you played now they took but like what on Earth is King G7 I mean and now now the moves went back to normal oh my gosh the opening was real weird the opening was real weird no no black just won there was no stalemate black just one of course white should not resign here um yeah I'm gonna say like 700. 700. so so I think I think I think 700 but I mean the opening I mean they knew the charge that Knight G4 is a crazy move and just a lot a lot of bad decision making here I would say like 700. hopefully High 700 750 you guys feeling generous why should be like a thousand I mean like honestly for all these memes what should be a thousand it's not Gotham Chess By the way wow it's 900 versus 10 14. that's tough good Lord really it was a 30 minute game too or yeah all right I did not like this was a very scatter brain game um night G4 is a weird move that that this is an overthinking of the position I guess you kind of have to know what you're doing I guess black was trying to you know and Knight H3 is insane for a 900 to play night night H3 like you guys have to understand when I do guess the low I'm guessing it off of certain things I'm guessing enough the fact that white plague Knight H3 Knight H3 is not a good move it's just not all right and then you know this was all right but like not taking on D7 was a little bit wild and then not taking the bishop was a little bit wild so right all right not not the worst thing in the world but uh you know a little mellow start here a little mellow start all right please pick my game okay no worries I will totally pick your game after going through every single game that has already been chosen and then completely ignoring your message um Knight F3 why is Gotham so mean to the viewers sorry I was preparing myself for the comments uh Knight F3 are ready wow 25 okay I was gonna say that white is like really high rated and then black went here there is nothing terribly wrong with the move d4 um it's just the fact that it when you just March a lone Pawn into your opponent's position they can just trade it like that's just the thing and I mean you could try to hang on to it but you're probably gonna lose it and if this you have things like Knight D4 and you've already lost the pawn and if Queen D4 you lose much more than a pawn all right so anyway D3 all right okay oh God now you definitely don't bump us on here I I know okay black does it of course Queen D3 now yup punishing immediately yeah you don't really want to give away the bishop for the night but whatever Queen this oh sound the alarm oh on the board on the board on the board on the board take the night oh gorgeous yup no okay how many points do we deduct from the estimate for what okay any intermediate player gets the other Rook into the game here right my 1500s in the chat my 1500s on YouTube You Gotta Go Rook fd1 right I mean the person going here has got to be like 1100 I mean right because because you're already out you haven't moved that Rook yet right I mean that's that's a big piece of info 95 is good though oh my God oh my oh my oh my God oh my God now Bishop C3 and then you could take the Knight oh but for black to find that I mean that's craziness oh this is tough Rook C1 wait they are playing really well okay okay how did you just do all of that and now you won't even come home the Knight is dancing around and now the first move it has to escape you move the Rook why why oh my God you're just not escaping okay thank you now you're escaping oh my God you hung your Bishop wait I'm sorry what what on Earth man oh it's a draw oh you're winning oh my God oh my God I thought it was perpetual oh my God I thought it was Perpetual oh oh God that was very tricky you couldn't take because you were gonna lose the Rook wow and you lost your Rook and you lost your Rook anyway and I feel like someone's gonna lose but I don't know who okay black stop the promotion yes of course instead of moving the a pawn down the board we move our King because I don't know reasons A4 thank you A3 what the why for what reason are we going what are you worried about this okay there is no chance in a million years you even saw that this was a fork or you thought that this was just winning okay you didn't see that all right you did you this is luck it's all luck oh oh God and and the worst part is the bishop Cuts everything now just King B3 and push the pawn I mean the the bloodlust to give a second to give a check for absolutely no reason and now the only thing you can do is go here and of course and of course you don't and of course you don't and of course you don't and now it's over now it's a draw oh my god there was Bishop H6 oh my god there was Bishop H6 oh my God it was over oh oh oh I don't know 1050. 1100 Max 1100 bags absolute Max it's like a thousand there's no way this

goodness oh my God that was amazing great game I learned a lot game three all right I selected this game myself because uh I saw the preview of this game I saw the first five moves of this game in the Discord before I chose this game uh you guys are about to laugh a lot are you ready Vienna Gambit right by the way free sample of the E4 course 100 free sample you don't have to spend any money it's on chestley under E4 course this is covered okay and this is covered which is something that a lot of people play at intermediate level white goes here okay now in the Vienna black can either do this or this or they lose their Knight okay sounds good black cannot go forward so in this game Black Goes forward that's game over right that's game over white goes here losing the game to Queen H4 check by the way as a side note I mean folks I literally okay you know that saying you can bring a horse to water but you can't get it to drink all right not only are you not a horse and instead you are mules I literally threw you in a lake okay and you still died of thirst you were in a lake of water okay you could have drank water by accident and you still won't drink okay it's not a matter of bringing you to the water I am throwing you into a lake and you still refuse to drink the water Knight to E4 is yeah okay as they say all right oh my God Knight C5 oh love it Knight F3 okay do you know how white played the move Bishop F4 this is a massive problem that you guys have you go like this this is the way you guys play chess okay um this is what you do you play chess like this you go oh I'm gonna take pawn and you do this right and you're like oh wait I can't do that and while this is still open okay while this is still on you go oh if I go there I get taken so I'm gonna go there what just because you highlighted a piece doesn't mean you got to move it what is it what even is Bishop D2 why first of all get the knights out first all right just in general good rule of thumb get the knights out first Knight F3 second of all go D5 you don't gotta Play Bishop D2 yeah now you just okay oh my oh my nah nah bro oh oh get him oh get him oh okay get his ass get his ass that's it that's the whole game um [Music] foreign that's my ambulance impression you like that um wow ah 300. 300 I mean listen we've all been there not me but you guys uh 300 gotta be right that's crazy that's crazy no no nah no no no 633 570 no guys no this is not good no I don't even come on dudes you guys gotta get better at tactics oh goodness what does chess.com think oh God I don't even I'm terrified what does chess.com think honestly can do we have to look I'm gonna look chess.com thought that white was 350. by the way I said that all right can I give myself some credit chess.com says white is 350. shotgun thinks black is a hundred the only thing below 100 is Danny wrench's face so I'm gonna take a little credit because I said 300. it's straight up things black like just made an account and lost 20 games in a row that's tough all right Gotham Sub in game five of today's episode is playing with black and okay is playing a Caro even though it's not an E4 opening always love that good good good good oh E5 oh Sensational wow oh great heavens oh that's a terrible move I want to see E4 lock the door ah it's not how you should play chess okay um of course the bishop should go here okay if you're gonna develop the bishop anywhere that's what you should do you should also lock the center why because the person that wants to attack you might not even know you want to attack but you should attack the person who wants to attack uh one's a close Center okay that's what they want to do so H6 is a very good move uh H5 and so on it's all reasonable stuff um yeah okay Bishop B4 just doesn't cut it and neither does that but now your opponent because they absent-mindedly chased your Bishop got you into a good position F4 okay just judging from the complete inability for either side to capture a Central Pawn I'm saying like 700. okay because noobs noobs you all have this problem you just forget you can take Central pawns I don't know why you just put them out there and then you just forget they can take each other like this is like this is actually insane like what the hell is going on okay well you did that to yourself oh my God long Castle oh my God F5 what the hell what nah this is a fake game Bishop bro if I find out this is a fake game I'm gonna be so mad let's just make Queen A6 Queen B7 just just Queen A6 Queen B7 what I don't unders like what are I'm getting mad like I'm getting I didn't get mad at the other people the other people were noobs I feel like y'all are just deliberately not playing the best moves and that what is this guys what what is this come on man is this a real game I mean that guys I'm sorry but I mean can you imagine you like played a bad game of chess and the streamer thinks it's fake like that's how bad the game was I mean this is a bad game it's not even bad that you were making bad moves okay last game that I just looked at they were making bad moves but they you know they were noobs all right they were kind of following up to you know logically guys it literally feels like you were playing right you were playing Russian roulette and every piece got a turn agent no move made sense together like you sacked to open the queen and then you go here that's crazy oh God yeah but the opening was fine I mean my god um I don't know 500. 500. I mean if it's gonna be like two eighteen hundreds obviously a fake game right so I'm gonna say 500 maybe they're actually 500 it happens you know we were all been 500 I mean I haven't but you know I just want to make you feel bad um 500. 400 and Black's rating is 500 on the DOT 500 literally on the DOT yeah it really kind of feels like they played this game and and that and a dice was rolled every time somebody had to make a move literally I mean good good Lord folks okay uh and what does chess.com think you are I'm terrified of this chess.com thinks you are 250 and 350. yeah that's you know guys what happened here can I just like like what y'all played a normal AF opening like what was this I mean this was crazy normal then okay nah you know what like this was fine and then y'all just stop making any logical moves maybe that's what oh my God and black got a brilliant oh my God black got a brilliant tremendous that was a that was an insane game y'all that was an insane game and you know the way you're supposed to learn in chess while the way I would recommend learning in chess and you should listen to me because I understand the mind of a chess beginner um is uh you know you gotta find a way to take something more generally out of this game so more generally black you you both have massive first of all stop pushing pawns where you Castle completely stop doing that right now all right second of all uh you cannot just have a massive blind spot for the center you gotta clarify the center take something push something all right after that more General stuff is uh look at the most valuable captures because if you saw Pawn takes H3 you obviously saw that and uh yeah I mean beyond that I mean I don't know I mean beyond that I honestly beyond that just play chess and have fun there is very little general knowledge beyond that I mean like honestly this game was chaos if I could give you any advice it would be minimize chaos in your games literally like I don't know how I'm supposed to do that but you know you both are just completely playing past each other so all right uh this individual submitted a game and claimed that this would be guess the ELO history okay this person claimed that the game that they submitted with black had a finish that has never happened before in guess the ELO history all right we have an Albin counter Gambit and they said that we could permanently ban them after they gave 10 Subs so basically this person said if this is not a historic moment we can they will give 10 subs and then we will permanently ban them they did not say the permanently banned part okay they just said the 10 Subs okay immediately worse because you just play E4 very good now there is a very very neat trap here okay um there's a very famous story uh that I have a clip on on uh on on somewhere on YouTube and it's a story of this trick where you can play E3 f e Queen H4 check and especially in Speed games what is Black's pre-move in this position anytime your opponent is checked and can only block it with a pawn like this you pre-move Bishop E7 why do you in fact you don't even pre-move it what you do is you hover on the bishop like this and you don't pre-move it you like hesitate for like half a second and then you do this and your opponent's like oh what an idiot and then you win now if they don't take your queen you're just worse but you're not like losing but you know you're worse well in this case I guess you are losing but like whatever uh you literally are trying to sack a queen for no reason um so Knight C3 C6 great stuff I love this night yeah beautiful I would play A6 prevent anything from going to B5 wow why okay you messed up H5 is a gigantic gigantic piece of information all right H5 is like showing your opponent in poker one of your cards what do you do here you play a waiting move let them Castle let them Castle okay Castle then you play H5 because your opponent is Never Gonna See Bishop H2 coming and if they play H3 what do you play G5 or Bishop C7 Queen D6 or Bishop F5 Queen D7 and Sack the bishop all right so by going age five your opponent's like oh well I'm just never gonna Castle you understand yeah and you see now your Bishop is kind of cooked yup yup all right oh oh Levi I bought your Carl Concourse okay first of all my name is not Levi second of all you called it a canned course no Caro third of all you said some drills have less moves than the studies that is a feature that is not a drawback all right there is no reason for you to memorize 30 moves of theory unless you are like 2300 so you need to be able to memorize and at the same time you need to be able to explain the concepts it's a little bit less important than doing like a 20 move drill that we did it on purpose I promise all right now if you think there is a place that is drastically drastically under drilled submitted to the support we have a fantastic support team we have course editors all right that was not a roast but he did call me Levi which is very disrespectful um all right rookie eight so again since your opponent is going to Castle you should probably move this Rook there right sorry for wrong name no problem you were 75 correct okay Free Pawn okay may I ask a question why would you point the Bazooka at a wall okay and then Park your own car in front of it like you're gonna shoot uh a bazooka at a wall what you want to shoot it at your own car instead you don't know what I mean by that I don't know what I mean by that all right nobody knows what I mean nobody knows I just say things you know okay do it again um yeah five Knight C5 okay I love this yeah see remember how in the last game the noobs have a blind spot in the center of the board and it's Pawns do I not have mods no I do let me show you hold on um so yeah intermediate players have a blind spot for center pieces if you're playing white here you should take why because it enables this move it enables that move and if Knight C5 there's Queen C2 and all this stuff right um You don't want to just go here and lose in the Knight but intermediate players just like shove pieces into the center and then those pieces get taken and then they take a rook and hang a queen right well uh this is bad so you said this has never happened in guess the ELO history and what might that be uh oh okay okay that's actually interesting okay okay I feel like I'm looking at a double rainbow a little smothered mate action smothered made action well someone's gonna have to find it because there's 70 episodes by the way black played really well can I just give some props like black played okay H5 was a gross overstepping let your opponent Castle all right before you play H5 um white played fine but yeah then that then I got really ooga like here black just you know black just doing whatever they want but uh but black played well white did not play well but it's very tough to say tough to say because white did not have much all game I'm gonna say like 50 like 15 1600. I'm gonna say 15 1600 and white did not have a good weapon against the album let's see this game 1556 versus 15.99 and I said 15 1600. because he's the guy that got included in the E4 course I have no idea but you know who does the website and the table of contents which is publicly listed on the website good night
