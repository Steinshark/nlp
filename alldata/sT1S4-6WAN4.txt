this elon musk cryptocurrency just went on national television to tell people their grannies should invest their life savings into it what gives you the confidence that someone should for instance bring their grandmother in it with their life savings we have the huge community behind us so you know think about the utility we're the only token out there that has a board of advisory you know like you know that came into crypto have never been part of the project that actually see the beneficial side of this wow that's awful and it gets so much worse there's some amazing moments in here like people in lab coats that are doing nothing rocket ships that don't work but the real question is how did we get here on fox business channel shilling an obvious scam telling grandma to invest well what you're looking at is elon goat token and to understand how it came about you have to understand that there's a new type of human being out there whose entire personality and career is made out of loving and or hating elon musk you probably have seen these people they can't shut up about the fact that elon musk is going to take them to mars next year or that everything elon musk has done has been a scam parlayed by his father's emerald mind and part of the motivation here is obviously to farm attention for themselves because elon musk is a big personality with followers and if they can just get daddy's retweet maybe they too can become big and famous and this is sort of the strategy of a lot of shameless people and cryptocurrencies out there which have tried to tie their financial success to elon musk it's a whole category of new grifter for example floki inu was named after elon musk's dog they named a crypto coin after elon musk tweeted about his future scandal elon gate and immediately it became a thing in fact it's kind of a known fact at this point that if elon musk farts it will quickly gain a billion dollar market cap before everyone figures out it's just hot air and yes i too thought we were past all of this as a species but apparently i was wrong because there's another elon musk token to add to the ranks of worthless coins inter elon goat token if you're one of those people that miss out on sheba or doge it's time to take a really good look at elon go token because we're building him a massive monument and we're delivering it to him at tesla in austin texas that's it that's the whole plan elon goat is going to build a non-functional rocket ship put a goat on it with elon musk's head attached to it and they're going to drive it to the tesla factory and demand that elon musk accept their offering that's their wording this is the thing in 2022 that's supposed to make you financially independent and they even have a 3d rendering of it which just shows you how dumb and terrible it all really is this is supposed to be what catapults you to financial success this is what big business in 2022 looks like a marketing stunt i guess and before we get to the fox business segment which is absolutely insane let's just think for two seconds about this plan this rocket ship they're building doesn't work obviously right um and they want to give it to a guy who builds real rocket ships they think that's going to get his attention it's going to wow him that they've built him a much smaller much worse non-functional rocket ship i mean even the size of it it's a joke that recently elon musk posted like about the real rockets that he builds um and i'm i'm including it here and i did you the service of adding in their rocket ship for scale to help you understand what we're dealing with here they're gonna drive this up to the factory and drop it at the doorstep i don't even know if anyone's gonna notice in fact if you stack six of their fake rockets you still end up going nowhere this is the new strategy of cryptocurrency in 2022 guys these people realized it's not actually about doing anything it's just about getting elon musk to retweet you so that idiots will put their money in and lose it all as you sell off and get rich so now that you're kind of up to speed about this whole scheme let's talk about fox business which is a mainstream investing channel who for some unknown reason brought on elon goat token to the show called making money with charles payne now i do want to be clear the elon goat team says that this was not a paid ad and on charles's show this is not labeled an ad or paid programming so they claim it's earned media and i also have to tell you that charles payne has gotten in trouble in the past for not disclosing that he's been paid to push worthless stocks he even got fined by the sec but i'm sure this time is different let's watch together and tell me what you think all right hey let me walk walk us through how this project came about guys it started with a really crazy viral idea uh there are a lot of tokens out there that are seeking elon musk's attention every day he's given it to many and we just thought the best way to do it would be to do something that no one else has ever done before and build something really really cool that would go viral and get everyone involved and build a lot of energy and hopefully spark his interest and noticing us in a sea of so many others this is so pathetic this whole company or cryptocurrency the whole goal of it is to get a guy to notice them these people are down so bad to daddy musk and by the way get a load of these guys in lab coats behind them that i guess we're told to stand behind them for the shot i mean what are they doing like quick carry a clipboard that'll make them want to invest that'll make them think we're serious businessmen and then next comes maybe the funniest part of all of this this guy charles payne asks the obvious has elon musk noticed you guys do you know the elon musk has actually seen it yet we don't know for sure we've trended very high on his twitter we've ranked top on his twitter feed which i know he's very active on so many times uh we've had you know over probably over a million views now uh on his twitter so there's a good chance that he's seen it we know that there's a lot of tesla employees that are holders of the token and spacex hold spacex holders i'm sorry that are interested in the project and uh more than anything what's most important is that when we deliver it in austin texas in around a month from now that he comes out and takes a look at it or recognizes it in some way that's what's uh that's what's most important i mean it's at this point you almost feel bad for them until you realize that this is all a big money-making scheme of theirs like this isn't a sad attempt to get a guy's attention for no reason this is a sad attempt to get a guy's attention to get rich right this is what people think finance is all about now this is how you get rich these days you invest in non-functional rockets so that you're rich as you get all your other friends to invest because they see elon musk tweet about it i guess because make no mistake that is what this is all about as you'll hear now here's the thing and corey maybe you could chime in on this the crypto critics and even fans i gotta tell you are saying there's too many coins just 19 000 of them so what justifies yours what we're doing it for in the utility there's a lot of coins made every day they're called pumps and dumps in this market a lot of them don't last they're you know they stick around for a day to three days maybe even a week and it people just go into it swing trade hope to make it you know a quick buck however like our coin where the utility that we're introducing to it who we're doing it for how big this is i mean we've we've started a crazy community you know and we refer to it as like you know the bitcoin community we have got most of our holders since day one still holding our token and bringing them you know their grandmas their family their friends you know people often in their life savings pretty much and this is where things get really dark this co-founder apparently knows his community is getting their family members to invest their life savings but doesn't see a problem with it because of the utility what gives you the confidence that someone should for instance bring their grandmother in it with their life savings is that we we have a huge community behind us so you know think about the utility we're the only token out there that has a board of advisory you know like you know that came into crypto have never been part of the project that actually see the beneficial side of this now you gotta love here how they subtly put up the price charts that show that um in four months from january 7th to april 25th the price has fallen by 50 which means investors who put their life savings in the grannies their value dropped by 50 percent but does charles payne making money with charles payne point that out no he says he likes the art well i got to tell you you know i'm just i'm a crypto novice but i i'm a lover of art and i think uh the sculpture is beautiful i hope musk sees it and appreciates it and good luck to you guys ash and corey appreciate it wow this is without a doubt one of the best examples of why crypto is getting ridiculed by so many people as just being full of scams and pump and dumps it's because of projects like this with no actual business plan just a marketing idea just the idea just to shill it as much as you can those are the people getting featured on mainstream investing outlets like this this is an embarrassment you look silly and you should be ashamed of yourself
