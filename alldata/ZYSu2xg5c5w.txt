get back to the video game number one guess the ELO versus chess.com E4 E5 okay little Spanish little Spanish action never hurt anybody how you doing black plays Knight F6 the Berlin oh my God what is this Hikaru versus Wesley so D3 Auntie Berlin ah okay while D5 just uh hangs upon it Knight E5 you've now enabled a pin I have a feeling white took this though yep okay Knight takes castle that that's free but Castle oh wow he saw she saw Bishop B4 oh block that all day all day now the best move for black is castles but there's ain't no way oh boom nice yup now million dollar question which of these two pieces is better to capture very good twitch chat very good the Knight 3-0 is better than five three all right 3-0 is better than five three unless you lose in the second leg of the Champions uh in the Champions League so yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Bishop D5 wow beautiful stuff here by white cleaning things up all right Castle don't even think about it castle that's also a really good move by the way really good move because black either has to trade or King fa I like Queen E2 is a top computer move oh and this is terrible boom now trade the Queens oh my God Castle it's a perfect game so far Pawn to D4 great move too don't hang your Bishop that's I wouldn't guard like that but oh by the way by the way here much much simpler is just to trade the Bishops but fine all right yes is there gonna be a plot twist ah there's the plot twist uh ah all right there there it is there's the plot twist yeah I know G3 was one of the top engine moves but I you're not stockfish all right I'm trying to get you to build good habits otherwise this happens you see if the bishop had been moved out of the way it would have never lost the bishop now Knight B6 is still winning for white because white has three extra pawns so what white should do is centralize the Rooks do not take on F4 good nice okay I trade the Rooks trade the Rooks trade the Rooks okay oh Rook at 587 GG Rook F5 A7 of yep tunnel vision tunnel vision Rook F5 oh no don't tell me no you're gonna yeah oh Rook takes F1 in in between move all right you're still winning though nice nice nice clean push the yo you are not pushing the right Pawns okay one Pawn remaining how's your Technique Knight opposition night opposition oh wow no not opposition hey look at that oh my God clean that was clean the king and queen technique damn I'm thinking like hmm Spanish opening okay one inaccuracy then you played super clean I gotta tell you I mean there was some tunnel vision for sure the technique here like you can just keep it simple like hanging the bishop in one move was weird uh Rook f5a8 is like super simple like but even this worked man I mean this this was good too I'm getting like 1300 Vibes maybe I think though you know a little bit goofy in a couple of spots but hanging the bishop was definitely weird so maybe 1100 but black played so bad don't you think that don't you think black loses a little bit of credibility in this game somehow I feel like I feel like black played so bad I don't know I'm not all right I'm gonna say white is like high 1100 and black is definitely lower rated than white for sure if it like I'm gonna say yeah I'm gonna say like 1100. now let's see what they actually are and then let's also see what chess.com thinks they are all right let's uh let's get the whole package here uh I'm gonna try to get us uh get us over there give me a moment there it is boom what no no no way oh my God why does 796 and black is 720 no no shot brother why does 700 here I'll make this bigger I'll make the I'm gonna crop this a little bit just just so you can see better what dude that's crazy that is unbelievable you can see on the right side there yeah chess.com's got this weird glitch it like shows your your highest and what did what did chess.com think their ratings were oh that's what I I said 1100 and I said white definitely played way better than black remember it's not the rating you see here but rather this 796 and 722 this is some new new chess com glitch you know chess.com is keeping us on our toes with all these glitches wow yeah so I was kind of right white played way way better yeah new accounts yes new accounts made in 2017. yes oh look at look at twitch chat being detect oh Sherlock Holmes strikes again the new account that's six years old old says this this is why I do the streaming and you do the twitch common thing all right yeah it's a feature exactly exactly new account yeah it's a new account Gotham all right next game that was uh wow so I was kind of right I'll give myself props there all right next uh next game oh we gotta we gotta hide us we gotta Hide You the song YouTube Can't know we got music here all right that was a that was a good game I feel like that was a good one though am I five foot two I'm shorter brother I'm four nine but when I wear my six inch heels yeah that's what I'm that's when I'm big all right D4 ah wouldn't be against the ELO without an England Gambit now we just need a London and we're good d e okay Queen E7 we what is this put that's not the move what is this this is not the move guys that's not what you're supposed to play here he foregar bro for God okay what what the what oh my God y'all 500 bro yeah 500 man oh my oh my God oh my God what what is he doing bro that's crazy what is going on Bishop D6 what are these what are you what are y'all doing man first of all right I don't know what kind of a crack cocaine move E6 is just develop your pieces brother what what is this should be for block with the pawn it's check all right now finish your development dude take the bishop and and I don't know H3 why are you hanging up okay and here's something really ridiculous happens white goes here attacking the bishop black doesn't take the bishop so white forces black to take the bishop oh my God oh my God are you kidding me okay the Knight goes back bro he hung the night come on yo oh my god oh castle please he's gonna go Rook d8 oh my God man I literally got like 20 YouTube videos on this guys I got so many videos on this y'all Play Moves attacking a queen and you go I'm attacking the queen it must be a good move there's a person on the other side they're gonna take your Pawn with check you now he's just up like 90 point bro his King is running bro oh my God oh my God man it's a miracle white even saw this move by the way Castle bro just Castle bro thank you I don't even care you hung the pawn you think black is gonna see this come on man bro this guy this guy walked his King out of a war zone out of a war zone just to open up the position again bro he trading Queens down three pawns but he not even trading bro that crazy so something crazy is gonna happen what what is this you got a queen a rook and seven pawns and you just play this you think you think oh H4 bro just push oh my God he's trading the Queens [Music] he hung The Rook oh my God and you know white was nasty nasta backwards diagonal moves how many times in this game did white make a super long diagonal move I think white is 400 but 3 000 at Queen moves like look at this there are not many 400s that would see that the queen can go this far they would do this that's crazy white is like a like a savant at these Queen moves oh my God he's just flexing now wait wait whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa oh Justin's oh oh let's check oh thank God oh he got him cut the king off nice clean oh my oh my oh my oh my okay so why does like 500 okay Max however at making Queen moves white is like Hikaru level like if white just only was able to use I I think white should start only playing Scholars mate type of stuff I think white is nasty with the queen uh all right so it was an England Gambit where black was losing after three moves so clearly I mean it's got to be three digit uh there was some semblance of kind of I mean Bishop H3 is an insanity what is Bishop H3 this phase of the game was played like it was two babies like if babies just could select from a random move generator this would have been the quality of the game for the first 15 moves ain't no way it's 900 if it's 900 I'ma end the episode if I'm I'm gonna end the episode if it's 900 then it kind of normalized all right some of these moves were pretty good by white and then white actually played well No actually that's complete guess I am guessing it's so hard white played so many logical moves black just hung a rook I'm gonna say I'm gonna say 600 gotta be 600 I'll tell you like white was white is definitely high rated than black for sure uh but uh is 600. all right here we go no no it's got to be lost I think white is 600. and uh and I think uh yeah I think black is probably lower let's see uh this is not the game this is the previous game 400. wait right 420 and 467. bro you yo this is a mad dangerous username therapist dog uh because that uh that could be read uh oh my God y'all you might want to change that uh What uh what did I thought you were 600 oh oh oh yo me and chescon were oh yo I'm so nasty I said you were 600 and chess.com also thought you were 600 bro nice damn I told you you're 600 but with the queen bro he's a dog with the queen oh my yeah yeah that's a dangerous username there there's a guy on Tick Tock who who recently posted that he also had to change his username because because his username was therapist but it's a good username a therapist this dog is a great thing uh but yeah I mean the the yeah the English language is kind of weird okay wow uh that that was crazy I so far so good meet me and Shazam we kind of you know we kind of aligned all right wow that was wild I called 600 right I thought shells.com would think you were 600 okay black is uh black is uh subscriber in the next game E4 E5 wow King's Gambit so either super good or super terrible all right um here we go Shadow I just realized chat on the screen is a little bit laggy in this episode I don't know what's going on it's just seems like it's uh twitch twitch is always twitch is always glitchy it's okay yeah maybe too many Chatters it's all good all right ef4 Bishop C4 this is uh this is a crazy line Queen H4 King F1 is is a line here there's also King E2 no cap all right Bishop C5 is a really bad move though you should not put Bishops in the center if they can get slapped by pawns because you are just making your life much harder for yourself yeah you see now now white gets oh white is winning already yeah you gotta you gotta be very careful with the weak F7 Square yeah wow white finds it oh my all right so what are we thinking like 16 1700 is that what we're thinking because that that's kind of what I'm thinking I'm I'm thinking that's what I'm thinking already what a what a tactic of course in case anybody's confused Knight E5 is crushing which would have worked even if it wasn't a discovered attack Knight C3 this is so this is so unnecessarily disrespectful it still can't be taken by the way oh my God ah Queen trap bro what are what what what he found a backwards night move to trap the that's crazy good move you got to get something back don't take the Rook do not take the Rook take the bishop I wouldn't take the Rook cause now the thing is you're down a lot of pieces now you don't you don't have a lot of yo you really going forward are you are you nuts bro where's the king going I mean listen I don't mean no disrespect to The King and I don't mean to body shame King's not a very athletic dude all right this is like if uh this is like if a middle-aged uh you know overweight CEO went to the playground to fight for like uh his son okay I mean like you know he he should be in a corporate office all right his son got beat up at the playground he shouldn't go fight for it he can't move too well I'm just saying like he might he might need to hit the gym first the king can only move one square at a time all right he's kind of oh boy oh he hung his Queen see the king oh God I can't believe it bro the youngest Queen man this is why you guys need to look for checks captures attacks the next level of chess strategy is an intermediate is before you make a move you gotta go does my opponent have a check capture an attack oh God Bishop H4 is such a brutal oh my D yup yo yo keep going might as well right bro he's gonna take on D4 so this at this level of Chess I think black is just more concerned for the memes and not actually winning the game oh my God he's going all the way back Bro I think at some point black decided I'm just gonna end up on guess the ELO bro what does he do what the f what is wrong with him okay hangs a rook Rook d8 B6 take C5 Knight E5 okay Bishop E6 ah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa your Bishop bro okay yes everybody knows that when you're down a full night in an end game you should trade your most powerful attacking p good question guys I got a question is did you got y'all kicked in the head by a horse when you were like like five years old or something you are winning by a full night and your opponent offers to trade literally the only threat in the position how do you not just snap take and promote like and win the pawn and promote like what I hope you lose this game how about that I hope you lose he's gonna hang his way he's gonna hang something though he's gonna hang a rook he's gonna get mated yup yeah oh oh oh we hung The Rook nice and it's made only one next all right you won Levi what do you think about Hikaru versus Wesley so I think you should spell my name right because it's four letters that's what I think all right um the the opening stage of this game first of all Bishop C5 being played and getting hit by D4 definitely screams early intermediate um because I think like a 14 1500 does not blunder this in the early State Bishop F7 is crazy 92 is wicked too ha you know I'm gonna say something crazy I'm gonna say like 13 1400. is that is that insane because guys didn't I mean white look at the stuff that white was doing do you really think anywhere below that white plays Knight E2 no 1300 plays Bishop C5 yeah but I feel like White's got to be a higher rated estimate right uh all right I'm gonna say like yeah I'm gonna say like high 1200 low 1300. that's what I think yeah that's my guess ain't no way bro 18. 1724 versus yo get the notch Hill chill chill bro what the no no are you joking no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no chance bro 1800 are you joking with me bro this dude on the queen 1800 on the queen oh God oh my God what are you crazy and what did chess.com think you were because I said you're 12 1300. just come you out of your damn mind this is the dumbest feature of all time man y'all really thought they were 1800 y'all really for a second thought that in 1800 goes here in 10 seconds and blunders it yo we have dropped our standards we have dropped our standards chess.com no way no way chess.com let this be a lesson 99 of people watching this right now are below that rating 99 there's like 70 people watching who are like hmm I'm 1900 and I don't make blunders like that because everybody knows that once you go above 1900 you just get you just get a British accent that's just how it works because you're sophisticated that's crazy that is crazy 1800 no the feature is only trash when it doesn't uh the feature is only trash when it uh it doesn't agree with me uh otherwise uh otherwise it's it's the best feature oh my God 1800 is unbelievable who who I none of you thought they were 1800 come on let's let's cut that out right now not a single person on the planet looked at that game and said 1800 not one not a single person 1800 plays like these guys oh my God give me the time controls first give me the time controls first what do you mean give me the time controls first you asking for the time controls we talking about time controls we talking not a game we talking about time controls the time controls are literally on the screen bro they are right here bro do you not see the minutes and the numbers bro Siff Joseph the third they're on the screen what do you mean give me this this is a 10 minute game played between two 1800s what nah absolutely not there's just no way no this was their younger siblings playing no no no no no the 1800 level players gave the iPads to the younger siblings who are 1200 there's just no way there's just no way there's just no way there's no way there's no way there's no way ain't no way ain't no way we know when you're talking about practice all right E4 E5 what are we gonna get another King's Gambit thank God tell us time controls before showing the ELO how are you to record your own guess the ELO Series where you tell the time control beforehand and we will watch that one all right here we go two nights with D3 all right Bishop C5 H6 okay preventing Knight G5 yeah I I don't know about that all right friends okay everybody stop uh stop worrying about uh stop worrying about uh my high-pitched voice okay I can already see the YouTube comments please never do that voice again that high-pitched voice actually triggered bad memories I had when my cat used to wake me up with a screech at three in the morning please be sensitive to individuals who have sensitive ears are you sensitive twice in one sentence or I will go to Twitter and I will complain about you um all right um when you play E4 E5 openings you you have to be very careful when you open up the center because you're playing with black and you are multiple moves behind your opponent in development here so you need to play Bishop C5 before you open the center with D5 okay all right yeah cause now rookie won yeah yeah and see the problem with with this move is it actually doesn't stop Knight E5 isn't that crazy all right it you stop nothing okay of course white didn't see it though okay nah yeah bro you were so close you were so close Castle vibe why Queen F6 uh yeah now that dude now you yeah you just gave the bishop oh my God he's not even G4 here is winning G4 you can unpin yourself in Knight E5 what what is the oh Queen E3 is trying to play an id5 okay that's crazy oh my God I love this queen H5 just crushing King is gonna move yup oh my oh my look over at the chat go from how do I connect my Twitch account to my Discord go for Miss in the middle of recording an episode of his most successful series average

I'll keep going uh all right why is white winning because Black's King is on D7 so King is open what should all good move d4 nice don't trade Queens do not trade the Queens takes C4 boom amazing boom Rook A7 Rook A7 Rook A7 oh it's over yeah Rook A8 what what is rookie five what was the idea here was the idea he takes my queen I take his Queen guys what what gotta be low time right like just gotta be low time I mean there's just no bro why what why did you sack the queen who are you trying to impress okay oh my God oh my God oh oh oh oh he trapped The Rook but C5 C5 right what the hell is going on okay The Rook is out there we go King E4 uh oh oh my god oh this is so scary what is happening it's a draw no it's losing oh he's gonna win the H4 Pawn Yeah now it's a win what was that game what was that game what was that game that was such an odd game it was like it wasn't a good game by black white played pretty well pretty controlled and then the infiltration I like the avoidance of the queen trade I mean white played white played like a 2000 for the first 30 moves what happened here what happened here I don't understand what was this I don't what happened I he just played like a perfect game and then he cut anurism or something um but then he made 30 more moves so I don't think time was that low I'm gonna say like 1500 I don't I don't know I mean like I want to say 800 but how how did how did white play so well in the beginning is it 1500 or 700 what what like white played so well did white play so well actually let me think no you know what I'm amending it I'm saying 900. I'm saying 900. Final Answer 900 is my final answer that's crazy because I I actually looked at the way white played white played a lot of one move type of plans I'm going 900 final answer it was originally 1500 now it's 900. it's 1700 yo oh God oh my God bro oh my God there is just no way these people nah this is so stupid what how are they what how are they sick how are they 17 already oh my God it's like an uh this is some no no bro I can't I can't I what okay no I I no but guys I mean guys yeah look if you're 1700 it is crazy to play H6 and D5 it's just crazy like how are you losing in five moves in one of the most classical openings in chess whoever is my Gotham sub whoever is my Gotham sub I don't know whose game this was brother how are you losing in five moves in E4 E5 I mean it's legitimately not possible I brother how are you doing this to yourself and also how did you get the 1700 doing this to yourself you are nerfing yourself can you imagine what your level would be if you played real openings 1700 with this nonsense you would be G you'd be Magnus Carlson with normal openings oh my goodness I mean then you played well but you were just losing the whole game and then I but then your opponent I mean for you played well you played fine what the f I mean what the hell is this man this is just I don't even know guys I this was a crazy great I crazy game I don't know what's I'm speechless no I'm listen you don't have to do anything you're 1700 you're like 99th percentile chess player of course you have to do nothing if you can get games like this and be 90s 1700 don't forget I forget about it it's unbelievable okay oh my God I love it all right um okay we got a London Knight C6 H6 G5 uh triple digits okay okay attacks the bishop once twice and three times but doesn't take it nice oh now he takes oh pushing pawns oh the tunnel vision is strong in this game oh there we go Knight G2 oh wow the first move of the whole game that black does not have an obvious pawn move black hangs upon Knight E4 just winning upon 94 it just wins upon okay doesn't take oh thanks Queen thanks Queen nice great move best move of the game very important move because it's a very close position that hangs a knight in one move oh nice we're gonna end on a nice game yup oh gorgeous beautiful game wow absolutely no way you're above 700 though okay you played a pretty normal game I mean Bishop B5 is absolutely not what you do in the London but fine uh you know you did you did fine you played normal that's the good thing about the London is it gets you playing normally yeah you don't need to do this okay this is what I love is that you know that in the London you're supposed to play C3 so you're just like I'm gonna play C3 now but it doesn't make any sense to play C3 now because you don't have a bishop but it's fine um but you played well I mean I like okay G3 also makes no sense but you're trying to bring the Knight back so it kind of makes sense uh you and then you won the queen no look I think white is gonna get an estimate this game of being like 1300. so personally I think this game was played between two six seven hundred rated players but I think white is going to get an estimate of like 1400 Maybe because I think white just played very well and I think black is gonna get an estimate like 400 points lower okay that's what I think that's that that's I think they're both about 700 but that's what we're gonna end on let's see big window 589 versus 620. wow and what does it 1100 okay I overestimated but uh White really outplayed black in that one the opening was balanced that was a well-fought middle game that white got the better of yes it was definitely a well-fought middle game where black hunger Queen in one move but I guess that was move 20 so yeah yeah wow impressive crazy episode today bogus episode all right the two middle games of 1800 rated players was the dumbest thing I ever I mean folks how are y'all 1800 kilos man y'all paid someone to boost you you know back in the day in Maplestory uh I would pay people and I would hang out on a tree branch and they would do Genesis on the map and kill all the animal all the things and I would exp leech off of them all right that's how I leveled up in Maplestory is that what y'all did
