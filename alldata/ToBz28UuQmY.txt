ladies and gentlemen welcome back to how to win a chess this is a series where I play against my twitch subscribers and I go up the rating ladder walking you through all the stages of the game as the game is going on this is episode 29 and in this episode we are beginning at the lowest ELO of around 11 1200 we will once again be ending at about 2200 rapid uh also if you watch this video today and today only which is March 17th 2024 it's St Patrick's Day uh and all my courses are 20% off but that ends today so if you clicked on this video you enjoy anything that you see any of these openings again I don't sponsor these episodes so they're sponsored by me you like my content you want to take your chess Journey to the next level uh you can check out some of my courses for free by the way but if you like the full version then uh you want the full version you can you can buy them anyway uh we're kicking things off with uh with my first opponent named I eat rocks who is actually not in the uh they're not there they're not online so that's good and uh I will just sit here and like I said if the players don't show up they really run the risk of getting made fun of on the internet and and that's dangerous stuff uh okay there we go okay actually uh and I I will start with D4 I said 1 1200 but actually my opponent is closer to 1100 so I will adjust this to 1100 I you know otherwise that would be false marketing so I start with D4 every single series I play five games and so I Alternate which colors I play so for this game um normally I play a London but let me just show you how to play a Catalan you can play D4 C4 and then you can play Knight F3 and G3 my opponent plays right away C5 uh striking at my Center this is actually a very confrontational system and it kind of takes away what I want to do which is Knight F3 uh and G3 so I'm going to see what my opponent is trying to do uh my opponent plays B5 wow this is the bko Gambit this is a very very decent opening and the idea of this opening is to give away this pawn and that pawn uh and uh just create a very powerful attack so I'm going to take one of the pawns and so white is going to be up upon Pawn in the end of the B Gambit black is going to have the queen Side open now there is a very sharp aggressive system against this and I think it's called the Nescafe nescaf frap attack and uh I believe it goes something like Knight C3 takes E4 and after B4 Knight B5 Knight takes is a big mistake so I'm going to see if my opponent uh is going to fall for it the best move is probably to take the Gambit but the Beno Gambit is is a very very dangerous opening so full credit to my opponent uh for playing it and they absolutely deserve uh to get you know everything they want I'm playing a very tricky line uh and the Beno is kind of one of those openings that if you're going to be a very serious D4 C4 player you do have to know what you're doing against it you don't see that Beno Gambit a lot at the highest level because I think it's a big risk that black takes by the way very good move by my opponent not actually taking this back uh and and potentially falling into everything that I want to accomplish I'm going to go E4 because that is generally what you want right you want to put two Pawns in the center of the board like this uh and if my opponent is not careful I'm going to go E5 so black really should be playing the move D6 and black does in fact play the move D6 now there are a million and a half ways to play uh the bko Gambit with the white pieces and I'm trying to find one that's appropriate I can always say you know I I I think the general rule of thumb is that if you're going to play in a Gambit kind of situation I almost want to not allow the opponent to have fun you know what I mean like my Pawn's defended so let me just play natural developing moves I'm I'm not going to play too you know too aggressively sometimes I also say like just give the pawn back just play B6 let them take this way they don't open up the Rook but it's sort of a a a choice right it It ultimately will come down to uh to what you want to accomplish uh in the position so my opponent plays Bishop to G7 now of course I I can just just take on A6 which has been there for a while you may be wondering why I'm not taking um the opponent is uh it kind of wants me to do that to to apply pressure to my Queen side I will just take and now this is called the bko Gambit fully accepted I could have taken that on move five I could have taken it move four technically this was move four um now playing this black doesn't actually have to take right away uh they do and now there's also a lot of ways that I can play this i i i this is definitely not the best way to play this but I'm just going to take the bishop to show you you know I'm giving black everything they want like I'm playing directly into a banko Gambit my opponent is probably going to take and then I'm going to Castle and we're going to see just how good and just how well prepared you know my opponent is in this position and by the way as as I go up the ladder as well I I do just want to point out I I did play a bit slowly last week and and I want to avoid a situation of time trouble again now the thing is if you get into a bank of Gambit position with white and you don't know what you're doing it's actually really difficult to figure out the plans which is uh you know black wants to like encroach and do some damage over here so um I uh I'm I'm going to play what I think looks like a a relatively principled move I guess I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to think like a uh like a like a 1100 but also kind of don't want to think like an 1100 necessarily there's a lot of plans here for black to to come down and one of the reasons I I don't really like playing against the bko is because uh black gets a lot of counterplay I do not allow I don't enjoy letting opponents uh play into the Bango Gambit so I'm going to play A3 I think A3 is a generally flexible move it's kind of stops Knight B4 uh and my opponent could play Knight B4 anyway because I can't capture because of the pin but then I would just play Rook B1 now black needs to kind of do some stuff over here maybe Knight D7 to activate the bishop maybe the queen is going to come out um it's a pretty big responsibility for an 1100 to be playing down upon Pawn but we're going to see how my opponent does uh and uh you know maybe they have some experience they do in fact play Queen A5 and I kind of want to rotate my knight this way and kind of just plop it down on this is a very common idea in the bko to play Knight D2 Knight C4 you can also strike in the center you can play E5 trade and then put the Knight on C4 like that um I don't I I mean I don't technically think this is the best move but I feel like it's a move in 1100 would play so it's a natural move you're trying to trade uh my opponent actually probably shouldn't capture I think the best move for black might be something like Knight G4 Knight D7 um M putting pressure on my pawn and kind of making me make the move which would then open up the bishop so I will be extremely impressed if black plays Knight D7 or Knight G4 I might even be too impressed might even be like that's uh that might be a little too I mean I really do feel like the 1100 move is to take but we will see what my opponent comes up with um because keeping the tension making one of these night jumps and just saying well now I you know now I'm making you take me you're taking on my terms that's a sophisticated concept it really is uh and then it's going to be up to me to decide what to do okay they do in fact play Knight to G4 targeting my Pawn now I have to make a decision if I play H3 obviously I just lose my Pawn taking opens up their Bishop but that might be fine so I am in fact going to take I think E6 was just kind of a silly move I don't really know what my opponent is thinking about now um yeah that is sort of the way to go now my Knight's hanging I should probably protect it uh but I can also continue with my plan of Knight D2 and Knight C4 I can just very simply play this move if I play this move however this Pawn kind of loses a little bit of protection but okay let's play Bishop d again I I I I'm trying to play moves appropriate for the level and I think there is nothing wrong with this also very important to pay attention to things that are hanging in the position that Knight is hanging so when this Knight moves somewhere that Knight's not going to have any protection of course the Knight could just rotate to E5 like for the bko this is this is kind of a dream I really got to tell you this is a uh a very this is like a dreamy position for a bko player we're just going to see if my opponent is able to uh Carry On from here I do have various tricks sometimes when there's a queen at the end of uh of an opening of a position like this you sometimes have these little tactical tricks after Pawn takes Pawn takes the queen is attacked twice it's going to be attacked by the rook and the pawn so you always kind of want to look out for these these little shots like that that you could you could you could get actually look what I just calculated okay that's that's a that's a win for me I feel like um getting you know getting the queen so far out of the position kind of want to play Bishop F4 and put some pressure I also kind of want to just attack the Knight but I do know the Knight is going there so it's not really it's not really much progress that I'm making uh you know you know it's a move I I like that doesn't really require much thought and again it's it's a lazy move but like I just didn't have to think much and I improved my position you kind of don't want to over complicate things um and I and I think just taking a full file compared to where my Rook was is probably a decent move now for black black can now consider C4 and and getting the knight in Rook B8 is also completely reasonable or is it wait a minute I see two loose pieces wait a minute that looks like a fork to me but there is Queen C8 does my opponent have the board Vision to spot Queen C8 we're going to see all right the pawn is hanging by the way when The Rook went to B8 right Rook B8 did attack the pawn on B2 but uh now Queen C8 does hit both this might be the moment my opponent thinks they've blunder they also might just forget about the Knight on G4 at 1100 it's possible it's not you know it's not like uh but they have been pretty sharp so far uh when Queen C8 happens the yeah that's what I thought would happen I just literally predicted that that's yeah that and and that's part of this level is you could play 15 really really good moves and all of a sudden you're like what have I done uh and um you know they're going to probably take on B2 but that's not enough just getting that back is not then I have to be a little careful because when they take on B2 I have to think what my knight loses protection which is bad okay well that I mean I I should probably just trade I probably shouldn't even think twice about it but I don't have to but okay I mean if you're going to trade Rooks with me the second that I won a night I'm going to trade Rooks with you this now has no defense the most natural and easy move is Rook B1 and and and then maybe we can just kind of pause there and figure it out th this for now seems good one thing to keep in mind is that if the bishop takes the Knight I can't take with the pawn so if this bishop was not here Rook B1 would be a bad move so you can't just think about this you also have to think about the pin right but I am winning one more thing small detail play H3 at some point just make sure you're never getting back rank mated it's just good protocol now could I have played Rook E1 and probably traded both Rooks yeah but sometimes just a quick move like Rook B1 in 11 seconds it it's the right thing to because let the opponent think let the opponent think chess is also practical you play with a clock right like rugby1 is just a practical move here because we don't want to lose anything we we we don't want to over complicate things right now okay so it was a good you know it was a good battle but now I'm up a knight I'm going to make sure I can't get M it I'm going to well now now I probably will trade The Rook because this is the the second time the queen retreated and if I can get the Rooks off the board I'm going to be fine I'm going to be in great shape like now we just go straight for the end game and we don't even think about it and that night is now loose so I've got various ways of attacking it the queen was kind of the MVP of our position and you see in this game my opponent gave away the pawn played the bko but like three four moves out of the opening their pieces were sort of spread far apart and it was a little bit difficult to figure out exactly what to do by the way my Queen's under attack I could take the Rook CU it's check um I think it's a it's pretty natural here to play something like Queen C4 though just attacking this and you know F5 is a completely reasonable move another small detail when the pawn moves you got to start thinking what got weak that square E6 got weak so right away I'm thinking can I can I plop a knight into the E6 Square can I maybe play Bishop G5 we don't have to trade Rooks you can right you can just play Rook takes just get it off the board now make sure the queen can't come down it can't you could play H4 or you know or H3 me personally I would just say Pro you know just just make sure you can't get mated just make sure just a good rule of thumb not necessary at all could you know we obviously could go for the weaknesses it's just good practice especially if you're 1100 like it'll save you blunders in the future you'll you know not make any completely ridiculous mistakes um and also we should keep an advantage on the clock so we have a 1 and a half minute time Edge and the way we win this we can continue to trade in a perfect world we trade the queens in a perfect perfect world we trade all the pieces and we just are left with a knight uh but we would push this Pawn this is our outside Pawn that is the pawn that our opponent gave to us in the opening and we try to trade some pieces down now I was saying the banko for this level is like it's a good opening in theory but it is a very difficult opening to handle and you'll notice by the way how calm I'm keeping everything I'm not touching any of the pieces I'm just going to push the pawn as far as I can force my opponent to go play defense and then I'm going to you know my next move might be Knight to B5 for example just get rid of the Knight Bishop C3 get rid of the bishop right of course you can play Bishop here you could play a lot of different things here I can even play B4 by the way B4 was also very reasonable trying to you know just trade and um the the most important thing is that black is spending more time now I'm up over 2 minutes right so that's the difficult thing about about the Bango is that it's it's a little it's a little bit of a mysterious opening okay let let me let me follow the protocol of trading nights it's probably not the best move by the way um because it opened up the bishop it's probably not the best move but again I'm just trying to be practical and um this is a good concept by black trying to attack me with pawns but my queen does protect everything I would not move a pawn like this just opening up the king but you'll probably be fine if you do um a queen trade is good I don't think our opponent will trade I think they'll probably put the queen in the center um but uh it could be worth investigating you know whether or not they're going to activate the queen like the best move is definitely to avoid and also to continue to cause problems if they play Queen E4 I will be very impressed uh um and then maybe I can even just go in and eat the pawn maybe right again it it's just about making sure you're not going to suffer here like it that's well done well done I like that my queen can come back to protect my king I what I tell I don't like is this stuff that looks a little bit scary to me so I will give this check and I'm going to try to win as many pawns as I can by the way we have a little you know we could have a little tactic here with Bishop takes that's a nice little T tactic and then you have this Fork technically technically it doesn't quite work because there is Queen B1 check so there's an in between move that would stop that let's see if my opponent sees it oh they didn't they did not see that uh and it again that's part of the game Queen B1 check in between move unfortunately now they that's a fork this I can pre-move because there's no way to defend the pawn and uh if you're going to pre-move this game out you just want to put your queen on a light Square because this is on a on a dark Square so um we have a lot of moves this is discover check and we will there is Bishop F6 I would now give a check and you can even sack the queen you can you can also just Queen but you can sack the queen make a queen and now just make another queen if they go here take Ju Just make sure you're not stalemating anybody make sure there's always a legal move once you get the second Queen it's all checks I want all checks until mate so don't play games yeah we're just going to I mean you don't have to but as long as there are legal moves that's a check and now the easiest by far the easiest is to cut the king off make sure it's not stalemate but I want the Queens on alternating ranks right so we're going to we're going to make sure the Queens are not on the same straightaway and now we have yeah now we have an easy ladder boom and now you can pre-move and you pre moove down and you and you get the ladder you got to get the Queens on alternating lines either horizontal or vertical and then you kind of slide down and uh and and and that's how you win so um that was a that was a good game I mean I was surprised to see an 1100 playing the bko and then you know I I I thought I I played relatively kind of straightforward moves um Knight G4 was a nice concept and you know I I played like Bishop D2 which was a little bit passive and the thing about this bko is that um it's like 3.4 sort of forever and then the way that black has to create counterplay is like Knight C7 Rook B8 and it you almost never take a step back because like look at the advantage it's. three the second you go back it's like five 6 I played rookie one which was sort of an easy move all of a sudden it's plus one the only way to defend both Knights is to play Queen C8 now I would play Bishop F4 attacking and and and somehow black never I don't know I don't know it it never it like almost feels like it never gets off the ground and that's one of the dangerous things about this bko just overall is that if if white sort of controls you and doesn't let you have fun and obviously you know my opponent blundered a knight which is obviously going to make things more complicated we traded Rooks and I thought we did a you know a pretty clean job of simplification but um I don't know I I'm not a you know beno's fine obviously I'm not here just criticizing the opening but I'm just sort of showing you like the way that black should have handled that was stack you know stacking the a in the b files and and my opponent I I felt like backed up and they shouldn't have they they shouldn't have backed up in the bko you almost never back up and in any Gambit really you um um you know you you don't back up now I'm going to do it again I've got a Scandinavian defense course it's on Chesley it's 20% off for only today and um and and I'm going to play it and I'm playing my Scandinavian defense and you could get a whole free sample so if you don't want to spend any money you can still check this out um and you know the main line is D4 and Bishop C4 we'll see what my opponent plays this is all very standard stuff okay now generally this Pawn comes here but sometimes people play it a little bit differently sometimes they play D3 a little bit more and okay I have another person playing uh D3 I haven't played this person before right yeah we've never played before but I had a person play this against me quite recently in one of these episodes and you know a lot of people they do this and technically when the pawn is on D4 which is the main way to play the Scandinavian the move Bishop B4 is what I like it's in my Scandinavian course here I don't like it as much okay Bishop E3 is not targeting my queen so I don't have to get a you know I don't have to make a getaway uh but I I I I also just think it's like good practice just just my queen can now Escape sort of anytime and there is some pressure on on that side of the board um normally the bishop is going to E7 but I don't really see a reason not to put it more actively I mean generally the bishop is there so we will now both Castle I will always play Bishop G6 and my opponent played more passively uh the more aggressive way to play the scandi is to put the pawn in the center but you notice like I just have a very good structure I'm going to finish my development I'm going to Castle and we're going to play another aggressive way to play the Scandinavian is to Castle long but that's very dangerous because then white can attack you and you attack white I'm going to play it the right way the proper way I'm just going to Castle short I'm going to show you it's probably the easiest opening to play in chess and the most solid besides maybe the carocon but we will now finish our development and then we will right um we will uh we we we will kind of consider the next step in the game when I see a bishop here and I see a pawn here I'm always thinking to advance with my Pawn try to get that Bishop try to play like Knight here Knight here take that Bishop when it goes there I like bringing the queen back and then eyeing that side of the board I like sneezing again you want to check out scandy right now there's a corses sale um but uh if you also want to test it out going to take the car for a test drive for free you're more than welcome to do that my opponent's trying to go here but that's sort of plays directly into my hands I I I haven't uh finished my development yet now I will defend my knight and and speaking of which Bishop F6 is actually not as scary as you would think because I can slide my king here and go here and that's actually something you learn as you get stronger at chess like it's it's a little deceiving sometimes oh my goodness a good move here by white would be Knight to E4 because the move Bishop D4 opened up the E file and now bringing a knight here would be quite strong a lot of people do play Knight H4 they also play this and the best way that I like to meet this move is actually just to bring the bishop back to G6 and be completely solid now my queen sees more of the fifth rank very important to understand how your pieces interact when other pieces move right so when that Bishop moved the Rook opened when that Knight moved the queen opened right when my Bishop moved my queen opened I like to do this because when they take I get a rock solid formation near my king and I am not going to lose anytime soon so scandi is um yeah very very solid now of course we will take HG these Bishops are pretty strong but they're staring into very very well protected uh pieces maybe I will bring my Rooks to the center maybe I will kick out the bishop with E5 I actually had this in the last how to win a chess if you are a frequent viewer you will remember and if you're not then that's okay and if you are a frequent viewer but you don't remember cuz just as hard in uh the previous episode I played E5 but then my opponent's light scored Bishop got very strong so maybe maybe in this game what I'll do is I'll not play E5 I'll just bring the queen over I'll Pawn storm try to trap these pieces over here and uh I mean I don't have any big Advantage but I have a very easy toplay position and a position that I that I like quite a lot I mean just bring the Rooks to the middle now prepare for the next phase of the game I said that move was going to be reasonable like a moment ago and it continues to be reasonable uh the immediate threat is the attack on my Bishop now my first instinct is to take I'm going to pause though like I'm going to say like do I have to take right my knight is well protected by my knight and my Pawn although maybe I don't want my my Pawn to move I don't want my king to be open so this move comes to mind cuz I you know I kind of don't want to allow The Rook into the game that seems a little bit a little bit silly for me to do so it's not very often that going back is uh is a is a great move I mean I could go forward could go forward get a trade you know trade off that Bishop which is pretty strong that you know now the more that I look at it that doesn't look you know that doesn't look half bad so I might do it and the idea the only thing I got to be care I got to be a little careful is that if my queen lands in the middle a rook is going to see my queen so I got to make sure my queen can always dart out of the way it can it could go somewhere where it can be although the Knight can also take the Knight can also take so sometimes when your opponent is pressuring you a lot you want to make trade trades because that way they can't pressure you with pieces but you'll notice you don't want to just make lazy trades if you make this trade another piece reappears you got rid of a piece they have a new one that emerged so by doing this I will trade and they don't have an emergence of a new piece there's no piece I'm just getting rid of the dark squared Bishop but to be honest with you both moves were probably fine B4 whoa and so if I if I take is the idea rugby one is that the idea now I can't protect my Pawn but there is an interesting line there take Rook B1 and I bring the queen here defending that pawn if my knight moves I think that works but it is a little bit dangerous it's also a little unrealistic I feel like for 1500 so I'm going to go here that is definitely not the best move we will analyze later I don't think this was correct but you know uh but we will see also when I come here I'm creating a battery with my Bishop down to that pawn if any of you were wondering why I didn't take a free Bishop because my queen was hanging but I think Queen B4 was actually fine I think it was fine I think I I think maybe but that was a little bit of a complicated defensive sequence I was tactically defending my Pawn because the bishop was hanging my opponent would have needed to move the bishop blah blah blah also my Discord just went off and I apologize for that that was my Discord should be on streamer mode when I am recording there we go now I am on streamer mode now we sit and wait for a move okay we should not take with the Knight because we lose defense of this we can take with the pawn or we can come back and take with the bishop I'm just going to say I I don't really like the concept of Opening space near my king so I'm going to take with the bishop but I think they're both fine and when the bishop takes I'll take with the Knight and we just have a very solid game we're completely safe we have to pay a little bit of attention cuz you never know when you're opponent can sacrifice but we go okay now we have an end game there's no immediate threat so probably bringing a rook to the center is correct we could consider an attack still but after Bishop B3 I I mean I don't really see why what we're accomplishing uh Knight to D5 is also an interesting move uh it uh puts pressure on the pawn and it offers up an exchange tough to say like what you know I I think you don't spend a lot of time here you just can play like Rook d8 for example the sacrifice doesn't work so this is you can't sacrifice here there's not enough pieces to attack with what you should be careful about is if the queen goes there and The Rook goes behind the queen and then your opponent checkmates you that would be bad but accomplishing that is actually not possible 1 2 3 four five moves that would take and if you can't see that that's coming in five moves I don't really know what to tell you you know if your opponent goes here you can even move the queen in close and now none of that is going to be happening but it it's I mean it's a plan you know like if my opponent sees that and goes for it it's a plan a plan's a plan uh but I'm going to be faster I'm going to be faster I'm not going to let that happen you know not to mention I could play Rook e eight and run my king to the center which ironically could be safe I can also hide checkmate with my you know I can protect checkmate with my knight uh A3 the secret to playing with pawns against pawns because I really do feel like this is a position a lot of people would sort of lose their way in is improve your position to the max like double your Rooks uh you know centralize your knight potentially and trade and open up and then at that point you got to start moving your pawns me personally I would play B5 and A5 that would be my combination of moves but I would be cognizant of the fact that this Pawn gets weak once these pawns go I would not start with A5 because then the pawn can come forward although it's probably all fine the truth is it's chess and it's probably all fine so for now let's let let's continue the philosophy of like improving our position and and doubling and just getting you know active if we get attacked which definitely looks quite reasonable this Pawn gets weak but it's I mean we it's still chess like it's it's not we haven't earned anything yet there's no you know nothing impressive just yet about our position so um and this is why the Scandinavian is not necessarily for everybody you know it's a little bit too slow like you get these very good positions you have zero risk of losing quickly but then have to play and not everybody wants to play but if you're like 1,800 1900 2100 like these are great great openings to have because that you know the game goes on a while and that kind of shows like all right C3 was maybe a little silly so we'll come back we are blocking Our Queen which I'm not a huge fan of but this is life um you know we're going to also double up so we have doubled Rooks not really clear what the threat is yet but maybe we will kick out the bishop and instigate it's that's the key word about all this it's we're instigating that's what we're trying to do like Knight D5 now for example Knight D5 attacks the rook and the pawn so actually white has to trade right and now it's a fascinating choice we can take with the pawn or The Rook I wouldn't take with this Pawn cuz then you don't get any benefit if we take with this Pawn at least we are opening up some pressure over there but I got to tell you this looks really good just doubled Rooks and now maybe we start you know we start coming over here we we start trying to get in with the queen all while paying a little attention to that side of the board that move threatens the pawn but that's going to be an easy fix so now I'm going to strike with A5 and I'm going to try to soften up White's Pawn structure and just bulldo down this line another thing at the end of this line is that the Rook well now the Rook is gone actually so that's not a bad move by the way trying to anticipate the opening of the position um might have been good for me to play E5 there that might have been a well-timed move it still might be a well-timed move E5 and after a big trade we get a we get an active Queen we could play B5 now to restrict both of these moves you know we could try to play Rook F5 a lot of things so since there's so many complications what I would say is you have to keep an edge on the clock somehow like you can't just fall asleep and say oh my God you know I got to I'm going to sit and I'm going to think I'm going to solve the let's go E5 let's try to make something happen let's get a trade let's you know let's let's let's get the queen centralized okay how about we do that we do have to be careful as if that's that's a very nice move by the way pinning our Pawn to our Queen that's a very nice concept so now our Queen needs protection but this Pawn also needs some protection right so when I'm looking at this I'm thinking all right maybe maybe I have to play rookie eight that was a very nice concept by by the opponent now the opponent could play this right and they're putting some serious pressure I I I was hoping they wouldn't see that by the way I saw Queen G3 but I sometimes I make moves and I'm like you know I don't always want to play like a 2400 this move works if I take something but I don't have to take I could just I could I could push that's why it was better to play Rook e one so I I I mean it's a little but there might be Rook e one anyway by the way there might be Rook E1 anyway F4 was was an interesting concept see will they play Rook E1 they didn't they didn't play Rook E1 I can still maybe now I'll just play F5 make sure you know and also play Rook F5 tough decision how about we play Let's Play F5 this just looks right this just looks right and now we can continue to try to do something over here how about we rotate we try to take now that we know this is super solid and we're trying to stay up at least a minute on the clock let's try to open that side of the board up right we're we're putting pressure they can't go here because we take they could try to make a pawn break but we don't have to take it's not Checkers I like this okay if we take they're trying to open you know they're trying to get some trades so maybe maybe just something like Queen B6 just slow steady notice that at this level a lot of it is like these slow moves nobody's doing anything drastic nobody's doing anything crazy nobody's chopping everything down notice how long the pawns have stared at each other at 1500 that's very very normal now we can take now we can take because the queen no longer guards The Rook continuity they just went here to protect the Rook we couldn't take because we didn't want them to control the file when they play Queen B3 now we take that's the difference now they're going to lose material they go here oh that is a that is a very fortunate move for us C4 attacks The Rook if I move the Rook it's discovered check on our queen that is crazy C4 is a great find by my opponent that is an excellent find Now The Rook right if I move the Rook C5 is a discovered attack on my queen that is is Brad is nuts so what I have to find here and I and I saw this I saw this from a distance I can't take because of this what I have to take is this Pawn threatening that Rook that's a tough find and that is the only reason none of this works is because I have this and I get the Rook back and I'm winning I'm winning because I'm going to take the pawn and then we're going to trade a bunch of pieces and life is going to be good that is probably the best move by the way um and so now I have to you know I got to protect myself like you know do I take with the Rook here probably that's probably what yeah that's probably the best move that I take with the Rook I'm attacking the queen in this and I mean C4 was was almost almost winning I mean almost winning that was an excellent move and and I and I and I I saw it but I was going to kind of talk about it in the game review I can't talk about everything quickly and thoroughly uh do I have anything here I mean the easiest by far is to trade the Rooks you don't even think you just trade the Rooks and you just need to make sure there's no you know there's nothing here so I'm going to I'm going to trade the rook and now we just have to not blunder anything we can just take the pawn I would give some checks by the way I would just give a few checks because you never know what's going to happen and actually in this case we're going to win a pawn with a check it's always good to win pawns with check like that has to be good and so now when the King goes to the the first rank again what I would do here is I I would play the simple move as long as there's no Perpetual check I would just get rid of this Pawn cuz now even if they win this and even if they win this we're going to hide we're going to hide so I would you know probably the best move is to protect I would just take pawns like that's you know that's the easiest they're going to but now our King is safe as long as you avoid more checks you avoid more checks and now we're winning um the easiest way to win is to probably just push the pawn like this oh my goodness I don't know why I'm sneezing so much so now a lot of things win taking the pawn wins even trading the Queens wins uh we have a check that's probably the most instructive we can play check Force the king up and then force a queen trade and then the pawn promotes but there was a lot of ways to win could have also now this is winning and um make sure no no stalemate I think my opponent's going to go here okay cut the cut cut the king off give a check win the pawn and now the easiest thing just like last game we make a second Queen every move is a check check boom boom boom boom same exact technique wins you every game that was a great game by my opponent my opponent played super well that game and they they fought very very well and you'll notice that at the 1500 level a lot of people sort of play this kind of solid system um and and you know in the game I I I try to play relatively solidly and and straightforward Bishop G6 is not the best move it was better for me to play Bishop G4 and be a little bit more aggressive try to create this weakness for my opponent but I went here and I you know I thought I I thought I played fine this was all normal and yes indeed the best move was this because after Rook B1 I can play for example Queen E7 and defend this Pawn because of this trick and now my you know that that that's a little tough to spot I think even at 1500 so I went here we were we were kind of you know slightly better maybe here uh the computer by the way does want me to take with the pawn and go up and use my and that and that that is instructive that my king is actually safe I may or may not have known that but again I I I'm trying to put you through the you know the brain of a person playing and U my opponent did a very decent job I mean this was you know I thought I kind of demonstrated the right way to put pressure uh in this type of position I had a beautiful tactic here by the which is C5 and sacrificing my queen yeah that's really really nice um and um that uh you know if Pawn takes I had this and that's kind of brutal right um now in this position Queen takes yeah that's that's sort of the end once we start breaking in it's bad news um we get in and I think it was just basically totally winning yeah and now yeah this is unfortunately this is unfortunately the end of the game now there is one tricky thing here by the way if my opponent went here this move is a draw because it's a stalemate and white can sack the queen Queen oh that's so brutal oh my goodness I just saw that in the stockfish lines oh my gosh Queen G oh that's a draw that is why you never resign but I thought I did a nice job and you know luckily I I avoided that I can I if I blundered that that would have been crazy my next opponent is not online I need to tell them to get online please go to play online refresh sometimes it happens you're you're sort of logged out um but yeah this was really creative by my opponent C4 and this is the only winning move and just so you understand like if the position was uh let's say even this this is losing because I can't attack The Rook I can't attack The Rook which is kind of nuts yeah so so that was very nice that was very nice all right um my next opponent seemingly uh cannot figure out how to get a game going I don't know what's happening I'm going to try to start the game again let's see what happens says are not online okay if it says they're not online then I'm going to try to challenge them to a game instead of starting the game by myself so stay tuned maybe we'll put a commercial break may may maybe the commercial will be uh just you know my get a course get a course from me how about that all right I'm going to just send them a challenge there we go formal fallacy okay first game I played D4 I've been playing a few um I've been playing a few englishes uh let's play E4 this game maybe I'll go back to D4 for the next one okay Sicilian um there's a lot of lines against the Sicilian Defense one of my favorites is A3 let's see what my opponent does this is in my E4 course so if this game goes well if this game goes well you got to check out the E4 course get it 20% off this is the most common response by black all Sicilian players play all these different Sicilians but the second you play A3 suddenly they all play Knight C6 now this is playing directly into the Gambit so if you don't take of course I'm going to go B5 and that feels unpleasant as a person playing the Sicilian with black you kind of don't want to take this Pawn you kind of don't want to so a lot some people will strike in this you know they'll try to do something else but if you don't take I'm going to play B5 and you know what's funny is that A6 stops B5 but it doesn't because I can still play B5 and now this is a bit psychologically rattling for some people taking the pawn is not bad for black but it's understandably dangerous and now suddenly we are completely throwing a Sicilian Defense player out of their comfort zone because do they go home do they go to E5 like what do they if they play Knight D4 we will boot them around the center a little bit more so already in five moves we have a 1700 completely you know like running around right in fact I think we can win the Knight we can just chase the Knight down D4 here but what about F4 Knight G6 can I just play F5 maybe not there's a nice move there that might that might save my opponent I would be very curious to see if my opponent F found this move if I play F5 there is a ridiculous defense if the Knight just runs around I'm just going to trap it but F5 there might be E6 creating a threat of this check which is crazy I mean if that I mean if that works that is that is really really wild we got to analyze that I I I don't want to risk it because I don't want to get into a bad position but that is really instructive F5 E6 I mean I I kind of want to play into it just to see if my opponent would spot it but I also don't want to get myself into a bad position what do we do I'm so conflicted let's go for it it's not the best move because of this completely and then like I I I have to make sure I'm not like losing there uh E6 would be would be wild if they F if they I mean I don't know you know I don't know at se is that a 1700 level move maybe if I played F5 very quickly my opponent would have like not suspected anything is up but uh know E6 is one of those moves that you kind of come up like come up with a desperation and they can't hear me just so like my opponent's not in my walls I would hope so yeah they didn't find it they didn't find it and now the Knight is trapped although I think they're trying to ah they're doing it this way they're doing it this way that is very interesting I don't think it works but I but it is a very interesting idea because I can just walk up to the you know I like if I take the queen is very very powerful but what if I just protect my like what if is there anything wrong with Queen G4 I'm trying to figure this out anything wrong with Queen G4 I don't see anything wrong with Queen G4 and you don't have to take just so it's not Checkers so I think I'm just GNA go Queen G4 and I think I'm just gonna win this Knight and that might be already the end of the game if Pawn takes by the way if Pawn takes I can just take the Knight I don't have to take the pawn back yeah but now I'm going to take and the difference is that this is only a check with a bishop so I can hide my king and as long as I don't lose anything or do anything really dumb it's a it's a very big Advantage it's a very big Advantage now Bishop F6 protects this and ooh that is very creative if if I take I get forked very tricky at 1700 they set traps and this is very very instructive uh do I go back to the third rank or do I go here I kind of want my knight there but I also like my queen there so I'm I'm not sure um yeah I'm not sure I don't know it all looks kind of okay I think I should be a little more active with my queen I expect Bishop F6 although Knight F6 is probably also fine and I'm up a night like our A3 Sicilian got us a winning position in less than 10 moves against obviously a very good player so we still don't have to take here we can play Bishop B2 um we can finish our development here I mean it looks really appetizing to put the bishop out I it just feels good to have more pieces in the game because right now I don't have a lot at all and also I have a very weird position with this King and it's a little bit dangerous Plus now this bishop kind of lost contact but I do have to be careful I mean you know there there are still plenty of ways to potentially lose so I should be sure to be defensive uh some of you by the way like I always talk about simplifying when you're winning a bishop F6 is probably fine but I would not be so Hasty to give away such a bishop I mean it's a very nice looking bishop and I really don't want to I really don't want to traded off you know so Queen B6 okay is there a threat no is there a threat actually no cuz I'm defended so I mean I can just develop I wouldn't develop this way because then I'm blocked could maybe get my knight out I could offer a queen trade right could do a handful of things here I think but probably the easiest move and the move I have to think about the least is Knight to H3 it's it's not really where I want my knight but it's just getting a piece out it's protecting F2 from this idea I could have moved my Bishop there or there probably as well at some point black will move the rook and this will become a reality I cannot take because of this and you when you are up a piece you don't not all pawns are the same you don't really care about every like you don't want you don't need need to preserve every single Pawn the pawns kind of change value as the game is going on a little bit you know um so I would not be that concerned if I get another E4 in the next game I'll probably play a Caro Khan or I'll play a modern I I kind of feel like playing something on the sixth rank so this is this is a very weird position this is like you know the opening went well and we obviously you know we got an advantage and you know they tried to play very creatively and defense I ly but D5 D5 is a very interesting move just trying to get aggressive so if I take they're going to take with the pawn or the Knight if I don't take they're going to take me so if as long as you're not creating massive problems for yourself trading is probably in general going to be fine like we take a quick moment to glance okay the Knight is coming here you know uh I am being messaged by my wife I think yes she is traveling home on the train my opponent took I promise I'm not getting assistance okay this looks like a good move to me this the bishop is targeting the pawn yeah I mean Rook here looks pretty reasonable I also like Knight C3 just attacking this Pawn that seems pretty straightforward right we're just threatening the pawn and also my opponent's king is still in the center so there might be moments for me to to attack if black castles they walk directly into this rook and directly into that bishop and and I do like that very much this bishop has sort of lost its power it's really not doing a whole lot anymore it also kind of looks trappable like uh Queen F4 does look very you know they will block that that the reason I'm not playing this is I I'm already seeing that the Knight can get in the way um but can't I just trade isn't the trade good for me I guess they're trying to I mean I don't see a punishment for this move so I'm going to take and just to slow you down here there there's a very interesting move I could play which is Queen E4 of course I'm I'm going to take but Queen E4 check attacks the Knight and the bishop and the king so you know the bishop might have to come back but you know for Simplicity we're going to go here there's a cool move here which is Bishop C6 I can take but then I lose this that looks dangerous it's not that dangerous because I can save my Rook by playing Rook C1 I can also just with the pawn on that square suddenly the king becomes very weak for black um okay but now I'm getting also isn't this a free Bishop Rook G1 also looks like it's very also Queen D4 is a queen trade guaranteed cuz I'm threatening the queen and mate if I go here what if what is my move if black plays Rook d8 there is no move technically there's like one small move but that is more than enough to get me to say yeah I'm good I'm fine I don't I don't want to get wrapped up in any of that um Queen D4 though is a guaranteed Queen trade and then after takes takes we're winning they're probably going to get a pawn but we do have a winning Advantage Rook G1 they're going to come back and play defense with the bishop me personally I mean I think the best move in the position is maybe to take the bishop but Queen D4 just strikes me as like the the you can't lose move there's also absurd moves like Rook A4 attacking the bishop I I should speed up though you'll notice I don't have a lot of time what about Bishop D4 by the way this is just something that that dawned on me then maybe Queen H6 it's all weird it's all really weird I'm going to play Simple chess I'm going to trade queens and then we're winning but they're going to have a little bit you know they're going to have something to say about it it's not as easy as we would like but being up a night is better than not being up a night we spent way too much time on that move one and a half minutes obviously too much time um we want to play it a little bit bit faster but it is what it is now if they take the Rooks are staring at each other yes of course I anticipated this move this is under attack now but we don't have to defend against that yet instead I can play Rook G1 and I can just I'm going for my own stuff as well G6 is possible um Bishop G6 getting in the way as possible F6 is possible as well blocking the bishop Bishop G4 is a check if they do that I think I'm going to play Bishop E2 I think I'm going to trade and still continue to go for that and lowkey super lowkey that pawn is now actually hanging so Pawn has not been under attack for about 10 moves uh but now it is so yeah G6 indeed I can take the pawn I mean the pawn is free it's not free because the bishop is targeting my night so the thing about these how to win a chess episodes like sometimes my brain just stops working halfway through you know there like too much chess uh well if it's not free then um I'm going to have to start you know bringing some more pieces into the game I'm going to have to play Knight F4 so um crazy game I mean definitely a game where black is creating a lot of counterplay even though I'm up a piece it's it's not proving to be easy whatsoever this is attacking this listen I think the by far the easiest thing to do here is just to play Bishop D3 like let's just trade some pieces if Bishop takes I'm going to take with the Knight and then we the the less pieces black has way and I don't want to double my Pawn so I think I'm going to play this and yeah now I'm winning this is under attack again I could you know probably dance out of the way but let's just create a bulletproof Central structure that our opponent can't get past and now let's go convert and win the game so I'm going to play Rook B1 going to play Rook D5 probably right then I might play Knight F4 then Rook F5 okay so maybe I'm going to try to get a rook trade maybe I'm gon to play that's the best move and I can't play Rook e one it's proving to be very very very annoying very difficult position but again we have two minutes we can't you know we can't overthink so let's play Rook F1 let's just kind of play quickly Let's see we have a knight for two pawns and the two pawns are not particularly good pawns so the more trades we can get the faster we can get those trades the better we're going to try to cause problems cause problems with the night now we're both in the two-minute Mark last time I got really low on time I'm trying to be instructive but then I get two minutes and and then it's pandemonium so I'm trying to be instructive but I but I got to win the game I got to win the games and you know 1,700 is is not easy if I just try to sit down and win the game you know as as fast as possible it will be easier but let's go night B4 we're targeting the Knight not no we're not targeting the Knight that is not a knight we're targeting The Rook if this maybe I have some x-ray stuff skewer get a tra make my life easier been talking about it more trades we can get the better less pieces black has less headache for me yeah I'm looking at Bishop F6 I don't see anything wrong with Bishop F6 so I'm going to play it anywhere The Rook moves I'm going to take the bishop right now here I could maybe throw an H3 by the way but I don't think it does anything so let's trade this is under attack now let's protect it so now they don't have a bishop so now we have to get the Rook into the game we have to get the Knight into the game and in the interest of time we should take as much stuff as we can while protecting all of our pieces easier said than done another way to play this position is to just go for a Checkmate like just go and try to get a mate um I'm going to go Rook A7 trying to get this Pawn feel like black will probably play Rook C7 just to show you like it's not easy to win this position Ah that's a big mistake because now I get over there and now now we're going to start cleaning up now we see the advant Vantage of having the extra piece CU this piece is going to come back in different paths and it's going to cause problems uh we can take on B6 nothing is hanging boom now we're just up a knight no questions asked now we're going to be up a knight and a pawn and very quickly Black's Position will disintegrate now I have a feeling black might try to trade with us okay now we are a knight and a Pawn King is always safe like now it's just a cleanup process now we're going to get the Knight to the middle and start pushing I wouldn't mess around here if we have option to trade a rook we trade The Rook but if not just go we have an option to trade a rook we can't push this we also can't push that it's kind of annoying um all right let's bring the Knight to the middle then bring the Knight to the middle somehow are they going here they might it's good idea maybe not a bad move it is definitely there yeah I'm going to play Knight F4 probably have something maybe slightly more accurate but Knight F4 they're going to take good good counter play now in the interest of simplifying this is probably best and now we go for this Pawn so now we're going to try to win both of these pawns and now by far the easiest way to play this position is to simp oh that is a great I should have brought my king closer that way that was silly I'm making this a little bit more complicated for myself now let's go C4 we're in a pawn race H4 this is protected but it's getting a little too comp it's getting a little too close for comfort for me now this is the best move now I think I can sacrifice and probably win take Rook takes take Tak C6 h37 we're queening at the same time crazy so maybe oh man this is nuts I made this way more complicated than I had to funny all right oh let's keep our night let's keep our night again I'm making this way more dramatic I don't know what I'm like I don't know why I'm doing all of this that's Checkmate that is a Checkmate threat um King H7 is H that unfortunately loses the pawn it's not made but it's a great game by my opponent I just I just want to give the props where they're due now the easiest way of course we're just going to we're just going to push so we're going to protect everything we're going to push this is a great game by by by black though and sometimes it's hard for me because like I I know I I got a win but I'm also trying to give my let's give a check just make sure we're back here and we're just gonna we're just this move blunders of fork that we don't have to take but taking was probably best by the way now we are we are winning that's a nice move too cuz the queen can promote but I do have a backwards check uh there was multiple ways to win no stalemate because the king can actually go back to G5 give some checks every move should be check and we will check all the way down until mate that was a great game I mean what what what can I say like that was that was really well done that was really well done and uh our opponent um really played fantastic now in the opening the A3 Sicilian got us a major advantage so we uh we were winning and here yeah E6 is the best move that is the only move that doesn't get black into a losing position this does get black into a losing position it still was not over um and probably you know here I could have been a little bit more precise but we had a major advantage here and what we should have done instead of playing Knight C3 which was probably fine we should have went for the bishop allowed this but then disallowed black from castling that's what we should have done the way it happened in the game is actually Black's game got prolonged quite a lot and we got ourselves into an end game where you know we were better and you know convincingly better but we still had to work really hard and I I thought I was pretty instructive with how I did this but I allowed a little bit too much like I this everything I allowed here was was a bit much and it was a bit instructive the way my opponent stacked the Rooks and won this Pawn I thought that was very clever the way they did it I did not have to allow it to that extent I kind of I don't know I sort of was letting the game go and and and seeing what happened but um next game I got to shut down the counterplay faster I want to win the next game a little bit faster uh CU that game was definitely losable it was definitely losable uh and um so uh okay my fourth and fifth opponent might need to switch uh I'm going to say all right we are switching opponents because one of my opponents is going to the is in the airport and is uh actually wants to get on a plane so a lot of a lot of stuff a lot of moving Parts in this episode uh and now that person isn't online ah there we go okay I'm going to play D4 and I think you know against the 2200 I got to focus and I got to play fast this game this is the strongest opponent of the day probably a young player as well last week I lost to like a 13-year-old 2250 rated player um okay the game aborted let's play D4 a lot of drama in this episode a lot okay the game aborted again this is actually getting frustrating now oh my goodness this is crazy stuff there we go all right tremendous D4 D5 um there's a lot of there's a lot of things we could play Let's play a Jo let's play a jobava London um well C C5 is is a is a pretty aggressive move uh I will play Knight C3 anyway Knight C3 if takes I will take with the queen of course takes Queen takes then we play aggressively with E4 get the bishop out as well uh that's a move I think E3 is is completely reasonable here might be some E4 stuff as well I can't play Knight B5 right away if anybody's wondering Queen A5 check I need to play this first and um CD4 CD4 is a complete completely reasonable line and now this Knight C3 Bishop F4 London is uh putting a little pressure with moves like Knight B5 but we'll also play Knight F3 Bishop D3 we'll play these kind of yeah A6 is completely standard I might be able to take on C5 now and against E5 this Pawn is still hanging so I might have this E5 Bishop here but I would avoid positions where you're giving up such a big Center to the opponent so instead I'm just going to play Knight F3 I think this is completely normal I'm going to play Knight F3 but now dc5 is starting I don't know I mean it opponent is just letting me do it which makes me think it's you know maybe okay to play like that like DC E6 and Knight A4 for example uh Knight E4 to try to win the pawn back I might have something there but I don't know and since I don't know I'm a little bit scared to do it and I don't want to do it so I'm going to play A3 which actually sets up this move because the next move I will play B4 it's a pretty it's a pretty solid position again I I'm I'm I'm playing in a obviously playing a very very strong player um so I don't want to fall behind on time uh we are going to to be learning ourselves the same way I'm teaching you I'm also going to be you know I'm going to be teaching myself last time I got into a very very bad position against my opponent and I spent way too much time so this time we're going to try to play yeah Bishop G4 is a is a normal move I wonder if I can take on C like every move I'm thinking about taking on C5 but let's just play Bishop E2 after takes takes takes takes we'll just castle and so just Castle now I can also play Knight E5 which could be an interesting transformation of the position but let's just Castle I think my opponent will play Bishop D6 and now again I'm I'm looking at Knight E5 as a possibility puts a little bit of pressure on the black position but nothing you know nothing crazy taking sometimes is an option as well uh going back to G3 I think though is is like by far the easiest you generally don't want to take unless there's some very clear payoff so take take I'm going to be fine um I do have to be a little bit worried about sometimes there is some Queen B6 stuff but it's nothing nothing too dangerous for example takes takes take take and then my opponent goes for some sort of Queen B6 but that that shouldn't work okay that's interesting now I am considering Knight takes instead of Pawn takes like normally you take with a pawn but you know may maybe we will get an interesting imbalance game if I take with a knight now the bishop see each other right okay they take like this so taking with the Queen the Knight or this Knight is possible they all are possible I take with the queen I end up with a pawn in the center of the board I take with a c Knight I don't know I can also take with a d Knight Queen T strikes me as the most normal but then I have to transfer my you know my my my pawns um I'm not huge fan of that so how about I take with my C Knight positions equal we're going to try to try to figure out something over here uh to me Queen D3 looks pretty natural advancing with C4 trying to play like Rook C1 and C4 looks quite nice as well uh I am a little concerned if my opponent like takes and puts a queen on B6 I've been talking about Queen B6 like basically the entire game so let's play Queen D3 it's very tough to switch gears from 1300 1500 1700 to opponent that can beat me if if I'm not careful and if I play a bad game okay Knight E4 yes I was expecting this move especially as a result of no longer having the sufficient coverage of that square but I do think after C4 I I I at Knight E4 I can play C4 which I do like and so now the pawn can't take and I'm getting a bit more space I think this is a good response to this move to this move rather I'm already malfunctioning mentally um I can take with the Knight I mean I think taking with the H Pawn is completely natural oh did I blunder a fork oh my goodness I blundered Knight E5 oh these 2200s are too much oh my goodness second time really yeah wow so C4 was a mistake because after Knight takes G3 there is Knight E5 with a fork oh that's brutal okay so Queen B3 probably I have to play right so Queen B3 I attack the pawn on B7 while my Pawn is hanging here it's getting tactical it's going to take with a knight I can I take on B7 or am I going to get my queen trapped I mean at this point I'm I'm [Music] I'm skeptical of everything right so we're both trading Rook B8 I have this I'm I'm very worried I'm going to get my queen trap but I but I don't really see what else I can do queen A5 I can play B4 Queen A4 I can play Knight C3 again Rook B8 I take and then I mean I I don't think my queen is getting traed okay it's just it's just turning into a a tactical game now so this is protected I can probably get a rook trade I get a rook trade I might lose the pawn on A3 from the Knight which I don't like I'm not sure I like anything in this position because this is also a threat which would remove the defense um okay and I'm down two minutes I don't know if I'm playing poorly or or uh I mean I I don't know like I I maybe it's just tough to to go up the level every single episode seriously like I'm playing completely poorly okay let's go Knight C3 to avoid any of those tactics okay think I got to trade the queens now we have an end game right think I got to advance I don't see anything better I'm definitely not you know doing great here definitely not doing great oh we'll try our best a should B4 don't know might need to plop my knight on B5 might need to plop my knight on E2 I just hope the series doesn't turn into how to win at chess except against 2200 rated players who are in their teens that would be very sad I think a rook trade is good I I I like my outside pass pawn and in the end game it feels like in the end game the outside pass Pawn is more of an asset than it is a liability so I think I'm going to offer a rook trade probably my opponent should go here I mean I I I'm really not sure though if that's if that's the best way to play I'm saying probably because it is pretty complicated I think a rook trade is not good for black I think black needs the Rooks to pressure the pawn but I am completely not positive about that hypothesis hypothesis if Rook here I might just go all the way to the seventh rank Rooks on the seventh rank are very good in the end game although I don't actually know what I am doing there uh but hopefully something okay I like that 37 seconds have gone off Black's clock and I also like the fact that a lot of time is being spent now okay I don't think the Rook trade benefits black however we will see okay Rook on the seventh yeah this is how we're going to start playing this end game now Rook on the seventh rank always monitoring when I can advance maybe putting a knight on B5 maybe putting my king in the center I definitely don't have any Edge whatsoever and I got to start thinking of like even what I want to trade I mean maybe I can put a knight on B5 and play for E4 trade this off okay this looks smart this configuration looks very smart everything protects everything if my opponent goes for a trade I will defend you know I will take and I will defend myself so that looks pretty reasonable to me um more than anything else I have to catch up on the clock as well I want to play King F1 I don't see if I'm blundering anything famous last words by the way I might not see it doesn't mean it's not happening so okay we both have four four minutes I am catching up on the clock I'm going to have to be very careful walking my king here because if I go to D3 there is a fork which would be really tragic after all that hard work maybe The Rook isn't better there it's better on like D7 but then there's also another Fork so yeah I am not sure I am not sure how we are going to make progress E4 there is D4 so Knight to B2 yes now I do have Knight C7 no I don't I do not have Knight C7 okay I don't have anything I don't have anything actually okay so I'm going to go for F4 oh that was really stupid because he can just take what am I doing what I mean that was a crazy move KN B2 didn't see that at all but I feel like that's pretty standard at this point so now I can probably trade trading is I mean I I I would think trading is uh is is the right decision here to just try to hold this endgame somehow um but let's try to create active counterplay and let's try to um let's try to you know let's try to have a little bit of fun oh that was just unbelievably stupid as well because now my opponent is going to play Knight E4 and I'm probably just lost oh this is so frustrating I have what am I doing yeah I mean I'm playing really badly like it's it's actually it's instructive but it's so frustrating to lose like this I mean I'm just going to be two pawns down like I'm trying to like make a good example at least and this is just this is terrible chess it's very frustrating to play chess like this I mean I just I'm missing every thing all right I'm active at least I have that going for me but I mean my opponent's just going to go here and here like I don't there's no point being active if you're going to get checkmated um I need some breathing room for my king probably so this is what I'm going for just down two pawns just down two Pawns though yeah and so now I mean I can go here and try to create some counterplay against the king as long as I don't get checkmated as long as I don't get checkmated uh we're still fighting we're still fighting Rook B2 Rook here Rook you know Rook here looks bad looks like I'm going to lose this Pawn I might have like Knight d8 I might I mean Knight E5 is probably the move you should play but but it all looks horrible like I think this is probably best I don't know but this is awful awful Chess By Me So Bad and great chess by my opponent I think this 2442 is is probably pretty deceiving that is definitely not my ability in Rapid chess okay I have some activity that's what I'm going for that's all I have all I have going for me right now is the fact that I have a little bit of active pieces and I need to make sure my king doesn't get checked so I can't like blunder a fork maybe I need to hang out on H4 I just I have to hang out somewhere that I'm not going to you know catastrophically lose the game in one move okay Knight D6 yeah so I guess my opponent is rep positioning to F5 maybe I play King here or is that like I mean it it would be fitting if if I lost this way like trying to reposition myself this is not a fork yeah I can take this Pawn but it might all be losing I mean it really might all be losing because of this pin The Rook is also under attack I think I'm blundering something like Rook G8 eight Knight E5 oh they blundered The Rook I'm not even sure it's that good I'm not even sure it's that good was the crazy part okay King F6 is probably drawish check we repeat I don't know yeah I mean we might repeat moves and then I'm I mean playing this end game for a win is very very silly I don't think I can win this end game King is just going to come around here I mean I think I should take the draw and I think my opponent's going to take the draw too yeah yeah there's nothing better here um May maybe I can play Rook C3 and and but the thing is black can ALS always create this type of blockade and uh yeah that was [Music] um yeah I mean my opponent just I mean what can I say they played very very well uh this was all all quite good this trade was good Knight E4 was was smart I mean there was a lot of ways that and then yeah this is crazy not seeing that is um really indicative of the fact that um I I mean this is just a bit too long of of an episode like my brain just gets fried after staring at the screen for 90 minutes um because of course C4 I am looking at Knight E5 and I'm like oh it just doesn't work and then you know they find that uh C4 was not good I should have probably taken the bishop first and then probably tried to do something else we got into big tactical game um oh my God KN A5 was just winning no but this is awful I mean this is just this is completely horrendous like [Music] I this series is is is is for me also I I have to learn how to like mentally switch from playing an opponent who's 13400 to 2200 because I really I'm really struggling like I'm I'm the last two episodes I I am not playing that level I'm not seeing any Knight A5 just traps my queen and then I would have had to play on down a piece um but I was just worse like the whole game I mean this was crazy like this was terrible I mean I was I mean I missed Knight B2 I didn't even see Knight B2 and this is a completely winning end game for sure where my opponent went wrong was first of all first of all I don't think that they should trade actually I think I think that they should create an outside pass Pawn this is instructive and then they should just try to go for my king with the outside pass pawn and I can't do much here I was ready to resign if H4 happened I would have had to I don't even know I would have done some completely ridiculous thing I who who knows what I would have done um but yeah I mean atrocious atrocious by me very very bad for a second week in a row once my opponent gave me this and I had a little bit of activity actually you'll notice it's - 1.4 so here it's like minus three and then here it's - 1.4 and and and now it's -.6 so it's instructive that even though you are two pawns down in an end game if you get sufficient activity like I have and my opponent is very passive you're actually not losing completely so yeah and um but I want to get this game off the screen as fast as possible I want to play a Norwegian pepega maybe this is a Magnus maybe I'm ending the uh the episode by playing against uh Magnus okay D4 I'm going to play a uh a modern um okay my opponent switches it back to E4 right I can play D6 and A6 and then we will we will see what happens we're going to see which is my opponent going to play aggressive or they G they do play aggressive okay are they going to play like mega super aggressive or are they going to play like not not mega super aggressive it's a long episode oh my goodness I am tired you know what I should do I should start with the best players I would be more fresh this is all very standard this is called the three pawns attack or the Austrian attack and then white likes to go for this E5 Advance what black likes to do is create counterplay with these pawns create counterplay like this and the main line here goes something like Bishop here E5 Bishop E4 but there's a lot of ways to play this A3 is generally not a good move because B4 was not such a massive threat but okay A3 is very reasonable and um the way that black tries to attack white now is with the c Pawn Knight D7 and and C5 um some people like to play instead of Knight D7 they like to play E6 just preventing white from advancing and then playing like Knight F6 that does not look like the way you're supposed to play this position let's play Knight F6 E5 we have KN we E5 we have Knight G4 and also E5 we have Knight D5 so we can just trade and this is yeah the modern defense is very fun it's a little bit it's a little bit exotic a little bit weird you get some very interesting Dynamic positions and uh this game I'm also just trying to play a little fast because my brain is completely fried so there's also that I'm going to go Knight here and I'm going to try to play for C5 if my opponent plays E5 I have two possible moves which are put the Knight there attacking the bishop and also a little bit more calm putting the Knight there getting a trade with the bishop and I don't know which one is better I Knight G4 the bishop is under attack move honestly I've had a long day I'm just going to try to trade the knights so let's try to trade like this my Bishop will stand in the center of the board and the bishop will be good there we go I like the minute advantage that we have in the opening very frustrated with how I played that last game though very very bad Queen E2 C5 castling is probably fine uh there's no immediate threat to our position C5 if they take C4 might just win a bishop by the way by the way by the way uh it might just straight open a bishop but uh of course they don't have to do that they could like take for example I don't know which way they're going to Castle too so I I don't I don't know where I should start an attack which is sort of annoying so we could just play something like E6 and wait E6 prevents E6 and now white will tell us probably right now where they're going to Castle they might not they might play A4 which would be super annoying but that's that's life if A4 I think I'm going to Castle because I think if this position opens up okay that that that at least tells me they're going to Castle short which means I can probably ALS Castle short because if I'm castling short and they're castling short then at least I won't get checkmated which should be should be nice um um I like the concept of Knight B6 and then Knight C4 C5 they can now take but C5 takes I am still trapping this bishop so maybe C5 takes and then we just take C5 take we can also take that way I'm going to try to keep the position as simple as possible because I don't really have the mental capacity at the moment to calculate all of this stuff I really don't like I am actually just very tired so how about we go to this diagonal I'm going to go Queen B7 and control the diagonal that's what that's what we're going to do I anticipate something like this and some attack by my opponent but I think by getting the queen you know in line with our Bishop here we will have some good chances it's a very closed position right now so we both have eight pawns that are sort of Locked Up okay my opponent's just trying to Checkmate me that's what it's come to let's go here going to get crazy when my opponent plays F five it's G to get C okay C3 we are about a clash and crazy stuff is going to happen also because there are so many pawns on dark squares a bishop trade like this actually isn't that bad the question is when do I do it that is that that is really the question um I can also take here first I can also play a move like F5 wild there are so many possibilities in this position I mean F6 also looks very interesting just just open up that side of the board I mean F6 is a crazy move F6 is crazy like so many things are staring at each other right now the tension in this position is nuts everything can take everything I can take take take take take take take everything can take my Bishop is very strong though my light scored Bishop is very powerful standing in the center bunch of uh pawns for my opponent on dark squares so since they have so many pawns on dark squares this bishop is pretty bad compared to the light squared Bishop which is why it moves like Bishop C4 Bishop E4 like Knight B6 Bishop C4 would be great I would remove that Bishop leaving me with control of the light squares and you know F5 here is um is an insane move just sort of completely exploding the position but I think I have more control I think the way my opponent's pieces are set up I have a little bit more control than they do but very tough to say so very tough to say yeah and so my plan was probably to take this with a knight although Bishop takes to stop Knight G5 looks also pretty reasonable here Knight G5 I can play H6 I can just kick the Knight out very funny if the Knight comes here I can just kick it out like what are you doing there and I always have again not right now but that's sort of a concept that's an idea this is good now I can bring my Rook to defend this Pawn Yeah but my opponent might have just kind of like blanked on this move because I also blanked on this move or maybe not they're they're playing it very quickly that might have all been part of some sort of elaborate plan um I want to trade the Bishops I still think this is probably a good move but at this point my my gauge of what's a good move and what's a bad move is extremely bad I'm having a very difficult time at the moment but maybe fascinating should be for trying to get rid of that Bishop I have talked about it now it's time to be about it getting rid of that Bishop put my queen right there or Knight actually Bishop C1 wow okay um guess the idea is some sort of Pawn here again I kind of want to keep it simple I also kind of want to not keep it simple so I don't know which part of me is going to actually win out in the end I mean G5 does look very annoying I might just take if Queen here I'll probably offer a queen trade oh I blundered this I blundered this all part of the plan though all part of the plan that was not part of the plan it definitely wasn't part of the plan got to like eat some food before I record these episodes this is an in between move check and after which my opponent can take my bishop and they're going to be a pawn up however I will be able to get my king to the side kick out their Queen and probably win a pawn back kind of fortunate kind of fortunate that I like have a response that's kind of potent yeah they're going for it but I'm not sure it's uh now they're going to have to go that way going have to get out of my position and then I'm going to take on G4 so I'm not sure this trans formation is actually going to be good for white in the end of it but it is very scary Rook e 2 is Checkmate by the way all detail Queen B3 Rook E2 is a mate threat which I I think I'm going to go for so that is made uh it also just feels good to activate a rook like that and then I'm going to take the pawn although there is Rook G3 why I didn't take the pawn right away I don't know Rook E2 felt the correct move just not worrying about the pawn and just trying to get as much activity as possible as fast as I could will it come back to bite probably but maybe not but maybe Knight E4 I mean it's a very complicated position Knight E4 I can maybe even trade Queens but I don't know why I would trade Queens down material we double oh but terrible decision- making I mean very bad so this this is this is uh probably my worst how to win a chess episode ever in terms of quality of play I mean I gotta like I'm tell I got to eat a snack or something next time because I'm hungry low blood sugar I'm uh my opponents are playing well I've I've clearly raised some very good Pro proteges uh that's a crazy move the idea of that move is to check bait me but it doesn't work what it doesn't work because the Rook has to play defense what The Rook has to play defense right it's an interesting idea but what if I play something like Queen D5 so the idea is if I move the Knight this is a mate right what if I play Queen D5 and the idea of Queen D5 is that after Rook H3 King G8 we're trading Queens like Queen D5 the queen has to move somewhere I can move my knight anywhere I want basically maybe not anywhere I want but enough of a place of where I want I think it works if I blunder I blunder if they find a winning idea God Bless but this is a very nice concept before your knight which is hanging has to move you use it as a defensive anchor to Target an enemy piece the Knight can't be taken because if I take the queen there is no like if the Knight was taken would check I would lose everything if the Knight was taken and then after I take the queen there would be something I would lose everything but the way it stands I cannot move my knight because my queen is hanging but I can go King G8 and I think I'm winning so I think this is an important move disconnecting the queen from the attack when the queen Retreats I have now improved the position of my queen and made the position of White Queen worse and now I think I can just move the Knight like I can play like even Knight D7 but that seems I don't really Knight D7 looks dangerous for me so I think I'm going to go here move the king here and I'm just up a knight like I don't see and my Rooks are doubled of course there is it's never the end of the story but okay at least I can like can't I trade the Queens here I'm like worried I'm going to blunder basically every move but looks like I can trade the queens and okay with with no queens I won't lose with no queens I won't lose hopefully hopefully still looks a little unpleasant with all these pieces coming but but that allows Rook G4 right that allows Rook G4 at least at least yeah and they resign okay that was a scary game I mean it was a it was a very complicated game it was equal for most of it um taking the pawn is bad very complex game very back and forth battle um taking this is actually a bad move for white because the activity that I get is good it's it's good Rook e 2 is fine Knight takes is fine rookie 2 is fine and even this position despite being one Pawn down I have so much activity it's very difficult for my opponent to make a move and they kind of went all in and sometimes you get called and there is nothing here even by the way Knight H7 is like you you have to have more of an attack then your opponent has defense and they don't cuz I actually have a lot of counterplay there but that was a that was a super complex game I mean it was I played This Modern and it was you know I mean I thought this position is this position was super tense it was an equal game and 1,800 level chest is tough 2200 level chest is tough I'm glad so I've gone four and a half out of five today but I feel like I got like two so I uh I think I I held my nerves in this position I think this was instructive this move F6 like opening up my knight opening up my Rook getting those pieces in the game and I think the quality of Pawns that I pushed in front of my king was better than the quality of Pawns my opponent pushed but but um yeah I think next week I'm going to start with the stronger players I'm going to make them play me when I'm fresh and then they're going to have a tough time that concludes episode 29 again if you want to check out any courses 20 uh they're 20% off for today I played the Scandinavian I played the modern uh I don't think I played any with the white pieces but um they're all there middle games masterclass end games tactics whatever you want to improve check them out for free uh and I will see you next time get out out of here
