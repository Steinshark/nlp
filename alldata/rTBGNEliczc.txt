this is the best interview I've ever had in 
my life I love your line of questioning and um   getting to what what is real I hooked into Tim has 
a childlike quality to him and I stay with that   innocence and that and don't take that innocence's 
weakness or uh and uh when I read the scripture   I I feel truth good evil and I find the good 
and let that just Pierce The Darkness [Music]   hello everyone watching and listening today 
I have the pleasure of speaking to two people   someone you most likely know for his portrayal 
of Jesus of Nazareth in Passion of the Christ   Jim Caviezel and also someone you should know 
if you don't already The Man Behind operation   Underground Railroad Tim Ballard we discussed the 
new film The Sound of freedom wherein Mr cavizo   plays Tim Bellard in the telling of his real life 
story detailing his fight against the increasingly   worldwide and pervasive childhood sex trade the 
film The Sound of Freedom releases on July 4th   so about a week and a half ago I got a text 
message from Tony Robbins uh suggesting that   I watch a new film called the sound of freedom and 
I did that about four days ago with my wife Tammy   and was quite struck by the movie and I decided 
to follow up on it it details out the efforts of   one man Tim Bellard to investigate uh the a child 
sexual slave ring and to rescue the children that   were associated with that but it also points to 
a broader social problem which is the spread of   sexual and slave trafficking worldwide abetted by 
the gnat which is a great Avenue for Psychopathic   criminals to pursue their darkest desires with 
very little risk of being caught especially on   the multinational basis so I've decided to I to to 
reach out to Tim Bellard who is the um the man who   who the movie is about and to Jim Caviezel who's 
the actor that plays him to talk about what all   this signifies and so Tim let's start with you 
I mean the movie makes the case that there is   a widely expanding network of slavery essentially 
making itself manifest worldwide concentrating in   no small part on very young children who 
are being sold repeatedly to pedophilic Psychopaths to have at their will and of course 
can be sold repeatedly for that purpose and the   movie makes the case that this is now an 
operation that's rivaling the drug trade   in magnitude so you know it sounds like yet 
another right-wing conspiracy so please why   don't you walk us through what you know and and 
and help me understand and everybody watching and   listening exactly what you think is going on yeah 
thank you so much uh Jordan we're so grateful uh   you take your time to do this with us so I spent 
12 years as a special agent undercover operator   with the Department of Homeland Security most of 
my time 90 of that time was spent investigating   these cases child crimes child trafficking and in 
fact those numbers are correct uh that are being   this these are Department of Labor U.N these 
are sources that um you know the the best we   have that say that there's close to Six Million 
children or more who are forced into sex slavery   labor slavery or organ harvesting and I can 
attest that I have been involved in in cases   involving all three of those forms of slavery 
multiple times and is absolutely is a real thing   um it's not even far far from home uh it's the 
United States is the number one consumer year   after year of child rate material and oftentimes 
we we're close to number one in production   um and it's a serious matter you know the case um 
the story and the sound of Freedom kicks off with   the rescue of a little boy at the Port of Entry uh 
the southern border that's a real story a real boy   um that I I was on that Port of Entry I was 10 
years on the southern border so when you have 85   000 unaccompanied minors showing up in the last 
two years being let into the country without the   sponsor being vetted DNA checked background 
checked um you know I called the economy of   pedophilia at the United States where the demand 
85 000 children thousands of them are under five   years old are are LED into the country so we 
have we have a serious serious problem and   uh it's it's not being addressed as it should 
be hopefully this film can do that have have   what has been your experience with regard to 
so-called mainstream Media or Legacy media   coverage how much attention has been paid to this 
and if not much why and if reasonably who and how   well I think not not very much has been 
uh you know attention has been given by   mainstream media oftentimes it's more innocent 
than cynical perhaps where it's just this is too   dark I don't want to expose our audience to 
this horrific thing um you know we I I film   we film our operations I mean I I'm going 
to post today another operation in in West   Africa of a baby Factory I mean these are real 
cases where they've they've kidnapped women   um as young as 13 year olds and children and 
they impregnate them they rape them and they   make babies and they take these babies and sell 
them for their organs sell them for sex sell them   for a Satanic ritual abuse like it's it's it does 
sound crazy that's why I film it our operations   we film our operations so that we can show the 
world this is very real it's really happening   um and I think if there's two million children 
forced into commercial sex which is this the   most uh kind of credible statistic that we can 
find a lot of people are involved so there is a   more cynical answer to your question which may 
be there's people that don't want this exposed   the because they're involved in it so I'm going to 
harass you a bit here um from the Wikipedia page   um there is some not that I'm particular 
particular fan of Wikipedia Pages uh depending on   the circumstances but there are some criticisms of 
what you're doing and I thought we might as well   um address them right off the bat bat 
because people who are watching are   going to be look man if I was coming across 
this for the first time and in some ways I am   I've got two choices in front of me don't I I can 
either presume that you've discovered something   that's ongoing and of tremendous significance 
that's terribly dark or I can assume that the   difficult work that you had done for a decade um 
genuinely addressing these problems has made you   hypersensitive to a threat and willing to magnify 
it and it would be easier just to ignore you as a   consequence now that would be the preferable 
um outcome to such an investigation wouldn't   it so you can as as you said you can understand 
why people might want to avert their eyes from   such a thing so I'm going to walk through these 
criticisms and maybe you could you know you can   respond to them and we can get that out of the 
way before we go deeper into the film and and   your your uh in your your uh your operations so 
so your group and this is Operation Underground   Railroad and tell me if I get anything wrong here 
says it devours conspiracy theories though founder   Tom Bellard was criticized for refusing 
to condemn the Q Anon conspiracy theory   um I have no idea what the hell that 
means do you know what that's referring to   yeah absolutely we um that's that's a lie in 
Wikipedia we have absolutely an rfaqs for years   have have condemned the majority of of what we 
see um with conspiracy theories uh so I they like   to attribute me to the Q Anon movement um there 
may be some truths in there but there's so many   falsehoods on top of that so our FAQs refute that 
immediately um because it can it discredits the   movement in fact I would go so far as to consider 
that maybe certain people who don't want this   known are responsible for some of the conspiracy 
theories in order to discredit the movement   um and uh they go too far they go too far in in 
their assessment of things but yeah we absolutely   have just disavowed uh what's generally coming out 
of of Q Anon yeah well it says you know it's very   vague on Wikipedia it says to condemn the Q Anon 
conspiracy theory well I know perfectly well that   there are more than one conspiracy theories let's 
say on Q and on so I'm not even exactly sure what   it's referring to what is there a particular 
conspiracy theory that um you were criticized   for refusing to condemn do you have any more 
specific details about that I mean I I'm not   sure what exactly they're talking about Pro they 
might be uh referring to the fact that there's   something called adrenal Chrome where they take 
they're taking children's blood and devouring it   and so forth uh and I've explained my experience 
with that and and I just did in West Africa and   other places we've seen this in in several parts 
of the continent of Africa and it's very real it's   very real This Witch doctory they take these 
children we they they take their organs they   take their blood they they they drink it they take 
the genitalia of children and and hang it over the   rooftop of their businesses thinking that the the 
dark Gods will bless them these are real things   um and so I might say something like that and 
then they connect it to something uh that a q   Anon person says about you know a celebrity who 
must be doing this too but there's no evidence   to back that and they make they make a false 
connection there um and and so that's that's   the only example I can think of okay got it well 
the next thing it says is that the the operation   underground Railway fall mostly claimed that it 
had entered a partnership with American Airlines   that was in 2022 so what do you what do you what 
do you have to say about that oh there's a great   one so a PR firm uh who represented um us made a 
deal with American Airlines uh came to us and said   shoot the video they're going to put this video 
on your uh we're gonna put there for this video on   the airlines they shot the video of me I just get 
a call from our PR Company to put me in a studio   I give a video that I think I'm talking to the 
passengers for one month uh on American Airlines   apparently the deal fell through the PR Company 
didn't tell us that and our our marketing company   our marketing team put out hey we're going to be 
on American Airlines the PR Company apologized   we had we fired them they said we can't believe 
we didn't get the message to you and that was it   and of course there's people that want so badly 
for us to be wrong or us to not do what we say we   do so they exploited that I think that was a vice 
magazine very incredibly dishonest uh Journal uh I   can't call him journalist us the vice magazine did 
they've done a series of hit pieces on this and I   I encourage people I encourage people to read it 
readvice readvice because everything they say is   so ridiculous and so dishonest right right yes 
well and I I do believe if I remember correctly   the advice is also declared bankruptcy in the last 
few weeks and I can't imagine an organization more   richly deserving there was a 2021 follow-up 
article from Vice but I don't think we're   going to I'll just read part of it because it's so 
ridiculous conflating consensual sex work with sex   trafficking yeah well that's exactly the kind of 
Weasley um what would you call it criticism that   I'd expect from people who were trying to justify 
the sorts of behaviors that you are attempting to   expose um then there's a 2021 article in slate 
criticizing a 2014 raid conducted by operation   underground Railway in the Dominican Republic 
saying that it was likely to have traumatized   the traffic children um Ann Gallagher an 
authority on human trafficking wrote in 2015   that our had an alarming lack of understanding 
about how sophisticated criminal trafficking   networks must be approached and dismantled and 
called the work of our arrogant unethical and   illegal so and have a way of that oh thank you 
I'm grateful for this opportunity so someone   like Ann Gallagher who lives 3000 miles away from 
any operation we've ever done is not qualified to   talk about what our operations she can't give 
any uh details she can't give any examples   um the Slate article is a fun one to address I've 
addressed it several times um we um early on we   brought a blogger down to do to to watch our 
operations we we invite people down but if Tony   Robbins has been down um we invite politicians the 
Attorney General of Utah's coming our operations   um if we're hiding something that's the last thing 
we would of course do so we bring this journalist   this blogger I won't call her a journalist 
um and we thought she was a friend and she   came and watched a legit legitimate operation 
happened in in Dominican Republic there were   seven traffickers who showed up seven traffickers 
arrested there were um 20 plus uh people rescued   nine of them were children you can't you can't 
sometimes you can't always uh control who shows   up to the sting party the traffickers bring 
who they will but nine children uh showed up   they were all liberated from the the the the 
the um you know the control of their captors   um this blogger then wrote two glowing stories 
about it that she witnessed this she had very   minimal exposure to the operation itself 
she she witnessed it some seven years later   she decides to use it in my opinion to 
somehow increase her social media following   as our foundation grew and she writes a story 
it's in slate now here's here's the key thing   um nine children rescued and nine children 
had three years of Aftercare services in   this operation provided by International Justice 
mission one of the top authorities in Aftercare   and and fighting human trafficking um seven 
traffickers were not only arrested but all seven   were convicted so she chose the wrong case to 
criticize now tellingly if if anyone's gonna write   a story about that operation good bad or otherwise 
and they leave out the part that says seven   traffickers were arrested and seven traffickers 
were convicted and nine children were liberated   and had three years of Aftercare to heal them if 
you leave that part out either you are extremely   incompetent as a researcher and writer or you're 
a liar either way the story has zero credibility   on that fact alone that you because she doesn't 
even report on those two on those two essential   elements all right well we've hypothetically 
dispensed with Vice which of course is a   yeah well it's pretty funny that that's what they 
named their organization as far as I'm concerned   and we'll leave the Slate issue aside Jim let me 
ask you a couple of questions if you don't mind   do you want to first of all tell people um about 
your involvement with Angel Studios a little bit   about your career and why this particular movie 
sound of Freedom it's it it's opening what in   early July is it July when does it come out it 
comes out uh July 4th week so next week next week   it's it's it's out in theaters uh Nationwide so 
so let me turn to Jim Jim can you hear me yes yes   all right so yeah do you want to detail out your 
your association with Angel Studios tell everybody   first who Angel studios are what they've done 
and I've watched a lot of the chosen by the way   which I thought was extremely high quality um do 
you tell us about the studio tell us about your   involvement with them about your career and then 
about your attraction to this particular movie   well let's start with the movie first um I 
have three uh adopted children from China   I became aware of the dangers that go on um with 
children around the world and through that process   um then I became aware of Tim Ballard and 
coincidentally then my friend Eduardo verastigi   brought me this script because many of the 
actors that they had offered it to didn't   want to get involved in this particular project 
I read the script I love the movie Taken and I   thought this is like taken but with a much bigger 
heart then Tim Ballard came to the meeting he had   seen two films that I did one was called The 
Count of Monte Cristo and then the other one   was The Passion of the Christ and he felt that 
I'd be the right guy to play him Angel Studios   I had nothing no connection to them until a few 
months ago when they wanted to do this movie   and they wanted their idea was to sell 2 million 
tickets for these two million trafficked children   so why why is it that a number of actors why in 
your estimation did a number of actors turn down   the opportunity to play the role what and and and 
why and why did you decide to forego that risk and   to and to climb aboard I foregoed the risk because 
when you have uh three children that you loved   when you'd give your life for it kind of connects 
into Tim Ballard and Tim did this for this little   girl and the children that he saves it's something 
uh is a greater purpose that even your career   uh you know like I I went through this with Mel 
Gibson when we did the passion that my career   was the last thing I thought of what I thought 
about was the God I love and I put this in how   I look at it is is that this God that I love it 
he loves me and he deserved to be loved back and   so I I would be nothing without him he gave me my 
purpose and this life so um the the Tim Ballard I   was very fortunate that he had seen those um films 
and um when I looked at and I think Tim made this   comparison Schindler's List was a very uh powerful 
weapon but it came 50 years too late this film is   now this is exposing it now during that time and 
I believe that is probably why it's easier to get   an OCTA to do a movie 50 years later there's no 
controversy it's over but the the individuals   imagine if Rwanda if that story had been made 
that movie had been made during that time or   that they could see it you know it you you have 
to look at these situations and understand that   um good people sit back and do nothing and allow 
this evil to occur there's got to be people that   stand up in the time that it occurs and that's 
what drew me to the whole story in the first place   and do you do you how how do you feel about 
the movie now you've seen the movie in its   entirety it's about to be released uh it's a 
fully fledged high quality production I was   particularly impressed by the cinematography um it 
it's also extraordinarily well edited the acting   um I don't want to flatter you but the acting is 
extremely high quality it's very realistic movie   um how how do you how how do you feel about your 
involvement now that everything is done and and   how do you feel about the what would you say 
the production capacity of Angel Studios which   is a relatively you know it's a relatively new a 
relative newcomer on the on the mass entertainment   block when I was sitting next in Tim Ballard and 
he leaned over and he started to weep uh heavily I   knew I did my job so do you want to run us briefly 
through I don't want to give away the entire plot   because that would obviously be pointless but do 
you want to just run this briefly through Jim the   the the the plot of the movie and then I'll turn 
to Tim and fill in some of the background details   of his life and so I play Tim Ballard he's a 
Homeland Security he sets up these um uh sting   operations to take down these very very bad men uh 
to save traffic children and one particular case   one of the traffickers that he takes down earned 
slipachinski uh who's he he rescues this boy and   the little boy turns to him and says will you save 
my sister and Tim goes back gets the direction   from above and from his wife and goes back and 
he sells everything to find this little girl   so what I liked about the script so I've 
noticed that one of the most effective ways   of communicating complex ideas effectively is to 
particularize the problem and so what happens in   this movie is that the broad problem of sexual of 
of slavery and human trafficking and the somewhat   narrower problem of sexual trafficking of 
children is zeroed uh is is what focused   on a particular case and so that gives the movie a 
very powerful narrative underpinning right because   when our problem is particularized and you can see 
how it affects actual specific people's lives it   becomes much more realistic and much more palpable 
and I thought the movie did a good job of that   uh Tim do you want to walk everybody listening 
through let's go back into the details of your   life now you worked for this you you worked we 
worked for the Special Forces per se and who who   are you working for before you decided to forego 
your career and to pursue this the case that we're   describing so I worked for 12 years as a special 
agent and undercover undercover operator for the   Department of Homeland Security the investigative 
division called Homeland Security investigations   10 of those years were spent on the border uh 
tracking child traffickers people who would   exploit children with child exploitation material 
so I really learned a lot in 2006 the laws changed   in the United States and for the first time 
U.S agents were permitted and encouraged to go   overseas and find children who Americans were 
abusing and we could now hold those Americans   accountable as if they had committed that crime 
on U.S soil that's that's what really changed my   life because I started I speak Spanish fluently 
and they sent me overseas South of the Border   that's when my eyes opened up and I started seeing 
the children that I used to only see mostly on the   on the pornography on the child expectation 
material cases um but it was tormenting me uh   the US government unwittingly was because if I 
couldn't find that connection back to the United   States States the American kid or the American 
pedophile I had to come home but the problem   is I've already been exposed to the children 
I've already been exposed to the problem and   oftentimes have made myself debate and in 2012 
I had enough on this case I kind of went more I   went further than otherwise I probably should have 
the movie didn't have time to tell you that there   was another case in Haiti at the same time that I 
was working uh thinking there was a U.S Nexus and   I was told in both instances to come home and you 
couldn't work these cases and that's when I had a   very consequential conversation with my wife and 
I said if I stay here if I do this operation with   or without my badge it doesn't matter at this 
point I I'm I can do the work we will save kids   um and um but I I have to lose my job and we have 
six children and this is this is a moral dilemma   like I've never faced in my life and I was hoping 
my wife would have responded with get your ass   home you can't you can't abandon us you know first 
of all you're gonna die without the top cover of   the US government if you continue this and who's 
going to pay the bills and feed the feed the kids   she didn't say that she said to me you have to 
quit your job it was that easy for her um it   became spiritual for her even she felt a calling 
and a responsibility that she might have to reckon   with one day when she meets her maker and I knew 
that she felt that way when she told me this in   the crucial moment of decision about two days 
before I ended up turning my badge and gun over   and and went private she said to me I will not let 
you jeopardize my salvation by not doing this and   when she said those words and I knew she meant 
those words that changed everything for me and   we jumped into really just an irrational Act of 
service I might call it because it wasn't rational   in many in many ways but ultimately it ended in 
the operation UC depicted in the film which shows   54 children uh some uh some adult young young 
adult women were in that group as well rescued   on that island but what the movie doesn't uh have 
the time to report is that in actuality was 120   um there was two other locations being taken down 
at the same time and there's a documentary that's   going to follow uh in in the wake of sound of 
Freedom called triple take Angel Studios will   put it out uh documenting the entire story and so 
in the end it was successful and we were able to   build upon that success and I founded operation 
Underground Railroad I run another Foundation   that was founded by Glenn Beck called the Nazarene 
fund and we're doing these kind of operations all   over the world today so how let's go back in 
time to before you worked as a security agent   for the homelands homeless or an agent for the 
homeland security investigations unit how did   you how were you trained to do that like what was 
your background before you became employed as an   agent and what was it about you that made you 
capable of engaging in this sort of operation   so I I I got a graduate degree in um International 
politics and I always wanted to be in federal law   enforcement my first job was CIA I was there 
doing 911 um working in the operations center   in the wake of 9 11. I found out that I studied 
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction uh that   was the the actually the degree I got at the 
Monterey Institute of international studies   um and so um it was an easy recruit into the 
CIA because you know 911 had just happened when   I found out that one of the terrorists Muhammad 
attah had staged his attack from Mexicali Mexico   across the border and I speak Spanish I wanted 
to go fight terrorism on the southern border so   I ended up jumping on the ship from CIA and 
I joined the newly created Homeland Security   Department and it became a special agent for six 
months I was tracking those kind of movements   uh you know not not human trafficking or child 
exploitation but money guns terrorism six months   into that Endeavor I was called into the office 
of a supervisor and they asked me if I would   please forgo everything that I wanted to do with 
my career and help them start a child crimes unit   I do not know why they asked me uh one thing he 
did say to me was you're a young agent but you're   a person of faith and we know that about you and

prayers and meditations I would like you if you   would to tell us to the degree that you can 
what you were typically dealing with when you   started when you started working for the child 
sex crimes unit let us know what you saw let us   know what you what that did to you because that 
sort of thing that changes people's conceptions   of humanity per se let's say the nature of the 
cosmos and what it means to be human right I mean   when you're when you're in contact with people 
who are capable of that level of Darkness you   start to understand something about the nature 
of the human soul that you can't understand any   other way and that can be a I mean that's the 
sort of thing that gives people post traumatic   stress disorder when they're soldiers so and and 
now you said also your supervisors had an inkling   that you might be protected against that at least 
to some degree because of your faith so let's walk   through what you learned and encountered first 
what what did you see when you were working as   part of this child sex crimes unit what I saw was 
so shocking Jordan uh I thought child sex crimes   would be 15 year olds 16 year olds uh my brain 
couldn't comprehend something more evil than   abusing that age the very first case I worked in 
2002 I believe I was given a bunch of VHS videos   some hard drives to look at that had been seized 
in a warrant the very first image I saw um were um there were three uh three little boys ah 
that were probably seven five and three   and they looked uh like they looked like my 
children they had you know they had blonde   blonde eye blonde hair blue eyes and they 
were being just raped raped these three   little boys by this pedophile and I was 
so shocked I fell to my knees I dry heaved   thinking I was going to throw up into the 
waste basket I jumped into my car I drove   to my children's School my three oldest kids I 
checked them out I still remember in my mind I   can still see dentist dentist appointment I wrote 
and I grabbed them I took them home and just   sobbed on the floor my wife came in and I just I 
wouldn't let the kids go just holding them shaking   um that was my very first experience uh you talked 
about PTSD I absolutely deal with PTSD to this day   um I I took too long to actually deal with it 
uh that's another story um and I thought I can't   I can't do this I can't do this um I started 
getting help immediately uh because I didn't   want to quit and uh that that's that's what this 
is that's what this is and those kind of videos   have increased over the last couple years by 
five thousand percent yeah well in in Canada   um we just had a report from an organization 
called the Western Standard that one million child   sexual exploitation photos and videos have been 
identified in an Alberta child porn investigation   one million photos eight arrests made okay so 
that's some indication of the widespread nature   of the problem now you said that when you first 
encountered this material it made you physically   ill and also terrified for the safety of your 
children but then also it necessitated you seeking   um health I suppose or Aid I mean I've worked 
with people who've had post-traumatic stress   disorder generally what happens is that tragedy is 
not enough to give someone post-traumatic stress   disorder even if it's rather severe it has to be 
a combination of tragedy and malevolence and the   real trauma comes as a consequence of contact 
with evil with malevolence and what people   generally have to do in order to recover 
from that is to develop a rather profound   philosophy of evil and you know a religious 
faith in in its most fundamental Essence is a   philosophy of Good and Evil it it does detail 
out the Heart of Darkness among human beings   point out to people this is particularly although 
you not not uniquely true of the Christian   tradition but particularly true that that capacity 
for evil lurks in the heart of everyone and that   are fundamental moral obligation as we Soldier 
and here on Earth is to overcome that proclivity   within and also to stand up against it in the 
external world and so you said you received   some Aid after you had been exposed to this first 
set of videos um what what is it about the way you   looked at the world that had to change in order 
for you to adapt to what you were encountering   well I had to come to grips with the the an idea 
that I had never been confronted with before that   there are people and not a few but millions 
of people only millions of of pedophiles could   justify a demand of millions of child exploitation 
uh material videos and so forth uh the first   person you see arrested in the movie is a real 
person named ursulchinski in sound of Freedom he   had over 2 million pieces of child rape material 
in his house so um to to be confronted with the   reality that there are people on this planet and 
like like I said not a few but but Millions who   want to indulge in watching five-year-old children 
be raped and sexually assaulted in ways that and   I'm sorry to be so raw but I feel comfortable 
with you Dr Peterson but uh to to to watch   children's bodies actually break in the act 
of sexual assault acts that your mind couldn't   conjure up if you tried to conjure it up and 
that it's real that is so shocking to the system   um it changes your life forever I I tell 
people if I feel like I've had a million   holes burned into my brain because I've watched 
thousands of hours of that kind of material not   only not only watch it and I love the scene 
that Jim depicts where he's it's that's very   real I I break I can't watch I can't watch 
the movie but the movie's very good the   movie doesn't show any of this by the way it 
doesn't show anything like this I don't want   people to run away and be scared but you 
see the scene where the the camera flashes   um a close-up into Jim's eyes and that's that was 
me for for 10 years not only watching but writing   writing it in details for the court to see for 
the prosecutors to see and and raising children   at the same time that are the very same age and 
fortunately or unfortunately for me I have now I   have nine children that at the time I I left the 
government at six and so I can always identify   the age of a child with one of my own children 
and my mind was almost automatically doing is   I would superimpose my own children's faces and 
persons onto these children and that's that led to   um that led to the PTSD I'll be honest um and 
almost a paranoia about what would happen to my   children and watching my children and I've come a 
long ways and and I'm I'm able to deal with it but   I I I I was determined never to quit and so I just 
sought more help and I I won't quit so okay so Tim   I'm I'm gonna walk you through what I know about 
how people turn into the sort of pedophile that   you find so you and everyone else I suppose 
or virtually everyone else finds so mysterious   so I'm going to refer first to the story of Cain 
and Abel because it actually puts its finger on   the process in a stunning manner so what happens 
in that story is that two different Pathways to   adaptation are detailed out and they become the 
Cardinal Pathways of adaptation that characterize   the whole human race immersed as it is from that 
point onward in history instead of in the Garden   of Eden and one is the pathway of Cain and the 
other is the pathway of Abel now Abel makes high   quality sacrifices he's all in right he puts 
himself on the line and he does the real thing   and as a consequence God finds God uh finds 
he finds favor with God and His sacrifices   are rewarded he does well and everyone loves 
him and he thrives and Cain his sacrifices are   not of the same quality he tries to cut the 
corners and to and to pull the wool over his   eyes and and God's eyes and everyone else's eyes 
and as a consequence his sacrifices are rejected   and instead of clueing the hell in and waking 
up and taking responsibility for his failure   he decides that he's going to call out God for 
creating a cosmos that's cosmically unfair and   unjust and the evidence for that is Kane's 
failure and Abel's success and so he has a   little chat with God and he basically calls 
him out and says you know I'm breaking myself   in half here and nothing's going my way and 
Abel gets everything he wants and you know   how dare you make a cosmos so radically unjust 
and improper and why don't you just straighten   yourself out and God says if you did well 
you would be rewarded for it and you should   look to yourself and then he says something 
even worse and this is very subtle because   um it's complicated to understand it unless you 
look at multiple translations or potentially the   original Hebrew which I can't read but I read 
the multiple translations God says to Cain   the spirit of sin crouches at your doorstep 
like a sexually aroused predatory animal   and you have invited it in to have its way with 
you and so now if you study the development of the   fantasies of very very dark people you see that 
they brewed and fantasize in isolation for years   and the fantasies get darker and darker and darker 
so they're bitter and resentful to begin with   and then they start fantasizing about well 
what they would want that can take a sexual   end or it can take a very violent and or it can 
take both and what they're really after is the   ultimate in Revenge and on the sexual front they 
find a kick in extending the what would you call   it unacceptability of the fantasy one stage at a 
time um the the famous and extremely attractive   sexual serial killer what was his name he's 
a famous photograph of him like this very   attractive man do you remember his dad Bundy 
Ted Bundy Ted Bundy detailed out exactly how   his fantasies progressed as he became more and 
more involved with pornography and what happens   in some sense is that these people who are nursing 
these terrible fantasies want to stay on the edge   of novelty and so their fantasies get darker and 
darker and darker as they progress down that road   and so after a thousand such micro progressions 
they end up in exactly the sort of pit that   you're describing and some of that is pure sexual 
kick because of the novelty and but it's got this   sadistic and perverse uh vengeful twist and you 
could think about it this way you know I think   it says in the gospels that you know it would be 
better that that a most Millstone was hung around   your neck and that you were cast into the abyss 
than to do harm to any of God God's children let's   say and the that's actually where the perverse 
Delight comes because the most egregious possible   sin let's say is the violent sexual abuse of the 
most innocent possible person and the perverse   novelty kick is highest at exactly that point and 
then that just goes from bad to worse and there's   a thousand or even ten thousand micro decisions 
that go along with that there's also a great book   called Ordinary men this is well worth reading 
although it's a bloody catastrophe to read I'll   tell you it details out how a group of German 
policemen who were moved to Poland during World   War II were transformed from ordinary middle class 
working class or sorry ordinary working class men   um old enough to not have been raised under the 
Nazi regime by the way and so not propagandized   into a kind of mindless obedience how they went 
from being perfectly ordinary policemen to the   sort of people who could take naked pregnant women 
out into the middle of the field and shoot them in   the back of the head and it isn't like they had 
an easy time with that some of them reported the   same sort of thing that you reported when you 
first watched that video they would they what   they were being called upon to do stage by stage 
made them physically ill and they had a commander   who actually had told them that they could leave 
the service if they didn't want to continue with   their duties but they felt Duty bound not to lead 
leave their comrades having to mop up the terrible   situation but it does a lovely job of detailing 
out how your movement from normality to Absolute   perversity is a consequence of ten thousand micro 
um what would you say micro violations of your own   conscience not all of the micro obviously so you 
know you need to know about the vengefulness you   need to know about the kick of sadism that's that 
novelty kick that produces a dopaminergic kick   that heightens sexual satisfaction and so there's 
an there's an element of sadistic misery that can   add novelty to sex that's particularly attractive 
to people who are bitter and resentful because   they actually can't find any willing sexual 
partners and so they're angry at the world   and shake their fist to God because of it and so 
anyways that's a bit of the developmental course   of such of such a lovely descent into hell and and 
the interesting thing about it is that people Brew   Day like you don't get to the point where you're 
watching pornographic videos of children being   raped without hundreds or even thousands of hours 
of increasingly demented voluntary fantasy and   that's that allowing the spirit of sin that would 
otherwise crouch on your doorstep to enter your   house and have its way with you right it's like 
a collaborative Venture with Satan himself that's   the most straightforward way of describing it and 
so well so that's I don't know what you have to   say about that but I'll let you have at her I'll 
say this that everything you're saying absolutely   he resonates with my anecdotal experiences dealing 
with these people I look into their eyes and what   you're describing is what I see though I've never 
been able to articulate it like you just have   so I appreciate being armed with with um with an 
understanding that it will help me uh evangelize   more clearly to others about the dangers of 
of over stimulation and overview support of   pornography and and shaking hands with the devil 
so thank you for that that was very insightful   so I I spent a bit of time um not a lot but 
a bit of time inside a maxim security prison   when I was a kid I worked with a very strange 
psychologist that was there and one of the   things that really shocked me and I I think this 
shocked me enough to change my whole life was   I I met these I met this one prisoner who was a 
pretty non-descript looking character he took me   for a walk out in the yard away from a gym full 
of like weight lifting Ax Murderer monsters and   rapists and we went for a walk out in the yard 
and the psychologist called us back and told me   later in the office that this guy who's about 
five two pretty non-pre-possessing guy had uh   made two policemen Neil in front of him begged 
for their lives in reference to their families   and then shot them both in the back of the head 
and and kicked them aside and the shocking thing   to me was you know you kind of think that if you 
met pure evil it would it would have a monstrous   form and you know the thing that shocked me about 
that was the non-descript nature of this guy you   know his his absolutely banal ordinariness 
the fact that you could just walk past him   on the street you'd never know he wasn't some 
monster you know the Monstrous character of   Satan in your imagination is you know a figure 
that's terrifying to behold instead of someone   normal you know what I mean normally in that 
cringing sense these people that you've interacted   with like what's your what's your reaction to them 
when you talk to them the pedophiles when you talk   to them and when you arrest them my experience 
is very similar to what you just described very   nondescript people of all walks of life we've 
we've we've arrested and I've interrogated   um Educators uh lawyers law enforcement clergyman 
um and and uh sitting across from them there's but   with no apparent physicality that would tell you 
who they are but I will say this when they start   talking and I look into their eyes that's when 
I can I sense something that that really scares   the hell out of me um and the way they talk 
about children when they get there and it's   it's something that they've been able to normalize 
and they're speaking to me about children almost   like they're talking about you know the weather or 
you know talking about buying and selling children   like you talk about buying and selling computer 
parts or an automobile or something and that's   where I thought you something has taken over 
you something non-human has made you less human   um and I've never been able to figure it 
out uh only that it creeps me out and and   um and I usually end up getting them to confess 
because they have brought themselves to a place   where they think they're okay they think that 
it's somehow normal I don't know if that makes   sense how do they do Dr Peterson well well the 
the degree of rationalization that has to with   each with each step forward in the progress of 
the fantasy there has to be a step forward in the   self-deception with regards to self-description 
right so imagine that you're you're attempting to   cling to a sense of yourself at least as normal 
but even maybe as a moral agent I mean the the   more forthright pedophiles claim that they're 
only allowing children to express their true   sexual desires and that what they're actually 
doing is forming the best relationship with the   children that they've ever had now of course 
there's part of them that knows that that's   an absolutely bloody screaming hellish lie but 
you get to that lie like I said with a thousand   micro lies right and you're modifying your 
self-conception along the way I mean have you   had these people justify themselves to you and 
if so by what means do they attempt to do that   so one person that comes to mind absolutely the 
answer is yes and one person that comes to mind is   the person depicted in the film oshensky uh this 
person had written uh articles self-published of   course he had a book that he actually sold 
on Amazon and his understanding or his his   justification was that the puritanical Society 
of this country has crushed the true uh and and   and beautiful and righteous uh sexual experience 
uh which the most natural would be between a man   and a child a prepubescent child a prepubescent 
child is is is the is the most beautiful form of   humanity and um and why why take that away from a 
child's children would be well uh conditioned to   to to confront the challenges of life if only they 
could experience orgasmic pleasure even in their   prepubescence um this is how they talk right right 
and right yeah well that you saw because of that   there was attempts made in the 1970s by French 
intellectuals surprise surprise to have the age of   consent reduce radically and that was always the 
rationale it was an extension of the patriarchal   oppression theory in some sense right that all 
sexual expression is essentially pure and good   in its most fundamental form and it's all warped 
by social pressure and if we were just allowed to   express ourselves in every manner that we saw fit 
that everyone would be free and we wouldn't suffer   any more from the constraints of of tyrannical 
Society right and it's just convenient for the   bloody pedophiles that that happens to justify 
them doing whatever they the hell they want to   children who are obviously too young to consent 
right so he is a good example I forgot about that   in the book Jim let me ask you so now you didn't 
have to go through the same things that Tim did   and you obviously weren't subject to the same 
kind of exposure but you had to play this role   and you had to act out in your imagination 
the darkness that characterized the people   who played your enemies let's say on the screen 
what were the consequences for you of having to   delve even on the fictional landscape into this 
entire uh what would you say underworld domain   well let's um start with your story 
initially when you brought up Cain and Abel   um in my years of working with agents like 
Tim and I actually worked with other agents   because Tim was very busy doing Missions at the 
time and I got to go in to a lot of his world I   mean those are the guys that I play so I don't 
imitate other actors I go and meet these guys   and really learn and study what they do Cain 
and Abel for example able is doing good things   for God how would Cain hurt God by killing Abel 
by wounding him when I go and play for example   a serial killer or a man that you mentioned 
earlier Ted Bundy who my friend uh broke that   case and found out who he was Mike tando so 
you're the Beast that comes in you he he he   um comes in and he um deceives you and and 
starts with the ego and the whole thing   and then eventually the turn is is how that you're 
eventually not fair on non-servient uh becomes   um one who how can I wound God the most by killing 
the most innocent child and it wounds God in the   greatest way when you take these innocent children 
who've done nothing and have no sin and these guys   um uh um have the attitude which you were 
mentioning earlier all the cutting of the corners   and whatnot and ultimately they um can kill the 
most innocent and effectively wounds God's heart   the most um I spent a great deal time I did this 
movie uh Deja Vu and I played it uh Unabomber and   I was on the phone with um um a friend a friend 
of mine who broke the case and uh on Ted Bundy   and I talked to him a lot about uh serial killers 
and then um I got to look at the um with the FBI   and the ATF gave me uh through Jerry Bruckheimer 
and Tony Scott I got all these videos to look at   and the the um we I was looking at unabomers 
uh guys that um blow things up and um an actual   serial killers but it was written more like a Ted 
Bundy um and not a a man who is writing Destiny   and all of these things that he'd exchanged his 
life to take out um whoever they want to take   out and but the the but the voice was very 
similar and so I don't go to Satan to play in this particular um Story I played this this 
guy this um bomber and I don't go to the devil   to play the devil I think make many actors 
make that mistake go to God to tell you who   the devil is that's what I do and it also gives 
me a protection what's the difference what's the   difference Jim like because that also Bears 
on how you protect yourself from such things   um the difference and are you saying um the 
difference in the the difference is is that I   play the truth so if you go and play go to the 
devil to play the devil the devil will deceive   you and put something up there that uh deceives 
the public he'll always try to hide in the shadow   he'll always try because he doesn't like the light 
even though he's called the light the Illuminator   um the Lucifer um and he tries to mimic God 
he tries to be like God so there's always like   um if God has love and what we see is 
love he creates lust he's always trying   to be like that it's like uh Kane trying 
to rip off Abel cutting the corners and   um so committing to well there's a tendency even 
in Milton's uh in in in Milton's Paradise Lost   there's been two readings of that forever and 
one of them is that Milton's Satan is um an   anti-hero of the most profound sort really the 
embodiment of evil and the other reading is that   um Milton Satan is a a disguised hero and 
the Eternal what would you say the Eternal   rebel against established order and someone to 
emulate in consequence and that Milton somehow   knew that and was coding that not precisely 
secretly but subtly and I think that's a huge   mistake I mean I've familiarized myself with 
Paradise Lost and I think that Milton was an   extraordinarily subtle writer in that he got 
everything as right as anyone ever has but the   reason I'm bringing that up is because so this is 
okay this is a complicated thing to untangle but   one of the things you see in Hollywood portrayals 
of villains you saw this in the Silence of the   Lambs you see it frequently in Mafia portrayals 
is that the villain is inadvertently or even   sometimes purposefully glorified and it's 
partly because he's a rule breaker and and   has the attraction that goes along with that 
but I also wonder too if it's it has something   to do with what you were describing is that 
the writers and the actors find themselves   when they're trying to portray evil pulled 
towards falseness in that representation as part   of the proclivity of evil to hide itself and the 
danger in that is twofold and one is the danger   of deceiving the public as to the true nature of 
evil because there's nothing heroic about it quite   the contrary and the second danger I wonder 
about you know there's all this speculation   about Heath Ledger and the consequences that 
for him of having played the Joker in such a   dark Manner and you know I don't know what to make 
of that although I do think there is some danger   in having to Journey down a path of emulating 
evil in order to represent it now you said that   you turned to God so to speak to protect yourself 
against false representations of evil but also in   some ways to Shield yourself and it sounds to me 
reminiscent of what Tim's uh superiors mentioned   to him when they said to him that his faith 
might protect him from this question what was   okay go ahead man this is the best 
interview I've ever had in my life I   love your line of questioning and um 
getting to what what is real my job   uh is to give what I know to be absolutely certain 
and real I hooked into Tim has a childlike quality   to him and I stay with that innocence and that and 
don't take that innocence's weakness or uh and uh   so when I read the scripture I I feel 
truth good evil and I find the good   and let that just pierce the darkness and it has 
to pierce and I know what that light is and I know   that deception that when I start hearing about 
for example in your life when you there's two   masters here one is from the evil Wicked side 
but he comes in through your ego and the other   one is the light side that tells you might what 
you might not want to hear but you ought to hear   and it's not manipulative it's truth so I I go to 
that side then I pray then I go through it like   The Passion of the Christ I looked at the Shroud 
of Turin and there were two men Christian Tinsley   and Keith vanderlin who are experts in makeup and 
the first both of these men were agnostic and they   looked at the Shroud that Mel Gibson presented 
to them and one particular way the way it is   uh through the negative however they were able to 
show it you can see the track lines of Jesus you   can see the the the actual um bamboo sticks that 
they used to to initially hit him and then you   see the cat of nine tails the track lines they 
look like the Grand Canyon in your skin and it   shocked them now these guys look at everything 
from decapitations murders and everything   prior to this I did a movie a long time ago in New 
York and I was with homicide and I got to see the   contortion of a face when someone gets murdered 
and it's hard to watch but when you start going   into this which is children there is something 
that I can't even fathom even with the protection   of almighty God because it took me two years 
to get over this two years in the a friend of   mine Debbie came into the room and at around three 
o'clock in the middle of the night she I was in a   chair and she heard me just weeping now I would go 
into these black holes and I have no idea I don't   remember it but this was all of the screaming 
that I had to hear I didn't want to hear it but   I had to hear it and then I was able to transform 
that into the movie that you just saw when I took   asked Alejandro monteverdi to move to our DP to 
take it and show him my eyeball so you would see   a 20-foot eye to see what Tim goes through to rip 
his heart out now it's not like uh this is what I   want to experience any more than I want to get on 
a cross and have uh my heart broken I went through   hypothermia I had to have open heart surgery I was 
electrocuted struck by lightning I understand the   the the necessity of what I was going to have 
to go through could help bring people back to   God to wake them up and quite frankly more people 
now Jordan are more afraid of the devil than they   are of God because they want a happy Jesus and 
the problem is is that eventually Jordan we all   are going to die eventually that that is going 
to happen but people the the power of the devil   deceives to say no no you're going to be around 
for a long long time and and they never wake up   and eventually there's a judgment and then you 
have to decide or God decides not how you want   to see yourself anymore but how God sees you and 
how God sees you is who you really are and so   that's how I I chose to to go at this particular 
case I had no choice but to go in and I hear the   screams in my heart I hear the screams because of 
the agents that I got to work with got to show me   things and they one particular time he says are 
you sure you want to go further but I was weeping   so hard I said this is what Tim goes through this 
is what I got I got to see it in order to go into   there there to to take people to a level of will 
you do something will you do something at some   point it ends for all of us and so the pain in my 
heart is much better than the pain in the future   and if I have to see that to save my children to 
motivate me to save my niece to tell my sister no   walking home at 13 years old from school is not a 
good choice not a good choice my sister says to me   no I want my sister my daughter excuse me to have 
the same kind of experience I have and I said no   not until this changes you need to understand 
so and my sister is a good great mother but she   wasn't aware because the media that's supposed 
to do a good job to tell the truth well they're   going into that direction which is let's kind of 
twist it and change it and not talk about it or   the three letter agencies that aren't telling the 
truth go ahead Jordan how has this changed you how   is how is experiencing that material and having 
to play it out changed you I I I'd give my life   and a heartbeat changed me I'm less concerned 
about myself than I am about hurting I I will tell   you this right now I would absolutely die if this 
If This Were to change the world and get rid of   trafficking and pornography and all of the eight 
arms of this octopus that has to be destroyed the   only way you can destroy is take the head out if 
that hit I'd give my life for it in a heartbeat   Tim let me ask you a question Jim referred to 
this is an awkward question I don't know how to   progress with it exactly right but he said that he 
tried to play you with a certain kind of innocence   and you know there's a gospel line and the line 
is unless you become as a little child you will   in no way enter the kingdom of heaven and it's 
a very very subtle line because it doesn't say   unless you stay as a child right it says unless 
you become as a child and and that's a very   it's a very paradoxical injunction and 
it means something like this it means   if you ReDiscover the innocence and 
humility and capacity for play and wonder   and open ended trust that you had as a child but 
you still have all the wisdom that you have as an   adult after having seen the world then you have 
entered into you might say a new domain and a   more elevated form of being and Jim said that he 
was struck when talking to you about uh it with   regard to this childlike innocence that he saw 
on you which is very peculiar thing to observe   in someone who's had to expose himself to all the 
terrible things that you've encountered and so   I don't I don't have a more fully developed 
question than that I I guess I just like   your response to that set of observations I do 
think I think I know what Jim's talking about um when we're doing operations as you see depicted in 
sound of Freedom it's some crazy stuff we're going   into crazy places we're talking to uh monsters 
and demons and if I were to apply all the things   I I know the things that take me down the images 
of children um I could be jaded and and less less   innocent um I think this might go back to the the 
the the the the boss who asked me to start this   work back in 2002 by saying that we think you can 
handle this because of your faith so when I I do   try to be a child like childlike when it comes 
to my relationship with with God and there's a   scripture that I repeat in my head constantly as 
I am going into these dark places and that's where   I become like a child through that recitation and 
my relationship with God or even more particularly   with Jesus um because it's Jesus who says the line 
and you've already quoted it Jordan uh better than   a millstone be placed around your neck and you 
toss through the bottom of the seed and that you   should hurt one of these little ones um that's so 
powerful to me because it's it's so it it allows   me to read to read reduce everything to just an 
innocent I hope childlike relationship with With   My Savior with my god um because I know where he 
stands on this and I might not know everything   and I don't know how this is going to resolve in 
my head I don't know how I'm going to heal the   millions of of holes burned into my brain but I 
do know that if I subject myself completely to to   an understanding and a testimony that that Jesus 
believes something he gets mafioso this is cement   shoes kind of talk uh it's not it's not it's not 
flipping tables outside the temple I mean he's   talking about violence he's speaking violence 
but it's it's righteous and that's where he   stands on children being abused and that's where 
I find so there's a there's another idea there's   another idea that lurks in the passion account 
hey that that's really quite stunning and horrible   so the the passion story is an archetypal 
tragedy and the reason for that is that   a tragedy is when something terrible happens 
to someone but uh a more profound tragedy is   when the worst possible thing happens to the 
least deserving person and so that's the passion   story in some ways in a nutshell right you have 
a man who by Universal admission even on the part   of his enemies is at minimum a very good man who 
undergoes the worst possible sequence of betrayal   and Punishment and so that's the story of the 
tragedy of human life writ large but there's more   to it than that because there's a mythological 
insistence along with that that Christ was not   only crucified but that he had to descend into 
the depths of Hell itself and Harrow it and what   that means to me psychologically speaking let's 
say is that you're called upon before rebirth   that's a good way of thinking about it to not only 
bear the brunt of the tragedy of existence but   to face malevolence head on right to go into 
the deepest and darkest possible places and   what what do you say it's it's and and well 
redeeming them to the degree that that's possible   simultaneously redeem yourself and so the 
notion there is that the brightest possible   light is only possible through the descent into 
the darkest possible realm of of Blackness and   that actually goes beyond death into malevolence 
itself now Jim said you know because you might   say well there's nothing that you should be 
more afraid of than death but Jim said you   know he's appalled enough about the existence of 
malevolence that he would be willing to give his   life to eradicate it and so that obviously 
means that for Jim malevolence itself is a   more terrifying Specter than than mere death 
or even mere suffering and then there is this   gospel notion that unless you're willing to take 
the weight of Hell onto yourself essentially um   voluntarily that you can't go through that process 
of descent and rebirth and that is associated in   the in the gospel accounts let's say with that 
rebirth into the spirit of childhood and so   you you have done what you could to face 
the ultimate reaches of Darkness itself   what has that done for you and then also you 
made some very interesting comments about your   wife you know you said that in some ways you were 
hoping she would tell you to you know be sensible   and come home but she didn't she told you to 
go put yourself on the line and there's a huge   story there that's touched on in the movie but 
but not delved into in any to any great regard   um how has your encounter with the darkness that 
you've seen made you a better person and and what   has that done with your relationship with your 
wife I think it's it's made me a better person   because the the weight that you speak of 
that that is on your back is unbearable   unless you can give it to some other power in this 
case in my case to Jesus himself and that's what   to subject myself completely and repeat his words 
in my mind because I know where he stands on it   he'll take it from me and I felt that I have 
felt that in ways I can't even articulate that   don't make any sense on a scientific level I the 
burden is lifted and that's what gives me Clarity   and courage to do things I otherwise wouldn't 
dream of doing uh in order to help children and   it's it's a concept that my wife understands in 
fact I'll tell you this she it's like she morphed   into some kind of a therapist in that moment after 
she told me that her her salvation might be on the   line she's much more advanced than I am in every 
way and especially spiritually and she helped me   to see that uh very thing that give the burden 
to to God and and then you can be but you have   to subject yourself like a child in order to do 
that and recognize you can't on your own do it   but she she ran me through this exercise don't 
know where she got it maybe it was a download   from heaven but she said do you see the two paths 
you're going on either you're going to Colombia   and you do this operation and what does that look 
like and and I said it looks horrifying it's scary   it's dark because there's cobwebs I I mean I was 
literally imagining this there's there's spiders   there's evil things and she said what's the other 
path and I said well the other path is is light   um it's you know I I can see at 50 I get to 
retire and then I don't have to you know I I'm   I'm paid a federal government salary my whole 
life and benefits and that seems secure to me   and I that seems comfortable then she says close 
your eyes and and you're with your maker you've   passed through this life and you're talking to 
your maker and he has two questions for you one   could you have saved the kids and two did you 
do it that's your interview and she's and and   I got it shocked me I thought oh that's going to 
be a bad interview uh if I don't have the right   answer if I don't make the right decision here 
and then she says okay now go back to those two   paths what do you see and I'm telling you the the 
cobwebs and creepy things we're now on the path of   staying in my federal government comfortable job 
I thought what might I lose what blessings might   not come and then she said what do you see down 
the path of Colombia and she said I see I said I   see warmth I see I can't see everything but that's 
the path I want and I think that's what that means   is I will give it to God and do the right thing 
and subject myself like a child I hope that made   sense well well you know look the reason that 
people lie and the reason they remain silent   is because they think that things 
will be easier for them and better   at least in the short term but the psychological 
literature on this is pretty damn clear I think   I think clearer than any other element of The 
Clinical Psychology literature which is that   you avoid things that stand in your way 
that frighten you at your great peril   if you cower from them in silence or you turn away 
seeking Security even or even sensible security   you violate the principle of your own strength 
and if you violate the principle of your own   strength you become weak and if you're weak 
there is no security like if you're weak and   you have a pension you're weak with a pension all 
that'll mean is that you'll live longer in Terror   that's not helpful and the alternative and that 
there's also a an ethos in the biblical stories   in particular and it's a very interesting ethos 
it's very much worth knowing and one is that   if you say the truth and and nothing else you'll 
have a immense Adventure as a consequence you   won't know what's going to happen to you and 
you have to let go of your clinging to the   to the outcome you have to let go but the truth 
will reveal the world the way it's intended to   be revealed and the consequence for you will 
be that you'll have the adventure of your life   and the other part of that ethos is this and it 
makes perfect sense to me I I can't see how it   can be any other way which is that whatever makes 
itself manifest as a consequence of the truth is   the best possible reality that could be manifest 
even if you can't see it and you know in my own   life I've been attacked many times by people who 
were attempting to demolish my reputation and take   me out and that's put my family at risk and many 
times we've gone through this a lot and what we   have observed is that if we stick to our guns 
and we say what we believe to be the case and   I say we because it's a collaborative Enterprise 
I'm always discussing things with my family that   there's a period of intense discomfort and the but 
the the in the aftermath of that and that's often   several months or sometimes even several years 
later things switch around and reverse in in a   manner that brings benefits that can't even be 
fathomed so so and it is a matter of Faith right   so the faith is something like this look are 
you going to make your way through life with   silence and falsehoods are you going to make your 
life your way through life with truth and there's   going to be a price for the truth but your vision 
showed you there was a price for the security too   right once once you allowed your imagination 
to manifest itself you saw that the pathway of   security was actually the one that was covered 
with spider webs demons and snakes and you know   I see that I saw that with faculty members at 
the University over and over they would take   the so-called secure path forward and all they did 
was violate the Integrity of their own Souls right   all that security is false and obviously your 
wife for some reason it's quite the miraculous   part of that story I would say that your wife 
was behind you like that especially because you   said you had six kids at the time you know so how 
do you think she knew this you said her faith is   more developed than yours and and that she knows 
things you don't but what was it about her life   did you think that enabled her to stand behind you 
and this crazy Venture you went on when she had   every reason to make you mean you were the movie 
says you were within what months of vesting your   pension how many 12 weeks something like that I I 
don't I don't I can't remember the exact time but   yeah that was the my accountant came to me and 
showed me how much how many millions of dollars   this would amount to that I was walking away from 
it was ridiculous I want to say 12 million dollars   or something a number I couldn't even fathom but 
you're walking away from that and that really   tossed me and that's the thing that led me to 
mccatherine and said this is what we'd be walking   away from why does she have this thing um I it's 
a mystery to me I I can say this having having   given birth and raised six children I've watched 
that process it's there's something I think that   happens to to women at least in the case of 
my wife uh that um there's some insight that   comes from that process and and and childbirth 
and rearing a child that she's had to rely on   God just to get through that process and then 
have this little creature that you're in charge   of I I think her relationship with God allowed 
through motherhood allowed her to have insights   um that I didn't have I think she came with 
certain gifts as well that before this life   uh but whatever it was she saw immediately and 
and on the spot was able to run me through that   exercise that really is consistent with with your 
understanding of that process uh Dr Peterson so   um I don't know she's a miracle she's a 
miracle to me and none of this would have   happened without her well okay so you you quit 
your job and you put your pension on the line and   your wife was not only fully on board with that 
but perversely enough encouraged you to do so   how has it how has the financial support that 
made your continued existence and also the   operations that you've undertaken how has that 
manifested itself since like you you don't have   your pension and the government behind you but 
obviously you've gathered resources around you   personally and and practically 
how tell me how that came about   well I'll add this piece because I that was my big 
concern and Catherine said to me and she believed   it this is all in that same conversation she 
said I don't care if we end up living in a tent   we will not go back to our maker instead we 
didn't try to help these children so that's   so that helped ease my mind because I thought 
well then okay if we lose our house uh now   the the the blessings did come uh you know 
uh Glenn Beck was the person who actually   funded the rescue operation that you see 
depicted in the film that very first one   um he got our he got us started put a huge amount 
of faith and frankly risk in in in in doing that   um but that was going to get us only about six 
to eight months before we would be in trouble   but what happened was the success happened the 
peace that I felt in making the decision to go   was that New Path that I couldn't see everything 
but it felt right it felt good it felt Godly and   I knew it'd be okay and we've never had a worse 
month in the month before we've only grown with   success spread success donations start coming 
in Opportunities come in and frankly I think   I'll be better off financially uh as I look 
at my future than I would have been otherwise   right now you we we should just dwell on that 
for a minute so we just we just won't dwell on   how unlikely that is say so let's let's just go 
through this so you make this crazy decision to   quit your job and to forgo your your pension even 
though you've basically vested it and you're well   into your career you're to the point where in 
principle you could have contemplated retiring   and sitting to drink my Ties on the beach in 
the Caribbean which I wouldn't recommend by   the way as a as a retirement plan and instead you 
decide that and with your wife that you guys are   willing to you know risk living in a tent with 
your kids but you're going to do this come hell   or high water and the consequence of that is that 
perversely enough you're actually more financially   secure and you have more opportunities 
than you would have otherwise had by a lot   right so that's worth thinking about right 
that's really we're thinking about because   you threw yourself all in which is what you're 
supposed to do and not only did that work on the   fight side because you have been able to rescue 
these children and to continue this endeavor but   none of the things that you thought you 
would lose you actually ended up losing   that's correct and I and I I'm thinking of 
the words you just said five minutes ago about   when you take on the challenges you you lose that 
weakness that you otherwise would have I'd rather   I'd you know I I don't want to be weak with with a 
pension like you said I I was able to be stronger   and that strength is the thing that frankly 
allowed me to expand my uh possibility of making   more income and and doing more things in fact 
I often Journal um Jordan often when I have the   biggest challenges of my life that come and hit 
in the face with this or that I I take note what   blessings came what good things came and sometimes 
it's ninety percent of the good things before me   sprung out of that horrific challenge that the 
darts thrown at me whatever it was and so the   principle that you're teaching really has played 
out uh accurately in my life over and over again   yeah yeah yeah well I I think that's well it makes 
sense in some sense look I mean if we want to just   think about it practically I mean you're going to 
become stronger more confident more credible and a   better Communicator in precise proportion to the 
burdens that you decide voluntarily to confront   and master like obviously because how could it 
be any other way and then what that's going to   mean is that when you go communicate with people 
and you tell them what you're doing they're much   more likely to jump on board because you have the 
Charisma that goes along with having the stories   to tell and those encounters to to relate and the 
success you've generated and and so then people   are going to offer to help you're not even going 
to have to ask them and so let me let me ask you   about that you talked about Glenn Beck who else 
has been instrumental in helping your operation   grow and providing you with support you mentioned 
Tony Robbins as well and I've got to know Tony a   bit over the last last year or so I mean he's an 
absolutely remarkable person and I think he might   be the most charismatic person I've ever met which 
is really saying something because I've met some   very charismatic people and he's quite the monster 
in the world and he's done an awful lot of good   and and he's obviously supporting he's supporting 
you as well and is on board with this project and   so how did that come about well Tony Robbins is 
in fact uh the the single largest donor to to   our operation I'm super super close with him his 
his wife as well Sage Beautiful People beautiful   souls uh it came about in the most amazing way 
uh during one of his big Mastermind conferences   and a a Convention Center of some sort there was 
a woman who raised her hand when Tony asks about   bucket list uh projects if you had an excess of 
whatever what would you do with it she raised   her hand and said I'd support a group called 
operation Underground Railroad Tony says what   is that three minutes later he says I'll donate 
I'll match whatever someone gives me right now to   help rescue children and and and that's where 
the relationship was born he called me a few   days later and said is this real I said I felt it 
was I said why don't you come down to Haiti with   me we're about to do an operation and you can 
see how very real it is and he did and he saw   and that converted him to our cause so what's on 
your plate next what what where is this going as   far as you're concerned and what sort of impact 
what sort of impact have you had in sheer numbers   um why do you think you're not going to get 
taken out because it seems to me that you're in a   situation where that's you know of reasonable high 
probability given who you're dealing with and what   do you hope to accomplish over the next what do 
you hope to accomplish over the next while and and   what can people do to help well so I've changed 
quite a bit of how I look at the playing field of   human trafficking I can no longer do operations 
I've been in the media too much especially with   this film I've turned a lot of my attention to 
uh the fact that in what I call spiritual warfare   children are targeted like never before I was 
uh I was on the Capitol Hill last week and this   congressman is telling me how do we wake people 
up to the fact that all these unaccompanied minors   are being shoved into America and we don't know 
where they are and and I said well your problem   is you're not connecting all the dots all the ways 
in which children are being hurt not only these 85   000 missing children that are now on the belly of 
of the largest potentially child sex Market in the   world um but at the same time that's happening 
you have groups trying to get rid of the name   pedophile and call them minor attracted persons at 
the same time you're you're sexualizing children   giving them what I used to be able to arrest you 
for giving children now teachers in California   and other states are giving this in the name of 
of liberal liberating children's sexually or sex   education and now a 13 year old can consent to 
gender mutilation and inject them have themselves   injected with all sorts of chemicals that might 
ruin their reproductive system well what are you   doing consent to do that equals consent eventually 
to to sex with a 50 year old pedophile and so if   you you got to connect all these things and so I 
I for the first time in my life Jordan I'm looking   at the United States of America and I'm saying 
I'm saying look I used to think I might be out   of a job because we eradicated human trafficking 
I am now thinking I might be out of a job because   the very laws that protect children and allow us 
to go after their captors are being and will be   decaying and eroded with this crazy culture that 
is taking children in the name of liberating them   and in fact is enslaving them so you know I 
I interviewed this girl Chloe Cole who had   a double mastectomy when she was 15 and who had 
puberty blockers and went through the whole bloody   gamut of incompetent lying therapists and sadistic 
butchering surgeons and they transformed her   sexually and then she talked to me about her 
dating experiences in high school now you can   just imagine this you know it's complicated 
enough for a young man or a young woman in   high school to navigate the sexual Shoals let's 
say and establish a reasonable relationship or   even a reasonable sequence of relationships 
if everything is roughly normal or something   approximating ideal but Chloe put herself way 
out on the fringes having done what she did   and that made that took her out of the dating 
pool in high school for her compatriots and so   she turned to online dating and you can imagine 
the sort of people who attempted to pick her up   and she didn't refer to that an awful lot in our 
interview but she referred to it enough so that   I got a real flavor of the sort of people who uh 
were more than perversely willing to strike up a   relationship with her often much older as you 
pointed out and so you know that that freedom   that she was hypothetically offered that only 
required the sacrifice of her breasts let's say   uh the wounds of which by the way have never 
completely healed so that's perfectly goddamn   delightful and you know she talked about 
her dissent into that perverse underworld   of of deviant sexual attraction and so uh yeah 
there's not a lot of freedom on that front Jim   um what are you up to next like you finished 
this movie it's going to open up on July 4th   um what what's what's next for you on the project 
front and and also on the personal front in terms   of of your commitment to continuing the 
work that you're starting with this movie   well it goes to the next chapter um which 
is on Haiti and that's the next part of Tim   um when they went down and did this Haiti 
Mission and this is a much better script   than the first one written by the same director 
uh and Rod Barr Alejandro monteverdi wrote this   so I plan to do that film and um and then of 
course I'm doing the resurrection of the Christ   with Mel Gibson so I think that's going to be 
I think for sure it's one film but it might be   two films I think and when when so and what 
do you see what do you foresee happening on   the uh on the theatrical release front I mean 
I have the have the typical companies that are   involved in theatrical release in movies being 
on board with the release of sound of Freedom   or have have you run into like enthusiastic 
reception or resistance what's happened on that   front well we had a lot of resistance it took 
us four years to get where we're at right now   um you know like The Passion of the Christ nobody 
saw that as a of a financially feasible film same   thing with this who's going to want to watch 
a film about traffic children that's why it   wasn't about that it was it it points in that 
direction but it's really in the face of evil   can good still Triumph and that's what this film 
is so it's quite inspirational you know well it   is a classic in many ways it is a classic action 
adventure film I mean it's based on a true story   but it's got a very solid narrative driving line 
I mean it's not fundamentally making its Appeal   on the moral side I mean there is an appeal on 
the moral side don't get me wrong but that's   not good enough for a movie like a movie has to 
carry its own weight as an artistic Endeavor and   it has to be well plotted and well well acted 
and or just degenerates into kind of moralistic   propaganda I don't think this movie does that 
at all I also didn't think that the chosen did   that angel Studios other major production it never 
degenerated into sentimental moralizing thank God   and give that but something like that'll just flop 
at the box office anyways and I certainly couldn't   see any reason after having watched this movie not 
to think that this could be a commercial success   I mean it's a very exciting movie we're selling 
out right now where our biggest War right now   is to get more theaters the big studios control 
those and the Distributors have to decide whether   or not and this happened on The Passion of the 
Christ whether to go and go where the people are   um and so the people are calling in right now 
to you know ask for these theaters they're not   just going to angel.com I've known many people 
that have gone in and literally bought out all   theaters uh to do this and so we're hoping that 
this continues because we won't be able to serve   the public we just don't have enough theaters 
right now well that's that's a good problem to   have I would say and that should get also get you 
the kind of publicity that should also further   distribution of the film and of course there's 
alternative routes now too I mean Matt Walsh had   tremendous success Distributing what is a woman 
on Twitter I think they got 170 million views   and you know I don't know how successful that 
was commercially and of course that's a problem   because Financial issues matter but there's 
definitely multiple venues now where a film   like this can be can be distributed and of course 
Angel Studios had a hell of a success Distributing   what they produced on the on the chosen 
front using rather unorthodox channels online   and we're fortunate enough uh Jordan to get 
Elon Musk he he actually tweeted out a couple   weeks ago with the trailer and opened up Twitter 
as a free home for distribution um uh and that   and they're gonna you're gonna we're gonna see a 
Twitter release uh I think mid-july so that that   will be fun to see what happens there oh so that's 
already in play all right well all right well look   gentlemen we're running out of time on the YouTube 
front um as everybody watching and listening or at   least to some people watching and listening no I 
do add another half an hour of interview on The   Daily wire plus side and so I think we'll turn 
our attention to that I'm gonna find out from   from Tim and Jim what developmental route they 
took to the destination that they arrived at   um I haven't done that with two people before but 
I think that will be quite entertaining and so   um I'm interested in how people's Destinies make 
themselves manifest across time or you might say   how they're calling uh makes itself uh makes its 
appearance in their life because things do call to   people you know everybody has problems that beset 
them that are their problems and everybody has   opportunities that back into them that are their 
opportunities and that's kind of a mysterious   what would you say Bargain and interplay 
between the psyche and the world and uh I'm   endlessly curious about how that happens and 
so we're going to follow down that road as we   continue this conversation 
on the daily word plus side   um by the way for those of you who are watching 
and listening if you're thinking about uh throwing   some support the daily wire plus way is probably 
a good time to think about doing that because uh   they and I for that matter have been under a 
fair bit of pressure from YouTube in the last   month I've had three of my interviews taken 
down and I suspect there's a couple on the in   the pipelines that are also going to raise the 
hackles of the wrong people whoever the hell   they are lurking behind the scenes and so uh 
yeah yeah well you never know right you can't   tell what rules you broke and you can't tell 
who's enforcing the censorship rules um which   is real really not good on any front so anyways 
we're going to turn our attention over there   um thank you to Jim Caviezel and Tim Bellard 
for talking today uh I really enjoyed your film   I'm I'm looking forward to watching how the public 
will receive it and and what the consequences will   be and wish you both luck in your future endeavors 
and uh and yeah and Tim Mouse I will hook up hook   you up your wife up with my wife and it'd be real 
interesting to have them talk about you know how   she saw what you were doing and and why she threw 
her weight behind it because there's quite a story   there as well as far as I can tell I'm very 
much looking forward to watching that interview   all right gentlemen it was good to talk 
to both of you and uh thank you everyone   watching and listening thanks for your 
time and attention pay some attention   to this movie if you're inclined you 
bet guys you bet good to meet you both [Music]
