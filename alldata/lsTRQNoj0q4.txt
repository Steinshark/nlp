so I actually asked David what should I do when things get tough haha this is a good fuckin question manikin is going to get fucking difficult day after day after day that's the thing about what you're doing right now that's that's challenging is a lot of the motherfuckers can sign up for the fucking one-day event why don't we do a lot of these CEOs a lot of these people don't want to suffer you know as a living who don't want to suffer as making it a habit what they do is they go out and they recruit these people to put them through a two day three day fucking challenge anybody can do that shit because your mind can process two or three fucking days of suck what you're doing my friend is going to be damn near a month of suck so basically you're gonna have a lot of days especially in the morning time the mornings when you wake up and your body says go fuck yourself because I don't fucking like doing this today and you're gonna look at cuz you're running six miles a day I believe what you know what's going to happen to your fucking ass you're gonna wake up in the morning and you're gonna fucking do what I do people think all David goggies just wakes the fuck up and he just gets just shit on he gets this fuck am I gonna I don't get up and get after it I look at my shoes sometimes for hours I pass them I go I get stuff to drink I go to the bathroom I watch TV I'll start doing some work and I look at those fucking shoes because why my body's saying go fuck yourself so you have to be able to win the morning you have to be able to not allow that to get too deep in your brain and when things get really tough for you when you're out there on like day 17 and your knees are hurting and your back is hurt and your shoulders are hurting your elbow get elbow tendonitis and all kind of shit going on you got to start remembering your resume a lot of people don't remember what the fuck they've accomplished in life and at that time of suffering you have to be able to fucking go through and pull up that fucking who the fuck I am resume and say Oh for you you I'm sure you studied your fucking ass off for hours and days and years to give her your ass I guarantee you did shit harder than this and that's basically what you have to go back to but it's hard to do because in that moment of suffering all you can fucking think about is getting the fuck out of it so you got take that one second to pull yourself out of that suffering to have a clear fucking thought it's hard to have clear thoughts in the midst of extreme pain and suffering find that clear thought remind yourself of what you've been through back in the past back in the day to get to where you're at today so that's what I do it's a constant reminder and then through that process I guarantee you your mind and body muster up we got this we we've been here before maybe not that kind of pain and suffering but we've been here before in the demons of your own mind so that's the best reminder in the world you
