so hello everybody I am here with Owen Cyclops Owen Cyclops is an artist who does illustrations that use a lot of symbolism a lot of Christian symbolism a lot of weird symbolism and I encountered him on Twitter and I was so impressed by his work that I decided to Commission him an image based on the watch the fools theme in my videos the notion that the fool is also there to flip things when things are chaotic to bring the King back but they have to bring order back when the world is upside down and so we just finished this image last week I put it on some merch and I'm putting it out there as this video is playing and so I'm really excited to talk to Owen to figure out about his own journey through art through symbolism also through religious ideas and and get a sense how we connect [Music] this is Jonathan pezzo welcome to the symbolic world and so Owen maybe you can give us a bit of a sense of your journey about your work and kind of where you get your inspiration and where you feel like you're going right now yeah man yeah I'm really glad to be here well basically in a nutshell I guess you could say my kind of path my artistic path spiritual also because those are kind of the same thing for me actually would be that I was pretty much the I've always been into religion mysticism and things like that but I would describe myself previously as kind of like the caricature of white guy in his 20s really into like psychedelics and vaguely Eastern stuff and maybe seeing myself on kind of like a Foshan monocore like Western occult path so I really lived in that world for a really long time I was really into Buddhism Western occult and was kind of just floating for a really really long time and eventually I became Christian probably like two two-and-a-half years ago now and it's interesting it's kind of one of those things where like in in Buddhism actually there's a debate whether you get enlightened all at once or whether it's gradual so the joke is kind of that it's gradual until it's all at once and it's kind of how I feel looking back at my work in my path and stuff it's like it did happen kind of all at once one day but there also was a slow build-up where I was figuring things out so yeah basically now I view myself as I mean I I never really used this terms it sounds kind of pretentious I guess but kind of like a reformed occultist in her way I really do view myself as someone that was on like a particular path and then I got off of it and now I'm in Christendom and that's a huge part of my work is exploring that and bringing you know what I know and what I did into the light of that and also taking the light of that worldview and bringing it back to all the other things that I'm interested I guess the other piece of it not to go on too much with myself would be that part of that whole world is being into just kind of weird things in general whether it's like paranormal stuff maybe even touching on like construe see world or just kind of the whole strange set of odd things that happen in life so yeah now I am kind of going back and bringing the worldview I have now into that and things kind of make a lot more sense and then my art has always been married to that whole process yeah well it's interesting when you talk about the idea being a reformed occultist or something like that I I really have a theory about about that I know a lot of people that kind of came to Christianity and more traditional Christianity even let's say Eastern Orthodoxy or more traditional Catholicism who actually come out of an occult past you could say and my my theory about that is that the Christianity became so milquetoast you know in the the later centuries let's say towards around 17th 18th century you became very materialistic and Protestantism but also Counter Reformation was part of that that the the mystical aspect was almost forgotten it's as if it kind of faded away and or was left there that no one knew what to do with it and so it was taken up by all these these stranger parts and so the what I felt is that people who are looking at the occult usually their desire is not is not bad they want to find something deeper they want to get a deeper connection they want to understand you know how these patterns manifest themselves you know they can see that that's what some of these occult writers are talking about but sadly they end up with a kind of piecemeal solution you know the occultism is very fragmentary and it's very it lacks the full metaphysical structure that that traditional christianity offers and so i've noticed that a lot of those people when they come back then they see something like Eastern Orthodoxy they encounter you know the writing of the Church Fathers and how powerful it is and how you know the let's say the little things they got from magic in terms of understanding how ritualized reality is they notice that communion that you know the liturgical year the liturgical structure is you know it's whatever you learned about magic it's that times a thousand you know it's it's actually world building it actually it actually holds reality together and so it's just interesting to see that you have your kind on that a similar peso are you are you part of a group like are you in a particular church I am NOT actually it's not really it's actually not by design at all really I guess you could say is that when I first kind of got on board I decided that I should take some time and just kind of get my own life together and get my head straight and what I told myself was I was gonna focus kind of on my relationship with like God more than trying to pick like a particular group to be with I think also in the very beginning you know like I wouldn't say like I you hit rock bottom but like you hit the wall and you're like okay this is not the road to go down maybe the theological my new show doesn't matter like as much at that point but after a year maybe a little bit more than that I started to feel like I kind of had to figure it out a little bit so I've been doing my own like theological investigations and stuff like that I guess right now where I'm at is I'm more sympathetic to apostolic secession style Christianity that being like Catholicism and orthodoxy but I guess I'm kind of at this point where I can see where everyone's coming from and I do it goes back and forth between being like something that's on the front burner for me where I'm like all right I really gotta like figure this out but sometimes I feel like I'd like you don't know if you were born into orthodoxy or not but I feel like for me oh cool so yeah for me it goes back and forth between being like something that is genuinely coming from my like need for spiritual refuge but then also sometimes you know we were just talking about Twitter a minute ago it does become kind of like an ego aggrandizing exercise and when I get to that point I kind of put it on the back burner again when I'm like oh it's my job like I'm gonna come in and decide this like theological debate from centuries ago like me I'm so important so I go back and forth I'm figuring out slowly you could say yeah well I think there isn't there's a great value in kind of engaging I talk about this a lot in my on my channel it's hard to do because the world is so spectator like our whole world is very spectator like but there is a great value in participative patterns right where you actually engage inside the pattern that so going to a church part debating in the liturgy submitting to a priest like submitting to a spiritual father all of these these gestures make you participate in these these symbolic patterns that we notice in the world you know so I mean I would say I mean you'll figure it out on your own at some point you'll slowly kind of find your way hopefully into some community and so will trust God to kind of bring you towards the bring you towards whatever whatever ends up being the best for you in that moment yeah yeah I think it's happening slowly yeah I'm kind of in this weird Venn diagram overlap where like I don't belong to a group but I'm also not one of those people who's like yeah it doesn't matter it's all kind of the same anyway so right yeah I don't need to like clarify a little bit yeah so so the thing that really kind of attracted me to your art was of course it's very symbolic in the sense that it's very you use a lot of imagery that that is structured in a way that's very hieratic you know that it's very it's like almost like logo like it's not it doesn't take realism as its basis it doesn't take the the desire to show you know like the shadow of something the shadow of something on something else or the color but it's really typifies and so there's a kind of strange a very interesting mix of graphic art in your work iconography Christian iconography and almost a even a graffiti aesthetic you could say bringing it also into a knowledge of Western symbolism and of course also Western esoteric symbolism so that's kind of one of the questions that I had for you and it's funny because someone came at me on Twitter because of it because I was kind of I was promoting your work on Twitter and someone came at me and said oh he's using and he's using occult symbolism using esoteric symbolism and I think that I come at it also from a point of view the point of view that I mentioned before which is that I see a lot of the esoteric Christianity that appeared in the West as a desire to explore the deeper aspects of Christianity now they did it in a way that sometimes went totally off the rail that sometimes is unacceptable yes we can all acknowledge that for example like it you use some Rosicrucian symbolism one of your images and you had a rose in the center of the cross and someone was saying oh that's Rosie crucian but okay so it's Rosie crucian but are you looking at the symbol what's wrong with the idea that there's a rose at the center of the Cross it's actually a very powerful image of what the cross is what creation is what is at the center of the cross all of these things are being brought together in a very powerful way so now whether or not Rosicrucians exaggerated or went off the rails or because of their secret society status they were involved in some kind of weird political movement that's beyond well it's not totally beyond the point but is it possible for us to take these images back right to bring them back and to show their potential to participate in the Christian narrative so I know if it's something you thought about if you're going about it more intuitively oh yeah dude yeah I think about that all the time for sure that's a big it's a big part of my my art situation I guess you could say yeah well for me it's always like there's a really I guess you could say a fine line where on the one hand I think of it as like I never really want to like concede territory to some let's say ideologies or worldviews that I'm not really about like that's a perfect example like rose on the cross together like it is kind of classical like Christian medieval symbolism but certain groups have like used it so sometimes I'm sitting at my desk and I'm like yeah well I'm not going to give up this territory like I'm not never gonna use this because of this like group or whatever I had but then on the on the flip side of that like I do have kind of like a responsibility to not frankly make certain things look like really sexy and cool honestly I feel like a lot of the kind of like shadowy amorphous ideology stuff just gets by on it's like frankly like sex appealing because it looks really cool it's a lot a lot of it is like primarily aesthetic actually so yeah it's always a balance like a really good example of that is like astrology stuff I used to use like astrological glyphs and things like that in my work and it was never even really about astrology it was more just about like what it represented in terms of like the zodiac is like a cohesive symbol set but eventually I stopped because I didn't want to maybe you know like I'm saying give people kind of idea or maybe someone would see it and be like oh yeah like that is really cool I should get this book on astrology and then you know I've accidentally like promoted that so I go back and forth there's a few good examples for me one of the examples I always use is like a pentagram like you can go back and make like an academic case like oh well in medieval art like the pentagram represented you know the five wounds of Christ but at the same time I mean I think the ship is kind of sailed on that I'm not going to be like putting pentagrams in my art you know so so there's like oh there's like a fine line you could say gonta yeah well there is that I've been showing I've been actually I've had this argument about pentagrams with a few people where I tried to show that there is a pentagram structure in several Christian images that the most obvious one is the image of Christ on the throne with the four cherubs around him you have Christ's head in the at the top and you have these four points you know the four points of the four directions kind of going away from him so he appears it's actually exactly a pentagram symbolism because he is the top point as the head of these four manifestations of himself and so it's like I like you said I would never put a straight-up pentagram in the in my images of course but I say of course but I wouldn't because of the same reason you said but at the same time when someone tells me that that a pentagram is in itself evil or that in his it has in itself some kind of evil meaning that is included in the geometric shape itself I I can't I can't handle that like I just can't accept it I just have to I end up calling it out every time and say no a pentagram is a is a very powerful shape it's very it has a lot of meaning in it and it's it's there's nothing illegitimate about it now we obviously don't want to be a stumbling stone for people as well but we have to understand what it is if understanding what a pentagram is it's very useful because you can understand what it means to have something above four corners like to have something that is a top four manifestations right so the four Gospels or the four directions or something like that so it can be useful but I understand but I see that like for example I noticed that you use the all-seeing eye like you use the eye the divine I which the same with the roads in the cross is such a it's an image which precedes any form of Illuminati existence like it's a head you see the medieval churches I had a crazy example recently there's a church nearby in this small city of in Quebec and in one of the arches of the the roof of the church there was a the ceiling of the church there was an all-seeing eye and we were doing a tour of the church and a guy looked at it is and said to his friend he said oh that means that this is an Illuminati Church I was like what you're completely insane there's there's all-seeing eyes in churches all over the all over the world from the Middle Ages until the modern world so it's not him doesn't mean that Freemasons were involved in building that church yeah the church there was probably the least Illuminati place in the city probably right I mean it's like I don't think there were a lot of Illuminati in in French Canadian peasant culture like I'm not I'm sure there wasn't a lot of that going on yeah yeah I always think of this story there's I obviously wish I could find out I remember reading it somewhere but it was something like these like townspeople were talking about how the full moon is like the time when like The Devil's active and how the full moon is like this evil symbol and I think it was a saint or someone so I'm like holy person was like you know actually what the devil does is he just he just chooses to do things when the moon is full so that you guys associate evil with the full moon and then this really beautiful thing God made become this like perverted symbol of evil and I really really like that like little like tail and that's something else I think about also like you know an owl is another perfect example like yeah secret societies using owls but like at the same time I mean God made out Sam I like never gonna put one in my art probably not right well yeah no you're right exactly exactly the same but I think we can also do a service to the world by re explaining this symbolism in a way that is more powerful than giving them over to the dark side like you said like we just let the dark side have this symbolism then we're actually making ourselves weaker rather if we are able to reclaim it in a way that's legitimate it's not just you know not just random but we can do it in a way that's legitimate and can help people understand the deeper me then then I think we can do it like you know when you see someone you see that kind of weird conspiracy side that sometime that goes off the rails you know when they see two pillars and an arch and they think as soon as they see two pillars in an arch all of a sudden it's like this is this is like Freemason or this is evil like dude you can't you can't do that not two pillars on an arch my goodness like you're basically eliminating all of architecture just with that strange that strange enter that there's a keystone like if they see a keystone they think oh that's freemason like the Keystone is not three Mason there's actually when you see that that um the quote of Christ when he talks about how the stone that was rejected by the Builders became the top of the angle it's like that's he's it seems like it's referring to something like a keystone or a capstone rather than just the corner of an angle because it's misshaped and right it's it doesn't have the same shape as the others and so it ends up being the final stone which holds everything together so Christ is actually using architectural symbolism to talk about himself so if you're gonna give that to your enemies that you see as your enemies you're gonna give that to them then you're missing out on something totally yeah yeah I couldn't agree more honestly and so what is your because I've so I'm looking at a bunch of images of you that you're doing and you really seem to be exploring more and more kind of Christian symbolism and you're you're using so you even made an icon of st. Herman like a saint Herman of Alaska tell me a little bit a bit about what attracts you to st. Herman oh that's a cool one well yeah just just off the bat I mean some people listen this probably don't know me I'm not famous yeah just kidding but yeah all my work is Christian for sure like even if I'm just drawing like a flower or something like that like I'm doing it like being like a Christian context so it's throwing that out there um yeah well I made this image of st. Herman because for a few reasons I guess working backwards I'm really into Seraphim Rose who's a really big like influence on me partially because the case people aren't familiar with his work the main in Rose for me was he has a book called orthodoxy and the religion of the future and even before I ever would have thought about Christianity at all someone told me this theory that UFOs were related to demonology and that like UFOs were a extension of you know the demon illogical phenomenon from the past and that just totally blew my mind I was really kind of into the paranormal at the time and I was like why never would have thought of that that came from Seraphim row so I read the book and he's a really cool guy even outside of that I don't want to pigeonhole him is like the UFO demons guy and he's associated with st. Herman's monastery in Alaska so I started looking into it and I just thought he was a really cool figure and I really liked the idea I mean I'm American also in case people don't know I just really liked the idea of Christianity coming to America in the most general sense whether it was orthodoxy or Catholicism or anything really and so he was a really interesting figure in that context I'm pretty sure he's this patron I wouldn't say patron saint but he's like called the wonder-worker of the Americas or something in the church and yeah he's a really cool guy I really liked his life story which I kind of Illustrated like in this image here and yeah I just felt kind of a kinship with him I guess you could say not that I'm like similar to him but I kind of felt an affinity for him that mean reward yeah and the image that really I guess this is related to what you're talking about so I'll bring it up because the image that that someone posted and then I saw that really kind of struck me and then got me connected to you is the image of the mother of God cutting off the cutting off the aliens head yes yeah if I like a if I'd like a greatest hits album that would definitely the crowds would definitely put that on there for sure I love it and I love the fact that you see also you see like the sea serpent there are many images in that there are many things in there where you see the sea serpent getting his head cut in the in the waters totally yeah this image is actually a really good encapsulation of like what I'm about just in general honestly when I drew it just so also I feel like I should just like qualify a little bit like I really do take the creating imagery that would be perceived as religious or spiritual thing like really seriously so like when I drew this I wasn't thinking like oh this is a picture of Virgin Mary I just kind of drew it as like a somewhat generic like holy woman so just so people know I'm not over here like doodling like you know and kind of taking it very flippantly I guess you could say like rendering like holy figures and stuff you can see actually the st. Herman of Alaska a mage is like totally different than this one because he's like you know a historical person this is just like a generic figure so to clarify well I wouldn't say I would like for sure I wouldn't say it's an icon especially in my Orthodox context like I don't think this as an icon of the Virgin Mary but it's obviously a figure which you call some because you put a crown on top of her head and you start up in the heavens it's the illusions are very strong yeah definitely yeah yeah but yeah this image would be like a really perfect encapsulation of my vibe honestly you have this like holy woman like beheading this alien over on the left was like the angel coming down with like Noah's Ark I was thinking about the Nephilim and stuff like that that this guy getting abducted in the bottom right I guess yeah you could say that part of a part of what I'm about is really like integrating all of these things into a view of the world that is theological I guess you could say you know I was into conspiracies for a long time nothing nothing too crazy just saying maybe like you know Bigfoot UFO nothing too crazy there either and you know little things like that and then I feel like when I started getting a more theological understanding of the universe even just little things like you know why is evil happen and why are things the way they are it all becomes integrated in this way so yeah pairing the theological imagery with more unexpected things I guess you could say is that probably big part of what I'm about so the one weird thing about that image the one which I'm wondering about and I'll be honest is just the image of the ladder with the devil like atop the ladder yeah totally yeah so over on the left there's the I mean sorry on the right there's the guy getting abducted from his house yeah into like the night and then above that he's getting led up this ladder and there's like the devil there don't like snatch him like at the top of the ladder and there's also Saturn over there I kind of like intentionally put that some yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah basically what it's about is that I felt like there there's this whole aspect to the UFO and paranormal thing in general where I really do feel like is kind of designed to like ensnare people and maybe lead them down these like wrong roads there's a lot of stories like that I mean I could go into it but there's some many many stories where someone would get like just obsessed with like particular my anusha of alien abduction experiences or their soul starts seeing UFOs everywhere and often it'll like totally destroy their life on yeah yeah or things like you know beings like that kind of leading people into like a weird like sciency Gnostic II cosmic II New Age religion worldview so that's what I was thinking over there it's like the guy gets abducted and then he's led up this ladder like to the devil and I guess it looks a little weird cuz it's like in the heavens but what I was thinking was that you know in his mind he's like oh I'm going up this ladder like I'm ascending but then at the top it has a surprise like has a bad surprise yeah yeah I get I can I can kind of get it just it's just because the ladder especially in an iconography is associated with like the Jacob's Ladder so like the idea of going up the ladder is usually associated with like going coming near God but because it's almost like you could call like the false ascent or something like the ascent of pride is what seems to be did to be to be represented but I like the idea of the of the of the person getting abducted by aliens and then coming up and realizing that it's it's the devil yeah if I did if I did this again now it would be cool to have like a longer like more classically like angled ladder on the left side that maybe did like go all the way up to the heavens or something so it'd be like more of an obvious like comparison yeah well you could you could like a good way could be to show the flip because it's almost like a flip you're at you you get abducted into a spaceship so you're physically going up like into the spirits of the air or something and then with what's actually happening is you're actually going down the lap they're going down the slide like you're actually sliding down into the mouth of hell do you look at the images of the Last Judgement you'll get you might get something some ideas about that you see this either like a snake starting at the foot of Christ going it's kind of sliding you down into the mouth of Hell or sometimes there's like a array of fire which comes down from Christ's foot and then that people kind of ride down into the into the mouth of the of the of the monster yeah I've seen those it's something we kind of touched on just like really quickly before but yeah that's one thing that got me hooked into I guess you could say sacred art in general even when I was just kind of starting my path was the ability to read it and kind of get information out of it was something that I thought was really awesome I was making images and I was painting but I'd kind of been more schooled in like a you know 16 17 1800 s like oil painting kind of aesthetic situation so then when I started seeing images and I was like wow this guy basically wrote a book that I'm looking at and I'm like I'm unpacking all of this and it's telling me so much that really like changed my artistic path forever yeah that's I think I had the same experience when I discovered medieval art and especially um especially that church decorations because the church decorations they they appear as this this like 3d system of imagery that are relating to each other that are kind of playing off each other and so it ends up being really like a system of meaning that is that is manifesting itself to you you know that you can it's a pattern really like it's a pattern of it's an algebraic pattern and so that's what I like about your work is I did that's what it feels like as well so you have this you put up all these images next to each other and they create these analogies that then bring out the the meaning yeah totally sorry do you want to say something no I'm just gonna say yeah I spend a lot of time like in different I think that's also part of what I took away from being a part of different kind of like worldviews I guess you could say is after you kind of do the whole survey like every worldview theology religion whatever it is has its sacred art that kind of carries its worldview in it and that was one of my other main motivations for kind of doing what I do is that I felt like for our modern culture there's not really that there's not really like oh here's a clear thing that embodies like our kind of like spiritual experience at this moment that's how I felt at the time anyway so yeah that was something else I wanted to help help work on and so who like who what kind of people do you feel are the ones who are responding to your work right now like what's your quits your public like that's interesting man I feel like I'm in the overlap of a lot of Venn diagram yeah that's what I feel too that's why I asked yeah it's pretty interesting it's interesting too because you know I I think it's people that I mean on the one hand well I guess you could say the main kind of core in my opinion because this is kind of how I feel and where I come in it from is that I feel like there's a lot of people who have been like young guys at least I don't know vicious guys but in my mind I'm a guy whatever uh-huh like young guys maybe who for a while it's kind of like eventually you wake up to like wow like things in society are really on ideal and there's all these like large forces and like I'm actually really like maybe angry or not happy with this and I really don't like it and I feel like at first you're on the surface level of that like maybe there's some like particular political issue you're interested in and yeah it's probably important but then you kind of like go deeper and you untangle all these like webs of these interconnected wires and I feel like eventually it kind of leads you to like a theological view of things where you're like oh there is like good and evil and it's more than just like things generated in the human mind you know so I feel like I get a lot of people like that who are like yeah I have some kind of inkling that there's some like theological nature to things and I feel like I don't know if I explained it well but yeah that's how that's what I feel like it's kind of like the core of people people who I guess you could say are interested in culture and society and how it's going yeah and then that has dovetailed with a theological understanding of the world because that's me but then also on top of that yeah there's other people who are just into like weird like what I call like third I weird stuff like could be like Bigfoot or UFOs or anything a lot of people who have maybe been on a similar path to me who are like yeah I used to really be really into like psychedelics and stuff and now I'm like kind of just floating and then also people who maybe are Christian or have been Christian but just enjoy seeing like a different embodiment of it I guess you could say I get a lot of messages like that you know I think that's the other thing is like I'm very like realistic about Who I am and what I do like you know you mentioned before like yeah I would never like call this an icon like yeah in my mind like I'm like on the bottom I'm like a little pawn on the whole chess board of like Christian stuff happening and I'm just a little pawn that makes like my cool weird images so yeah I think some people get a kick out of that so think so a lot of Oakland diagrams overlapping yeah and I often talk about in my in my work I talk about the notion of the narthex or the art of the nach narthex and the idea of the bridge art or the limit liminal art right and so that's when I saw you work I kind of right away felt like that's one of the roles you seem to play and when you're just you're discussing the type of people that are interested in your work it seems to make sense that it would be those kinds of people you know because because there is an aspect like I said to see yourself like at the bottom using imagery from popular culture and and and kind of weird culture but then also connecting it to more formal iconography is something that would happen at the bottom or on the edge or you know in a place like the narthex which is a transition between inside and outside so you can have like you said people were coming from psychedelic it's coming for all this stuff and then all of a sudden realizing that okay this Christian II which I always thought was stupid all my life because every all my teachers told me it was stupid and all culture told me it was stupid all of a sudden it's like oh wait a minute no there's something else going on here I don't know how to grasp at it yet I don't know how to attach myself to it yet but here's something that I you know here are these types of images that are and it's slowly bringing me towards a fuller understanding and something like that totally yeah yeah there's this guy I really like named benoit mandelbrot he kind of like popularized you wouldn't say discovered but he kind of made like fractals a thing and like science and mathematics and he has this quote which is all established fields oh a great debt to those scholars who are nomads by choice because that's how he felt you know he's not an artist but all his work is visual he's not really a scientist because it's more like the radical math but he's not really a mathematician because it's all about the natural world kind of so I've always really identified with that archetype where it's like you know I'm not a theologian but I really like theology I'm not a sociologist but I'm really into analyzing culture and I think a lot of people can identify with that especially now when things are kind of getting more in mesh than ever mmm yeah that makes sense I think that your work has that quality to it to a kind of a kind of hybrid monster kind of hybrid monster work but there's a word there's a place for that I talked about st. Christopher a lot and the the imagery of the of the monster as being important like the gargoyle all of this stuff is also part of the Christian tradition we just have to understand its role like it's a kind of thing where I always joke about that because I make t-shirts and I make all this stuff tonight and I and I say things like you know yeah I make t-shirts and but if I saw priests wearing my t-shirt in the altar I would physically eject him from the altar like things are just have their place you know if they're in the right place then they're fine it's the same with your images like if like I love the images you're making but if I some if I saw someone painting in the middle of that lady decapitating an alien like in the apse of a church I'd be like dude you need to be excommunicated you know it's just about it's all about plates totally definitely so I have a question it's almost like a technical question but so in your work there's a there's a little thing that appears a lot and it's like this square with the triangle in it and I'm trying to like figure out what what it's what it's reference like there there's a version of it on the hand of this holy lady decapitating the alien you see it there's an image of us oh yeah nice yeah totally yeah the guy in the church it's called the amateur theologian I like never title my work but that one is a title like yeah amateur theologian that's a great image yeah I drew this because honestly like sometimes I'm working and purely like you know oh I want to explore this idea but I actually drew this because it's like really how I feel and how I felt especially like at that time where it's kind of like you're you know you're just like some random guy but like you really want figure out these like huge theological issues that are like way beyond your comprehension or like you know still your beyond your station in life let's say see I drew this guy he's almost like anguished I guess like like like screaming out kind of just like just because what I just said he like knows he's like just this one random guy but he wants like figure it out so yeah that's really literally how I feel all the time uh yeah that it's supposed to be like a little Jam like a little like diamond or like a little jewel mm-hmm that little square thing he's holding I basically used that for a few reasons I often have it on well well I kind of picked it up I guess you could say I did this image of Saint Augustine that's probably my other most popular images and I took it from this Renaissance painting of him being coronated him being like crowned and they're crowning him with these white gloves and on the white gloves is a big gem on the back of the glove and I just drew it without really thinking much about it and someone told me there were these special gloves yeah I think if you search for like coronation of st. Augustine it's on the Wikipedia page I'm pretty sure - someone told me there were these gloves they would wear and the jewel represents like one of the wounds of Christ on his hand and there would be these like red gems to represent like those wounds basically so yeah that's why I see I see that yeah yeah so I guess you could say like I don't really expect other people to like pick up on it necessarily but I often use it in that way where it's like this red gem red often correlates with like passion and like the passion and like suffering in some way to mean so I kind of thought of it that way it's like this like redemptive aspect of like suffering in my mind again I wouldn't expect anyone to like pick up on that but also the gem is kind of an interesting symbol because gems are made deep down in like the hidden parts of the earth where there's like a ton of pressure and you know all this time and these huge like almost cosmological like geological forces but they produce these like beautiful wonders that then we have to dig down deep in the earth to get so obviously that's some like level of symbolism there where like you know you have to dig down to like find these things that are like hidden in the earth but ultimately you know are really beautiful because they from this like dark weird inaccessible place yeah so yeah it's kinda like what I think about the gem symbolism yeah the gem symbolism is important because it especially for Christians it's important because it it's exactly what you said it's it's related also to fish symbolism which might sound surprising at first yeah it's the idea of shiny things in the darkness right and so that that in the darkness are hiding that life is hiding in the darkness and that Christ one of the roles that Christ has is to go down and to gather the fish gather what is alive in the dark places so save us from death go down into death and take the souls out of death as part of it but it's also this idea that the seeds are hidden in the world right the seeds of meaning the seeds of let's say the hidden presence of God is there in the world if you can dig in and find the hidden gems right the parable of the pearl in the field that you know the man who sells his field who buys this field to have the pearl or all these images of like little things like small things the seeds and and fish and everything so yeah so the Jam is perfect in that sense because you like you said you you actually go down into darkness into these dark caves and then you find these glowing things it's almost as if they have they brought light down into darkness right they brought they they're they're shiny and and so then they're so then that ends up being the last the last image of the world - is the city which is covered in gems uhm yeah nice that's true actually yeah yeah yeah it also makes me think about you know like society's relationship to those things because the gym is also it's almost like money like it inherently has like a financial value but it's deeper symbolism has like nothing to do with that like commodification so I'll sometimes think of it in that way it's like something that society has taken and been like oh hey you know this is worth a lot of money right but it's like actual value has like nothing to do with that yeah yeah no you're told that you're totally right and there's also there's also an interesting tradition about the idea this is more of a Jewish tradition but it's interesting to think about that the first tablets that Moses made you know when Moses when Moses received the tablets from God the law that the first tablets the ones he broke were made out of like a gem because it just says they're stone tablets we always imagine the stone tablets as being like granite or something but but the idea that the first tablets would have been gems and then the second tablets would have been more coarser like coarser material is related to this idea of something coming down like that has to be brought down lower in order to be seen but also the idea of raising something from the earth up so that it becomes full of light like this gems that come up also gonna be facet gems and so we we in order to make them even more resplendent we have to make them geometric right we have to make them into like geometric shapes so all of that totally is totally I think it's very the symbolism jambs is really something that I probably should make a video on at some point because it is very fascinating so where are you seeing like where do you see yourself going because that you talked about before we started recording you talked about how you're almost you're almost becoming overwhelmed right now with commissions and so where do you see yourself going in terms of choosing your projects going you know what direction would you like to go with your art well yeah it's kind of the main thing on my mind right now well my setup is I used to live in I used to live in a really big city and then for a variety of reasons I just kind of packed it all up and moved out to kind of the middle of nowhere style and yeah I'm really just trying to do my art and have it work both as an outlet for everything we've talked about but also I may hate singing this way but it's reality of like the world like kind of like a business I guess you could say I don't like have a family and stuff like eventually so yeah it's been really interesting man because the last year I basically just been learning how to run my little studio and I do have like a little studio it's a little room that I'm in right now and just figuring out how to run it and everything how I want to balance projects I'm really lucky actually because there's not really a conflict between what I see as projects that would make the studio functional in terms of like me being able to afford to eat and then also things that I do want to be doing I'm really lucky both of those things have synced up perfectly I don't really know what I would do otherwise if I had to like fake you know stuff that was gonna be like commercially like viable but I'm lucky that I doubt so yeah basically figuring out how to run things man I really want to start stepping up the caliber of what I'm outputting I'm kind of at this point where I always think of things in terms of like weaponry analogies like I have these like little armies out and all the armies are doing pretty well so now I'm back in the lab working on like you know beaker more powerful weaponry for them comics is something I've been exploring that I feel like I have a lot of like potential on I made a really long comic about like sex and pornography and my own like experiences with it recently some more like weird tale comics also the same style is what you've got going now yeah it's actually on my website under comics if you go to my website so in cyclops calm by the way that's the plug under comics it should be there actually is it there I can send you the PDF right now I don't it might not be there yet actually but I'll send it to you right now yeah I'd be interested just because that's the comics is something that I've been I've been kind of diving into oh yeah I saw that you were working on working on the comments now I mean I'm not the one I'm not the artist it's gonna need someone else but I when I wrote it with my brother and so yeah I'm excited to see I think the potential of comics is really great for someone's interested in symbolism you know and it's been taken by the dark side I would say you know you've got people like like Alan Moore who's just such an amazing has such an amazing grasp on symbolic laying out of symbolic structures within a page and so it's like I just see him as my nemesis or something like I need me you know that's what you're shooting for and I suppose I'm gonna shoot high cuz he's really good he's really good at doing that totally yeah so I send it to you right now as a PDF yeah the comic thing is something I really like a lot because I enjoy the informational aspect of being an illustrator that's the other thing also I really use the term illustrator intentionally because I'm not really a fine artist like my work you meant to like just Hank like not that anyone would want this but like hang in the museum or something like that I really do make like illustrations where I tend to be like casually enjoyed in this like other kind of like liminal space so yeah the comics thing is really cool for me because I like writing but I'm not a writer I would never really sit down and just write a story but when it's paired with the images then I really do feel like it's something that I I mean I think I'm good at it obviously I do it but yeah there's a lot of power there so I made this comic it's just called sex it's about like my kind of history with like sex and pornography and stuff so I thought a lot of like young men could like relate to it yeah so totally different than my other stuff but also oddly like completely related to it and yeah one of my plans is I kind of do want to do like a longer like graphic novel like that where I basically just go through these like particular things that like I personally like had to deal with that I feel like a lot of like other people have also wrestled with it also really fits in with like the Christian theology thing because ultimately it's kind of how I ended up there so that's something that I'm working on it's kind of like a long-term project where basically go through and talk about like sex and drugs and cult and all this stuff and then have it all build up to like me kind of you know figuring it out a little bit more I think that's a great idea for a story just because it's so relevant to what's happening now and and you know the this moment let's say where you have the kind of new atheist type atheism it's kind of breaking down and because that has that has positive aspect but also has negative aspects which people are looking for kind of spiritual sustenance but then they're looking all around and you know not always finding the best let's say so it's it that could be a really good story to tell totally yeah it's funny too because honestly like it's a lot of stuff that I really never thought I would talk about like you know I'm on Twitter I'm you know it's a toen broadcast by the way other plug yeah yeah it's not I never imagined myself to be this guy who's like hey by the way like I used to drink a lot like here's what that was like I'm like hey by the way like I did ayahuasca like because I feel like I'm the psychedelic stuff is something I really never thought I'd end up talking about a lot because I thought everyone's been at a party or someone's like hey you know I did ayahuasca and it was crazy man I'm like I never want to be that guy but then I go on like my sisters like Normie Facebook and like vice news is like hey do ayahuasca Lindsay Lohan did ayahuasca like go on the view they're gonna talk about ayahuasca and I'm like okay kind of house I like push back against this a tiny bit yeah no I agree because people in my own circle people that I admire you know have been have been let's say seen to it seems like they seem to be pushing psychedelics as some kind of a solution and you know I've never done psychedelics alright it's not like I can I can speak out of experience but I I do feel like there's a there's an aspect of the message that's missing and we need to be careful as people kind of see this as some solution to their problems that they think that they're going to find it there you know you there is no chemical solution to your problems in you know in terms of spirituality it's not that's not possible it's not how that's not any of this stuff works yeah I also feel like you know I would normally feel frankly like arrogant hey everyone like listen to me about this thing but for me it's more like there's really no and this also fits in with like the you know Christian worldview tying in with like how culture is going and stuff I feel like there's just no push back against it at all I think that most people probably 99% of people have probably never heard anyone make the statement of like yeah I used to do cycle at psychedelics a ton and here's why I think that is not a viable spiritual path I think that in everyone's mind is kind of just this reefer madness thing where it's like whoa don't take acid like you'll turn into a glass of orange juice or something but uh I think the intelligent case being made against that stuff is almost at zero that goes a lot of other things that I'm not really about anymore but yeah it's one of the only reasons why I kind of like started talking about it more is that I was like wow no one is either no one's equipped to push back against it or no one's doing it or I just haven't found them yet but uh well I think that that's maybe one of the issues one of the issues is that let's say like I in my normy state in the sense that I like I've never done psychedelic so I don't have the tools to push against it either and I just kind of see it weird like I I've noticed that a lot of the things that well one of the things that I have noticed is that despite the fact that people tell me how much insight psychedelics bring brings them when I talk to people who've done a lot of psychedelics I don't necessarily feel like they have more insight and so I mean it not to be arrogant but I just I just don't see your insight I see tell me you have insight but I don't see you able to communicate that insight somehow to the world around you so so because of that it's like I'm like I don't know man I I don't want to be I don't like I said I want to be the idiot and just say drugged bad drug bad don't do drugs but at the same time I was like I don't I haven't seen I haven't seen let's say that it that it necessarily gives something good you know it seemed like a chemical tool like any other chemical tool totally yeah yeah well it's funny actually gonna fix with like to hold the whole fool thing that maybe we'll talk about later but I think that in a lot of cases it's almost and this goes with like frankly everything that I'm kind of against and like society honestly it's a very like Emperor New Clothes style situation where the lie is kind of like so thick and everyone kind of takes it for granted that it really takes someone who is kind of willing to like maybe even look like an idiot to be like hey actually like everyone's saying the down is up but have you ever thought about the up is up and then people are like well actually I never I never like thought about that actually and I feel like that about second honestly dude like the whole time that I was in that world with a ton of different people doing in a ton of different contexts all over like whatever I feel like there was almost never anyone who expressed any skepticism whatsoever and the first time that I had someone be like hey have you ever thought about like maybe this isn't like a hundred percent great I was like wow it's almost why I actually actually I haven't ever thought about that Wow so yeah it's a very I love damper New Clothes story especially now because that's like really how it is like you need a little kid to be like what if do it what if smoking weed literally all the time is bad and you're like oh yeah what if that is bad like so yeah do some people are sitting and they're like what are you talking about but yeah people in that world know I'm talking about it I feel obliged to reach out to people that are kind of like in the same tide pool that I used to be in let's say so some people probably are like what are you talking about but some people are like that's yeah all right so now what I want to talk about because you've been talking for a while but I do want to talk about the image that we kind of made together so I I've had this this theme in my mind where I've been talking about the notion of the fool my brother as well talks about this quite a bit in his book the language of creation the idea that the the fool is always turning and he's always turning things but the strange thing happens when things are already upside down when the world is already upside down is that the fool will continue turning and then we'll end up reinstating the though that's a reinstating authority or reinstating the king and so I had this idea that of a Joker card which could have a joker on one side and a king on the other and they could it looks like the Joker was turning the king and I actually tried to draw it myself and then I was like now this is not good like I just it's just not the type of image of that I'm really that I'm really it comes close to the art I'm doing it so you just didn't never look right and then when I saw your art I thought okay this guy this guy he's the one who can put it together and so you did and I love it I just think it's so awesome so maybe you can tell me a bit about the process you went through to kind of to kind of bring this image together nice nice cool well I'm glad you I'm glad you feel that way I'm glad I was able to step in in our role yeah I'm super cool working with you and doing it um process wise well yeah you told me about that idea and it's something that I resonated with really strongly I mean you take on Commission so I think you probably know there's a spectrum of someone being like hey can you draw this and you're like yeah I probably could and then sometimes people are like I can you draw this and you're like oh yeah yeah I could definitely draw that so yeah something I resonated with really strongly um I really really really the fool archetype is like a big part of like what I'm about for sure so I guess we can go into that more but yeah I really resonated with it and in terms of the vision like the purely visual like purely putting it together like in a visual sense yeah I felt like it was perfect for my style because like you were saying before it's almost like everything in my art is kind of like flat but in this weird way where it's like flat but also kind of like has depth I think I got that from the medieval art where you know it's like the picture plane that you're looking at isn't really a window into a three-dimensional space it's almost utilizing like the flat make sure of the surface you're looking at to convey information to the viewer so yeah we talked about it a little bit since some sketches back and forth I think the most interesting thing for me was conveying the idea behind it of like the fool really flipping the King over and we got this like spin with the cards on the back but yeah one of the things I liked about it and that we hadn't talked about because I just said you know I'd like the fool to be like kind of grabbing the King and flipping him over one of the things I like and I don't even know if you did it on purpose so you can tell me if you did but I like the fact that he's that he's not taking the king by the hand right he's grabbing him by the arm and it almost looks like the king is resisting it's AMA look if the king is resisting he doesn't actually want this to happen but if the fools like gasps sorry buddy this is happening like orders coming back even if the King doesn't want it to happen yeah no totally yeah yeah that was definitely intentional yeah when I'm working with I guess all my work is kind of like this when I'm working with more of like a simplified like I keep using this word but informational way of like conveying visuals people's body language even like really subtle aspects of it it's something that I really really think about a lot probably an extent that people would probably find like kind of weird so yeah I definitely made an intentional because I wanted to make it clear that he was like the leader pulling him I had this art teacher once and she she did this exercise where she had people line up and she went to hand someone a pencil and before she gave him the pencil she had them freeze she went to hand someone a you know a ball and had them freeze handsome and somebody else had them freeze and you could see that their hands even just the way they were the frozen people the way they were positioned you could tell what object they were about to receive from how their hands were and that really made me realize that yeah like everything about someone's body language even how their fingers are anything conveys like their state and you know what they're doing and what they're feeling so yeah I made it I made an intentional for sure and it's also even with the thumb out it's kind of like he's like pulling yeah as well like casually kind of like authoritative Lee like whoa here we go like flipping over so yeah that was definitely intentional yeah that's awesome so tell me a bit about you The Fool why you feel the fool is something that you connect with yeah probably for a lot of reasons on a purely like I guess not purely surface level but in the most like basic way I feel like you know tying back to like the Emperor's New Clothes thing I feel like we're dealing with like a world whether you're like into politics or just culture or even just theology and religion or just living your life and hanging out we're kind of dealing with a world where things are so inverted and people get like the wrong idea about what you're saying and there's all these kind of like informational archetypes launch like I'm sure anyone watching this probably has been in a conversation where you know you say something and then what the other person here is it's like a stereotype of what you're saying and then they can't actually hear the words that you're trying to get out and I feel like the fool is like a really powerful way of like bypassing that it's almost like the fool is able to cut through all the rules of like how language and information is meant to be structured in society and because of that he can get at these deeper truths without attracting these like you know crosshairs onto him come that's one of the one of the aspects of a gesture you know the gesture could even like critique the King because he's like quote-unquote like just joking and that's something I've always resonated with really strongly the whole time I've been you know doing anything like this even when I was just posting on Twitter and stuff you know I'd get people damning me all the time like hey this is really cool but like are you joking or not like I can't tell and I feel like that lets me honestly I kind of like get away with a lot of stuff because you know if you feel strongly about anything if you just come out and you're like oh I feel you know it doesn't only matter what it is let's say it's gun control it doesn't matter if you just make a post that's like hey we should all be allowed to own these guns everyone's kind of like okay like whatever but if you make it something funny or make it like a joke or maybe like subtly you know then it gets a lot more traction and people are more interested in it and especially with something more controversial than that whatever it would be you can reach more people if it's kind of like hey I'm just joking but like am I just joking like you can't really tell there's there's this alchemy book I never actually I just thought in a bookstore once but it was called a serious joke and I really just loved that title cuz it's like yeah it's a joke but what the fools saying can also be like serious there's not actually that I kata me there that people imagine yeah well that's what the people who are using memes right now those that are using memes almost in a weaponized manner that's what they understand you know all the four chan 8chan types they understand how the use of irony's and double irony's and all of this is a way to it's like an in and it's a way to kind of change the world without people understanding exactly what's going on yeah exactly exactly there's also kind of the The Fool also dovetails with like certain elements of like mysticism I guess you could say maybe you know like there's the fools for Christ and like Eastern Christianity and then in Western Christianity there's also the kind of like the mystical fool Arco st. Francis is really that I mean he's usually he's usually not people don't seem to see it that way but Fran st. Francis does all the things that the fool that the fool does like he he undresses himself in public he does all kinds of crazy stuff you know so he's definitely a fool - fool type as well totally yeah I also feel like when we live in this world that is such like a um I don't even know what to call it almost like a cult of like this particular type of like intellectualism where it's like you have these like intellectual authorities they're kind of like are telling you what to think I guess would be the most basic way to put it The Fool has like a really interesting role to play in all that I guess you could say ya know the fool is is undermining that's the that's the rule of the fool and he's and so it's sometimes it's dangerous right sometimes it can be it if it goes too far in one direction sometimes it can be a destabilizing force um in small doses it's actually healthy because like you said it prevents the king from puffing himself up or thinking that he's self-sufficient right some point the authority thinks that they've got it covered when the fool is there to say yeah you know what this this thing that you're hiding here you know this secret that you got is not it's showing that there's there's a piece there's some stones lacking in your Tower of Babel you know and so that fool is useful for that as well um but I'm really for now at least I'm really interested rather in how because the the revolutionary types the those that were there to destabilize society to a certain extent because they become so powerful and they've actually taken over and a lot of the institutions then the fool in that role now the sudden is looks very strange because the fool is actually trying to take power away from those that were that we're trying to be revolutionary and so it's just interesting because it really goes for this strange double irony where it's like what happens when those what happens when contemporary art you know the thing in terms of just art into why art which is there supposedly to be transgressive is now in in the guggenheim all over the world and there are these multi-million dollar buildings and are being propped up by the institutions like what is going on how is it possible that something which is supposed to be to be questioning authority is now taken up by the highest authority well that's when the fool of a sudden you know becomes a very strange figure because the fool is bringing back iconography like in your case you're like bringing back iconography using almost like a subversive language which is still there but it's it's pointing towards something else and so and that's one of the reason why I liked it were two because I can see that that double flip that I talked about or this double inversion where you know someone who is using imagery that is that looks subversive at first glance like when I look at your work at first glance I it looks like graffiti or looks like you know kind of esoteric weird esoteric stuff but as soon as you do a double glance you see oh no and there's something else going on it's actually pointing towards something else so yeah that's something else I kind of picked up that I guess really actually does fit with the fool archetype someone I really liked I mean I still like him he's still cool is Bill Watterson the guy that did Calvin and Hobbes mm-hmm and he actually talked about kind of what you were just getting out a little bit where because it's like quote-unquote like just a newspaper comic and people aren't expecting something deep from it when he did do a comic about like you know maybe like a bird dying or something like that he could kind of just like sneak in like a big punch and get at these like way deeper things themes because oh it's like just a comic it's just this like little thing it's kinda like the fool like oh I'm just playing around and then boom you like sneak in something that otherwise people would have like a ton of filters up for ya and it acts as almost like a Zen : right it actually goes really deep and will like shock it can shock your worldview in a way that you you weren't prepared for right but you weren't guarding for let say and so yeah it can have a very deep effect I totally agree yeah that was the other thing that I really responded to about your initial kind of like our discussion about it was like the idea of you know what happens when things are already inverted and you have this figure that inverts things it's actually like a really interesting like paradox I guess that's kind of what I was getting at with like the the cult of like intellectualism I guess you could say because we're kind of this in this position where like you know things are so much about like having the right view and trusting like the right authorities and stuff that I feel like the fool plays into that and an interesting way too because it's almost like we're in this position where like the smartest questions you can ask will sound to most people like the dumbest questions you could ask and I feel like that's kind of a big part of like how I got led down this road and everything you know like we're all like so confident and all this like you know scientific explanations for the universe but then you're like yeah but like where we're the first like living thing come from you know it sounds like kind of a dumb question but it's not really or like yeah why are there like all these things around or you know I always think of Isaac Newton for example you know kind of a bridge between like esoterica and science like this the classic like tale of him like sitting under a tree and then being like you know wait why do apples like fall down like what's up with that I thought there's some fool energy there just asking like the dumbest question possible and then it leads you to you know changing the world the whole world yeah totally all right man I think I think I think we've had a great conversation I tend to have these go for now we've been going even more so so I'm really looking forward to seeing how people are going to react to this image we did together so people write down your your your comments your ideas in the in the comments section we can see you know what you think and yeah who knows he could lead to maybe some more collaborations that could be fun totally man Yahoo should stay on each other's radar I'm definitely down we could talk more whatever I think we have an interesting you know with certain overlap certain things are different so yeah I really enjoy talking you man I'm super interesting yeah thanks for coming out yeah thanks for having me here hope you enjoyed my discussion with Owen Cyclops make sure to check out the image we made together in my TSP account and see if it's something you would be interested in getting this is really a collaboration we did together and so for each t-shirt or merch item that is sold a part of the profits that goes directly to Owen as well so everybody thanks for your attention and I will see you soon
