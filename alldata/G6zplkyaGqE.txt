hey friends we are going to be building a tool 
that will display location data in Bing Maps using   open Edge and specifically version 12.6 openedge 
is a platform that I recently came across well   not really recent I would say it's been a few 
months now I was blown away by their app Dev   platform and their Advanced business language abl 
so we are going to be using that to build today   I'll pull up on screen here openedge so you can 
learn a little bit more about the tool we will be   using openedge essentially supercharges Enterprise 
app development so you are able to build Dynamic   multi-language apps with secure deployment let 
me pull up the project on screen here so you can   see we have employee number name last name phone 
number and email and this data is coming from the   demo in open Edge in their database specifically 
if you go onto screen here you can see we have   a rest API that is returning the data for the 
employee data so once again the number the name   last name home phone number and email address 
also too I want to note that the demo I'm going   to be going through to day is one that was made in 
collaboration with openedge I just wouldn't feel   right if I didn't shout out the amazing developers 
who work at progress who developed the open Edge   platform let's get into it foreign before we dive 
into it let's talk about some prerequisites which   are pretty standard for these type of things 
and for this we are using abl as the programming   language for the business Logic on the server wait 
to explain to me what exactly is an abl stands   for advanced business language it's a language 
with its purpose to express business Concepts as   efficiently as possible I was blown away by their 
application server which they refer to as Paz for   openedge also for more information on paths for 
openedge I linked it down below we are adding   these fields to the temp table definition so that 
this data can be returned from the application   server the openedge abl the programming language 
in the progress openedge application platform   really makes things efficient we do not need 
to even update the buffer copy statement as   it already knows internally which Fields can be 
copied the abl language is tightly coupled to the   database so doing database operations like getting 
the customer data in this example is simply a   matter of a for loop with a single line of code to 
fetch the data comparing this to other programming   languages requires a bunch of line of code to do 
the exact same thing the next step is to have some   prerequisites as we are accessing Bing we will 
need to set up an account and also to have a Bing   Maps key I'll link down below as well how you can 
follow along and get those alright if I open up   vs code here you can see our HTML page and also 
too I want to note for this project we are using   Kindle UI Kindle UI is a set of user interface 
components and tools that will will allow you   to build for both web and mobile applications 
and it's based on HTML CSS and JavaScript and   Kendo UI is also developed at progress also to 
one of the main features or really interesting   features about Kendo UI is its cross-platform 
compatibility it allows you to build apps that   work across different devices browsers including 
desktops laptops tablets smartphones you name it   alright so let's go back to the HTML page and 
you can see in the HTML file we are importing   grid.js so if we go to the grid.js file you will 
see there is a function here called create grid   and within that function we are calling the rest 
API then if we scroll down a bit further you can   see we are creating a grid format and displaying 
the columns on the grid component next up is let's   create a CLS file and what that will do is really 
enhance the employee application also a CLS file   is a source code file for abl class definitions 
it is a simple text file that can be opened in   any text editor you can see here this is the code 
that implements the rest API and let's go ahead   and add some Fields latitude longitude position 
but you can add more as well and as you can   see we are adding these fields to the temp table 
definition so that this data can be returned from   the application server next up let's go back into 
our HTML code and ensure that we have support for   Bing Maps so you can see here on line 23 we have 
added in support for Bing Maps next let's create a   map.js file and this map.js will do a call to the 
Bing Map control API now in map.js you can see we   have the function called getmap and this is where 
we will be creating an instance of the map object   so you can see we are creating map Microsoft dot 
maps map and then two passing in our credentials   then this code is calling load data on line 22. 
and this function here is calling the rest API as   you can see then in our for loop as you can see 
it is adding the location information for each   employee and then this location's array is passed 
into the add locations function Down Below on line   43 and in the add locations function you can 
see we are actually creating push pins for each   location next up we need to have a Handler for 
the on push event that when you click on a push   pin it will display the info box all right if we 
go back to take a look at the new version let's go   back to localhost and see the new API that we have 
enhanced we can see here it now includes latitude   it also includes longitude and position and if 
you inspect this page and go to your network   tab you can see that this data is being returned 
as a Json now with all the steps we've taken we   can simply access our demo HTML page to open your 
project now right click on the demo.html file and   then open it up in Microsoft Edge and there it is 
this is pretty cool if you ask me we were able to   make this in a matter of minutes you can see here 
now we have a Bing Map which really shows where   the employees are located and if you select one 
of these push pins it will show the name and the   title of the person okay we have completed our 
project this is pretty cool honestly is really   simple and the power that openedge brings is 
pretty incredible and for this example we were   using JavaScript but openedge integrates with 
several programming languages not just JavaScript   and also too it provides a wide range of platforms 
and services from database management application   integration Security Management reporting 
analytics you get the point it's really powerful   this is a platform that if you are developing 
independently you can use but also too that a   lot of businesses use so it's something that is 
really important if you are going to be applying   in the job market and you are looking for other 
platforms to learn I would definitely suggest   checking out openedge because it's something 
that will really help you stand out on your   resume there are thousands of mission critical 
applications written in abl in multiple Industries   such as manufacturing Healthcare travel finance 
and tons more these applications are waiting to   get extensions improvements and modernization 
and also to their users and customers need new   developers benedge has a free developer 
training and certification program I know   a lot of us like to continue to upskill and gain 
more certifications to continue to grow our career   so I really wanted to share with you about this 
this training will help you as a developer become   certified in open Edge coding an openedge doesn't 
have to be complicated also too coding skills from   other languages are transferable to abl I linked 
it down below so make sure to go check it out   and once you have finished the training and are 
ready to jump start your career openedge even has   a LinkedIn group that helps connect job seeking 
developers with businesses that are specifically   looking for open Edge developers let me know what 
we should build next I wonder if we could like   add on to this to track the employees as they 
move around where's that creepy that's creepy   that's creepy tip okay hit the Subscribe button 
I'll see you all soon thanks everyone [Music]
