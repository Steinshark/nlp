Paul he hasn't hatched yet the elements in your password must have the atomic number that adds up to 200 welcome to Costco I don't even know what that means the elements in your password so s okay so s is one VII is a why is VII and V what are those you have S and BR yeah but what is VI what is v v and I are elements fudge well that makes it hard VI is six okay VI let's see okay hold on hold on uh yes V oh I know that it adds to 35 vi6 what is I iodine all right so what is a what is V VI atomic number VI atomic number is 23 okay so we got a 23 we got a 23 we we're doing this we got this we got a 23 what is iodines right is I iodine I atomic number 53 okay we're looking good we're looking good we're looking good we're looking good uh what's next we got uh s Atomic num 16 okay we're looking good and then we also had BR uh BR uh atomic number is 35 bromine give me that bromine uh did you say 35 okay what else let me make sure I got everything done I got those two those two those two oh I also got just V don't forget just V uh V Atomic numers 23 okay fantastic plus 23 okay so we need a 50 what's a 50 element with atomic number 50 sin tin Rin Tin Tin Rin Tin D nuts doesn't that add up to 200 if you I think you counted V twice oh is oh is it VI I I okay I guess we don't know is it so this is a good question here I'm going to put a little X right here oh yeah oh that's an X we can't put an X right there let's put a y let's put a uh oh we can't we need a seven dang it we need a seven okay um uh there is no VI element are you sure atomic number V VI okay VI is not one okay so it is V so we're doing V twice okay so okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so that means we need atomic number V I must have had that confused which is 23 all right so we have 123 we should have two 23s right so we have two 23s good we have two 23s but we need two iodines right we need two iodines or whatever eyes are I'm calling them iodines I don't know what those are I forget what
