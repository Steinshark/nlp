five reasons I hate my Tesla Model 3 [Music] what's up Jim nation welcome back to just jamming with Jason yellow jammers on your jam master sorry for the shaky camera goodbye I could buy a tripod yeah I mean I could buy a tripod but I just dropped 5 G's on this camera I didn't buy I didn't buy a microphone whatever listen Tesla here's the problem with my Tesla it's too quiet as a car vlogger most of the stuff that comes out of my mouth is pretty useless really I'm just ripping around in best cars open you don't realize how much cash these videos pad my pockets with now with a loud exhaust you all hear what I'm blabbering on about so it really doesn't make any difference what I say but in an electric car you hear everything everything I say which means I actually have to think and thinking's hard ok flat like for example the title of this video is 5 reasons I hate my Tesla Model 3 but if I hate it so much well why the did I buy it that's a question for you that's some serious debts that's thinking now we're gonna move on to reason number two and don't worry I'm not gonna tell you to like the video subscribe I'm way cooler than those other guys anyways ring that Bell we're jammin [Music] as a professional mechanic for the past 948 years I obviously stay up to date with all of the latest technology so let me tell you the truth this car right here sucks because the maintenance on this car right here sucks so hear me out there's no exhaust no fuel pump no spark plugs no alternator no nothing what the heck am I supposed to what back am I supposed to spend all this cash on that I'm not putting into car maintenance now I'm not needing it all right you still got to change the oil now I called Tesla and they try to convince me that you don't need this stuff they were like nah dude bunch of idiots I'm not falling for that let me be clear every engine needs oil every every engine needs oil now I never drain it because I haven't found a drain plug but that's not gonna stop me from dumping liquid pterodactyls all over my ride see you next time hola todos Fernando Alonso here look everyone knows honda makes the best engines my apologies I will not continue to try a Spanish English accent pero el habla espanol back to character look I'm just trying to have a relaxing season and enjoy some time out in the Sun they pay me 40 million dollars to get 12th place race car driving is stressful watching a race however is quite relaxing these electric cars and their electric motors they always work there's no gamble they don't break down and if they don't break down then there's no relaxing that means no tea time for Alonso it's not actually tea in here electric cars are too fast anyways I hear that thing's faster than a Ferrari four five eight around the track and faster than a Ferrari f50 to sixty miles an hour all with less power and a thousand extra pounds it's only saving grace is that it overheats after a couple laps and that means more tea time [Music] it's not to safety Sam here you may hear Tesla talking about the model 3 being the safest car out there and that's important and that's good great even heck it's why I bought this car but what about the rear seats you see there's no manual door release like there is in the front seats but that's fine right like there could never be a scenario where you need to manually get out of the rear seats like it's not like there could be a crash where you know the front right side of the car is hit and then it smashes the car on to the other side and then you know power is killed and then you're trapped in the back and you want to get out but there's no manual door okay so I guess like maybe in that or if you were trapped in a flood like maybe it'd be nice for there to be a man there's probably a whole bunch of scenarios in which would be nice to have a rear door release okay well this one wasn't very funny truthers I'm sorry well that's another episode of safety I would say I guess it's not safe to assume anymore it's like unsafe with salmon that kind of kills the whole [Music] it takes me nine hours to get to work and that's just one way seven hundred miles and it's minus nine hundred degrees outside and you're thinking hey maybe you should live within like I don't know 200 miles of your job or maybe you should live on the North Pole but that's not what I want the range sucks on the model 3 the EPA rates this for 310 miles my ass 2,000 on the other hand is rated for 264 miles you do the math which would you rather have 310 or 264 yeah probably the Tesla it's okay to move on there's lots of great content out there protip cars are not worth getting angry over be happy be kind I love you guys thanks for watching jam master out [Music]
