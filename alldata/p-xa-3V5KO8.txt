So today's video I want to talk about a subset of problems in maths called orchard problems. Which are not really to do with trees, but it's kind of helpful to think about trees - so you can think of apple trees or you can think about a forest. Fruit trees, they're quite often planted in deliberate plantation ways, so in lines. Have you ever seen- if you're driving down a road and there's a huge vineyard, you get this weird effect when you see somet- that you see - you look down the vineyard and you see just a line of trees and then suddenly you move a bit and you see that this stretches on forever. And as you move you get this, like, coming in and out of phase and it's quite a nice effect. Actually there's a lot of maths to ask about these things, like which trees can you see at any one point? And which trees can you not see? And can you see outwith the orchard or are there trees in the way? And does it matter where you stand? And that's the sort of thing that often gets described as orchard problems. And the one I want to show you; it's a simple one with a surprisingly unexpected answer. Imagine you're standing at the edge of an infinite forest, or an orchard. This is a mathematical one so the trees are thin; and, and all the trees are on coordinate points. So if you imagine a coordinate grid, they call this lattice points in the trade, the points with integer coordinates. So (1,1), (1,2). And I'm just gonna put loads of trees on this because this is gonna be where we're gonna play for a while. We're gonna play in the orchard for a bit. Let's start, as in all good mathematical models, by keeping it simple and later on we can upgrade that. But so the simplest way
is to assume that they're mathematically thin, they're points. Which is obviously not what real trees do, but we'll ask questions about that before we upgrade the model to be more realistic. 
- (Brady: Doesn't that mean we) (wouldn't be able to see them?) Well kind of but if you look directly 
at it there is a tree there. And actually that's what I want to start asking about, which trees can you see? So I'm gonna imagine that for the sake of the rest of this argument we're gonna stand at the origin. And I could have done all the trees going over here and down here, but we'll just work with this quadrant and you can extend it in your own mind if you wish. And the real question is, if all these trees are out there and they carry on forever, this is an infinite forest so it doesn't end in those directions; there are a lot of trees I'm gonna just put that out there. There's possibly some level of infinity number of trees. And I think you can see some of them, although your caveat is noted that mathematically thin things are gonna be harder to see than real trees. But if I- for example if I stand at this point and I look directly 45 degrees into the forest I can see that tree. Like, if I get it right I can see that tree. Obviously if it's thin maybe it's harder to see; but I also can't see the trees behind it because they're directly in line. So there are some obvious questions which are not interesting yet, but about visibility. And so a lot of these problems are also called visibility problems or lattice problems; I like the more poetic orchard problems. Here's the question, and I'm gonna ask you this 
Brady: if you're standing at this corner I'm gonna claim that you can see some trees. For example, well you can see that tree - if you look in the right direction. You can also see that tree, if you look along with that direction. And you would then hide that tree and that tree behind it. So some directions you look you can see trees, and I hope you agree with that. Is there any direction, Brady, that you could look standing here into the forest and not see a tree eventually? And I'm interested in your intuition about this. (Brady: My intuition is...no)
- Because eventually if you go far enough you will hit one. Even if you like carve out to miss the first few of them, it goes on forever. 
Now I have the same intuition about that - The answer is not as simple as that. The other standard answers to this question are you look up, no trees up there - which is great, it's hilarious. But if you look along the axes there are trees on there as well. So I think it's obvious, I'm gonna claim it obvious, that you can see some trees. Is it all trees or are there gaps? And where are the gaps if there any? And that's that's what we're gonna play with because it's it's surprisingly easy to answer. So the first thing I'd to point out is that I know which tree I can see based on what angle I look on the line. Actually, the angle is not so important as the gradient. So if you're standing here and you look along an angle of 45 degrees there then you will see this tree and that's got a coordinate of (1,1). Now actually the 45 degrees is pretty intuitive but it's also a gradient of 1; and just to remind you about a gradient it's like 
how far along you go- for how far up you go for every one along. Rise over run is the gradient - this has got a gradient of 1 for every one along you go one up. And this line here; I'm less worried about what angle it has - I could work it out but I need some trigonometry - but I can tell you the gradient of that line, the gradient here, equals 2. And it's hit the tree at (1,2). So I'm gonna claim that if I know I'm gonna hit a tree I can probably calculate the gradient of the line I hit. So if I picked this point he- is that gonna be a good one?
Well that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; and 2 up - so it's the point (5,2). And actually I can work out which line will hit it. Because it's got to go to there and it will carry on, but because I've got a line and I've got some
distances I can work out the gradient of this one is the rise over the run, which is gonna be 2/5. What's lovely is that I now know which lines will hit which trees. And if I find a tree I've hit I also know the gradient of the line. I'm now wondering if your intuition has been adjusted from when I first asked - you said you wouldn't hit- you'd always hit a tree eventually, right? You worried that you wouldn't? 
- (Brady: Well if we can make a) (gradient out of- that's not 
made out of integers, ) (like pi-)
- Pi is one of those massively annoying numbers that turns up everywhere you don't expect, but there's just one example of a number now which would do what you've just claimed to, it's not built of integers or ratios of integers. And this is where they get the word rational, because of that ratio of integers. So ratio-nal would be better pronunciation except no one uses that. So these are all rational numbers, if I look along a rational gradient I will hit a tree. So if you looked along a line of gradient - you said pi? Well pi is close to 3, so the gradient is roughly 3. It would go-
- (Brady: So I would just miss the 3-tree?) You just go above it. So it's three point one ish so you kind of head up there, it would be something like this line. But it would miss that tree and it would 
go up here; and it's not obvious to me where it would go next, or in fact whether it would hit a tree. Unless I know something about pi, which you've kind of mentioned that it is irrational, it's not a ratio. Now if it was a ratio it would hit a tree. Since it's not a ratio it can't hit a tree. 
- (Brady: So it's gonna just) (miss the 22 over 7 tree?)
- It's gonna be really close to it, because it's ridiculously close to 22 over 7, pi is really well approximated by that rational number - and there's some other really good ones too; but it is gonna miss because if it didn't miss it would be a rational number. Now there are lots of irrational numbers. They're pretty unintuitive things to exist but we can prove they exist, as James has done a lovely video about root two that we think that's the first one that anyone realised - ah, no ratio. And you can prove it, which means there are lines on this diagram that you could look along and you will never see a tree. And that's the first answer, you think, alright so there are some lines you won't ever see a tree despite this forest going on forever. And I kind of like that first result is like, oh I can see lots of trees, in fact infinitely many trees? But there are some lines I can look and never see a tree. So the real question is, if you pick a direction at random are you likely to see a tree or are you gonna miss? And this is where my mind starts sort of complaining about things, because the answer is to do with how many numbers there are. How many trees can you see? Well it's the same question as how many rational numbers are there? Everyone says infinitely many. It turns out that mathematicians have this nice way of talking about infinity of different sorts, so absolutely the rational numbers have a size of infinity which is- we call countable. James Grime, when he talks about it,
quite often calls them listable, which is a nice way to think about it. You can't actually count them 'cos you don't finish but you can list them in a way that means you've captured them all. So we really have to ask how many irrational numbers are there? Because if there's more maybe we're more likely to miss a tree. Which is then, we could ask questions about can you count the irrationals? And again if you go and look into the study of infinity, look up work by Georg Cantor - or a nice video by James Grime on an amazing maths YouTube channel. He explains to you why the irrational numbers are uncountable, or unlistable, which means there are infinitely many more irrational numbers than rational numbers. Which means, if you pick a direction at random in this forest you probably miss all the trees. In fact, not even probably - probability 0 that you'll hit a tree. You are 100% gonna always miss the trees. Which means if you stand on the corner, mathematically you can't see any trees because every 
direction you look there are no trees. Except you can see some, because we've picked out some but there would be infinitely many more that you can never see, or lines which never hit a tree. 
- (Brady: So if these trees) (are sort of super super-thin,) (well they're point thin-)
- Yeah (and I'm standing) (in the middle of the forest I'm gonna be) (rained with light not shade?)
- Yeah. It's all gaps. And this is completely irrational, to sort of have a horrifying pun, these irrational numbers they're so densely populated compared to the rationals that everywhere you look you're likely to hit them and not these special rationals which are really rare in comparison. In fact so rare that they account for 0% of all the numbers. But it still messes with my head, that you can stand in a forest of infinite trees and not see any of them; which is where the mathematical model comes into question, like ok because they're infinitely thin you could say, upgrade the model, you could say well what if the trees are a little bit thick? Or maybe if you if you think about this as firing a laser beam in
different directions then you could, say what if my laser beam is a little bit thick? And it's very easy to start realising that eventually, when the thickness comes in, you do get trees blocking the way. And you go into a forest, all you can see is trees, which is different from what we just explained. But the question is how far can you see into the forest? And then suddenly we've got quite a real-life question of, like, well how far does this laser actually get before it gets blocked by tree? It'll on the thickness, it'll depend on maybe the size of the orchard. And so those questions become orchard problems and the the famous one is Polya's orchard problem, if you want to look it up. It's to do with how far can you see, or could you get out with the wood with your laser, depending on the size of the orchard? 
- (Brady: I'm guessing that if the) (trees are one millimeter thick, suddenly) (you would have zero gaps, on an 
infinite scale) On an infinite scale you are completely correct. That mathematically thin is the only reason you can see nothing, and as soon as there's any thickness you can't get out at all. But there are some other interesting thoughts; it's like on the infinite one, with the mathematical thin trees, you could ask instead about the lines in this forest you could ask about the points. So which points can you see? Which trees are visible in this forest? The ones all behind the (1,1) are invisible if you're standing at the corner. They're doomed to be never be seen by any line because they're blocked by this one. But that point is visible, but that one's not; so which points are? And maybe if you picked a point at random out of all of them, what are the chances you've picked a visible tree? Talking about picking random stuff from infinitely many things is dangerous mathematically. Actually what we're talking about is if you make it finite, like N and N, and then answer that question when it's finite and then let N head off to infinity. It turns out you still have a sensible answer. The the chance - I'm gonna tell you this - the chance of a visible tree, if you pick one at random - and this blows my tiny mind - is six over pi squared. Another instance of pi turning up the place you least expected. But this is because of something called the Riemann Zeta function, which I think there are other videos available about. And it's because of the fact that if you actually want a visible tree, what you need is the tree you've picked to have two numbers, the coordinates here, which are co-prime. Because if they weren't co-prime, if they had common factors, they'd be hidden by an earlier tree. So what we're actually 
asking is, like, the chance of picking a visible tree is actually an abstract mathematical question - pick two numbers at random, what are the chance they're
co-prime? The answer is the Riemann Zeta function, with s equals 2, look it up; and it turns out to be this thing. It's not obvious why that's the case, but the Riemann Zeta function is a treasure trove of non-obvious mathematical stories. 
- (Brady: So if I) (was allergic to apple trees, and
I wanted) (to walk out of this forest without going) (near one, what is the best line to) (walk along?)
- I'm gonna disappoint you first of all, you're gonna go near one. But maybe there's a line which is least near - it's still gonna be near I'm afraid. And maybe you could argue mathematically you're gonna get pretty damn close, but anyway the idea that there may be a line which is least near means that there's a most irrational number. And actually it is this line. For reason is I'm not gonna go into now, but there are some interesting familiarities about it. So here's my little computer screen of some some trees. This line is at a gradient of precisely one plus the square root of 5, all over 2. Which, if it's not familiar to you, you've probably heard it by different name, is called the golden ratio. It's roughly 1.618, obviously if I told you the full decimal we'll be here for longer than you want to watch a video. This golden ratio turns up in lots of places, and it is the line that dodges the most trees. It's not easy to show in this case but- 
- (Brady: Well, there are lots of lines) (that dodge all the trees?) In fact infinitely many, but this one 
seems to be furthest away, because we know something about the golden ratio which is that it's the least well approximated by a rational number. Which means, in this case, it's the line that's least near any tree. And one thing you can see nicely about this is, if you imagine this line in the middle is the the golden ratio gradient, and you imagine it was an elastic band going off to infinity and you pulled this end along; it would catch on these trees. And if you pulled it up it would catch on some other trees. And it turns out that these numbers are familiar, this is the coordinate (1,1). This is the coordinate (1,2). This is the coordinate (2,3). The next one it hits is (3,5). Those numbers I'm reeling off are all from the Fibonacci sequence. In fact all the trees that this elastic band catches on are the numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. And that's another reason why the Fibonacci sequence captures, in its ratios, the golden ratio. It's a very intriguing number, which we should explore a bit more in another video.
