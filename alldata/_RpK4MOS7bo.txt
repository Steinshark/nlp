I love me a good controversy low level gang what is up welcome back if you're not already aware Linux kernel version 6.0 is hot off the presses fresh ready for you to use and more importantly Linus torvald and his latest correspondence with ZDNet said that in the Linux kernel version 6.1 rust will begin to appear in the Linux kernel now before you get mad or say anything about oh the level gang restation whatever I am not a full rust station I am not a rust missionary trying to push rust onto those that don't want it I am just a purveyor of code security and I understand how insecure C is and I want to make sure that we're going in the right directions I'm just exploring both options so don't shoot the messenger the question is how did this start why do people want rust to be in the kernel so bad and what's this mean for you in the future how did we get here in September of this year 2022 at the Linux plumbers conference it was demoed that people were actually able to create an nvme driver for Linux using Rus and it had performance comparable to that of C so the question would be if it's the same as C why would people replace a perfectly working language like C with rust the issue is that of safety Mark rasinovich who is the current CTO of Microsoft Azure and also the author of the windows just internals books considers C and C plus to be deprecated from a safety standpoint Microsoft reported this year that over 70 percent of security vulnerabilities so cves have been a result of memory corruption or memory mismanagement issues that are largely enabled by the lack of safety features of CNC plus plus markersinovich decided that he considers C plus plus deprecated and that new project should be started with rust this is kind of fitting with that Trend in the community where people are trying to replace Legacy code like C and C plus plus with a new language like rust but don't let that get you too excited because implementing rust into the Linux kernel is harder than its for a few reasons the first is that rust is a fairly immature language if you're not already aware rust is new-ish I don't know the exact age but C has been around since the 1970s it's much more mature and people are more familiar with using it there are features in Rust that are largely unstable that when later on in the kernel if they decide to lean on those features but the rust language removes them how do we keep those features from crashing the kernel a current idea is to create a standard based document that says that this version of rust is the Linux kernel rust another option is to create a rust compiler that is compatible with the gnu front end so that it acts just like a GNU compiler another issue with this being in the kernel is that of adherence if the subsystem owners and maintainers in the Linux kernel do not know rust are they able to just reject rust pull requests into the kernel I'm not sure how they're going to handle this anyway I want to hear your thoughts in the comments leave your thoughts down in the comment section below I'm not sure how I feel yet I think it's citing that a more safe language is entering Linux kernel but I do understand that there are some roadblocks or obstacles ahead as we go figure it out leave a comment hit subscribe and we'll see you guys in the next video take care
