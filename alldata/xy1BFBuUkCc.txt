ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the World Chess Championship 2023 the match that keeps on giving it's game number 13 out of a possible 14. it's six to six the world championship is supposed to be determined with seven and a half points out of 14 and if it's 7-7 they play a tiebreaker it's six six after 12. yesterday dingley Ren won from the depths of defeat against yanyupomnishi we got two games to decide who's gonna be the world champion and if we can't determine it we're gonna have some tie breaks and today's game did not disappoint Ed strike back with the white pieces after losing with a winning position with the black pieces this is tense I mean the pressure is astronomically High I don't even think you can use that adjective to describe that word Yan goes back to the true and tried E4 E5 the response from dig all right the momentum has shifted completely multiple times in this match three if not four times Jan has led by one ding has never LED Knight F3 Knight C6 Bishop B5 we have seen the Spanish every single time we've gotten to this position we have seen ding play one game of the Berlin and we now see ding return to exactly what he knows best Bishop A4 Knight F6 attacking the pawn in the center castles and ding playing this move order where he doesn't commit his d-pawn and as always for the millionth time if rookie won ding would play a setup where he tries to play the Marshall so Jan plays the move D3 which is an anti-marshall an anti-martial setup and after the move B5 Bishop B3 Pawn to D6 uh which we uh have seen um ding hirian has chosen a a variety of different setups he's chosen Pawn to A3 he has chosen pontu uh he he played a game where he played like C3 A4 four and so on well this game he plays C3 castles and now not the move A4 and also not even A4 now I mean this is yet another way that white can play just sort of poking at the queen side Jan plays the move C3 and then he plays H3 now this is interesting why is this interesting well like I've been telling you all rookie one would be met like this and then the traditional Spanish is C3 D6 H3 and then D4 like Bishop B7 D4 okay now the position after H3 looks extremely similar to the position in the game but look at the difference H3 so the pawn is there instead of The Rook being there to be honest they set up chosen in the game Bayan makes less sense is it bad or losing no it's just a different way to play the point is White's entire setup with C3 is to play D4 in one move but he already played D3 so why would he play D3 and then D4 and in chess that is really how it works I mean if you've already committed a pawn why are you playing the setup that is supposed to play the move there should have just played rookie one but he couldn't play rookie one why could he not play the rookie one setup because ding wouldn't play D6 because ding would Play The Marshall Gambit so there's a lot of little things here if Jan plays the way it's supposed to be played diggly red is going to play his secret Ultra powerful weapon the martial if D if if nepo plays it the way he plays it in the game well he gets a slightly different setup and maybe one that's not as as challenging ding develops his bishop and now Yan plays an even more dank move he doesn't play the A4 plan he doesn't play rookie 1 and then try to play D4 he doesn't play Knight bd2 he plays a move in this position that according to my database I mean y'all might have a better database than me this move has not been played by anybody good all right like one two thousand Raider player played it and yes a 2000 playing something 2000 is a very good ELO but if you're looking for inspiration in an opening database as a 27.95 fide rated player chances are the move the 2000 played is not what you're looking for Bishop E3 which on the surface there is nothing wrong with the move Bishop to E3 he's just developing a bishop but the move itself doesn't make sense in the traditional setting of The rui all right and my food is outside hello yeah just leave it at the door please thank you so much it was supposed to come 20 minutes in the future but I'm not complaining it's just gonna sit outside and get cold I'm not gonna go get it you think I'm gonna go get it what are you crazy no the recap is everything if somebody's I mean you know we got package thiefs in New York just leave it there it's fine Bishop to E3 doesn't make sense in in the traditional sense of the Lopez because if anything the bishop likes to go there and second of all you know your plan Pawn to D4 now you don't get the Rook here but it's fine it's just equal all right it's just equal and clearly by Young's time spend he knows what he's doing Knight A5 typical move C5 typical move now we have a very very tense position uh black would like to create some counter play with these Pawn breaks white would like to open up the center and maybe counter attack on the queen side and as always maybe you don't know this but now you do after studying all of the intricacies of the rui Lopez in this match white also might like to create an attack over here Knight bd2 now this position has been reached in the database no times at the high level uh because the white Bishop doesn't really belong in the E3 square but as you can see white is trying to play D4 without playing rookie one which is interesting all right because now he's gonna cover that two times so we have to move rookie eight and now the move d4 is actually really really difficult to land because uh after CD4 CD4 ed4 let's say white takes like this black is going to bring the Knight back where do you put the bishop because I got to do this for you you put the bishop there I got B4 I got D5 stuff you take this a bishop is not really an asset I'm going to capture it uh the Mover kid is very nice and actually from According to the database and you'll notice that Ding spent seven minutes on that move uh according to the database white does not score very highly here I mean white is scoring like 38 I mean if black is scoring 62 in a line it means it's not very good so this opening is already a little bit a little bit weird but okay it's the Spanish I mean it's just equal with best play right so young plays A4 now you'll notice that in Young's preparation he is clearly in his prep it doesn't matter that it's 30 something percent uh Jan came prepared like I am trying to describe the fact that Jan not Jan is not playing a bad opening but he is playing an opening that uh is challenging for an advantage in a very unconventional fashion he's playing uh in a new way in an opening that's been tried and tested thousands of times uh and uh if you try to do something uniquely when it has been done already thousands of times successfully you are either uh going to come out as a genius or you'll blow up the kitchen or you'll spill paint all over the canvas right and it won't be although some people did that and they got very famous doing it but that's effectively what it is now here H6 uh H6 is almost always a useful move and it takes away anything going to G5 so this bishop is sort of stuck that Bishop's not going to get out anytime soon also ding is completely unafraid of the opening of the position over here uh the only thing that Jan can do here is play the move d4 so he does it now what I will say is interesting about H6 which ding spent six minutes on you will notice digplayed H6 which is a simple effortless improving pawn move that does not touch any piece clearly ding is completely happy with the placement of literally every piece why is he happy because the onus is on White in this position to come up with an idea why is the onus on white because well that's I mean white goes first so white leads the dance uh also you know white is kind of the one with the pawn break black doesn't like Black's not gonna go B4 that's not a good move it surrenders way too much control of the queen side black is also not going to go C4 because then white will go D4 and be extremely happy uh so black is not really the one calling the Sean's black is sort of like all right come and get me D4 now again the weird thing is Jan spent 14 minutes but why did he spend 14 minutes on that move if that's the idea of the opening could Jan have prepared it could he have played like a b and then D4 potentially the computer said maybe a b and D4 Yan plays D4 and as you can see we have a fate we have a standoff I mean absolutely everybody is staring at everything in a moment uh not to mention these pawns are beefing over here I mean you got you got like a like a line fight in hockey a five on five line fight it's a very famous fight was it Senators Sabers when the goalies fought oh I love that there's also my favorite uh hockey highlight to watch on YouTube is Flyers Penguins there was a series some years ago in the playoffs round one or two and they fought the whole series and I remember that series because the Penguins were winning like babies like 2-1 baby scores and the Flyers were winning like seven nothing just obliterating them that was very fun that was when Claude Giroux I think was like coming into his element anyway Good Times Ponte Z4 Pawn takes D4 and ding plays the move Knight C4 inviting a trade of a knight uh and the position is is very tense Jan obliges after nine minutes he didn't have to take he could have played something like Queen E2 but then again ding is gonna grab the bishop because it's just a nice little benefit to his position to do that Jan would either take with the queen or even the pawn this is a horrible structure but actually the openf file does make for a little bit of a a juicy thing here you could put something on C4 and put some pressure um Knight C4 bc4 and after spending six minutes Yan plays F3 and this is where a catastrophic moment occurs in game 13. defends his Center Pawn by playing F3 I mean how else was he gonna defend it if he played Queen F3 he would be walking directly into a pin I don't like that either so he plays F3 but now he is destabilizing his position a little bit and ding plays the best move Bishop f8 and ding has three pieces staring at the center the move D5 is coming defending this teaming up with everything hitting this reopening the diagonal of the bishop dingley Wren is in the driver's seat with the black pieces for the first time in the entire match it took him until his final game with black clearly Jana's rattled alright choosing a little bit of a sideline in the opening and now Jan has to step out of the way because if he doesn't because if he waits one more move a D5 is borderline completely winning for black uh so Bishop F2 steps out of the way of The Rook But Here Comes Pawn to D5 and dingly ren is better dingley Ren has a big Advantage all right Jan takes on D5 ding recaptures with the Knight and he's ready to play Knight E3 if you spend one more move Knight F4 Knight E3 this Knight Parks itself outside of the airport terminal waiting for people to arrive 90 2 is a problem Bishop C5 is a problem Bishop is a problem Knight is a problem Rook up and over is a problem a queen G5 and mate is a problem everything is a problem Jimmy Butler is a problem for the Milwaukee bugs by the way yo Knicks are gonna cook Miami by the way I mean I'm just saying Nick's getting to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics I mean what is this the mid 20th century of basketball this is incredible Spa just I mean I I the Knicks are really good Mitchell Robinson oh my goodness he made Jared Allen anyway Knight takes D5 white has to prevent all of this bishop to E4 and ding has his biggest moment in the game it's it's a relatively simple situation there is a pin on the night so Rook B8 is probably the right antidote now white can take and then maybe Queen D5 and black is convincingly better black is just better much better in fact like minus one of Advantage with long-term pressure on White's position and the bishop pair and a completely effortless Advantage Bishop to E4 you can play Rook B8 you don't want to play Rook B8 play Queen F6 you don't want to play that play Queen G5 defending this the point is white has to take if white doesn't take Knight F4 is is game over so ding has a massive opportunity and he plays rookie five he spends 20 minutes and plays rookie five I don't hate this move all right but rookie five is creating a little bit of a Tetris piece on the side our ding's idea was obviously Bishop takes D5 Rook D5 that is clearly his idea but what is the long-term objective right because all the moves that I pointed out Rook ba Queen F6 Queen G5 black all of those moves set up a night move for the most part we have six sets of rook d8 and then a night move this does not set up a night move other moves Queen F6 Queen G5 Rook B8 Rook B8 all demanded Bishop D5 the problem with things move is Yan can make another move he doesn't need to take the Knight on D5 he doesn't need to take on the Knight on D5 period because after Rook C8 he can just go here there was never a moment where ding enabled the movement of the night the problem with the bishop on e4 was not the pressure on the Knight it was the bishop you needed to guard the bishop to enable the movement of the Knight to F4 and because he waited a little too long Yan stops it now still ding has very good pressure here the move Queen E8 is the accurate move and actually pressures the pawn and the e-file and white really should consider going here because the longer that white weights black will play Rook d8 and set up a cannon and if white steps out of the way Knight B4 gallops into D3 and white is lost okay so instead of Queenie a ding plays Queen E7 it's not a bad move but it is Queen D4 now what was the difference between Queen E8 Queen D4 and queen E7 Queen D4 the difference was the fact and you're gonna see this in the game that uh first of all there is Knight E3 that is a major difference you can shove the knight in the way and then Bishop takes E4 the reason you cannot play Knight E3 with the queen there and the queen there is after this this bishop G3 uh the queen is standing in the way of the bishop that is a major major problem for black doesn't have enough room you needed the queen on E8 so that after Queen D4 Knight E3 and this entire same sequence Bishop G3 hits this bishop C5 so ding had to go here to keep the bishop open he needed to not block his own Bishop that is some giga dank stuff okay chess is a brutal game sometimes you just had to not close your own bishop and the point is that Queen D4 that tactic no longer works and after F5 again had the queen been there once again instant replay F5 Bishop G3 Bishop C5 is lights out ding needed to play Queen E8 and he would have had a massive Advantage but instead he went here and the problem is that after F5 he doesn't get to pin the queen he missed this idea and he goes for a rook sacrifice instead getting an end game where he has a bishop and a pawn for a rook the problem is now Jana's may be back in the driver's seat with Rook F5 I mean these guys are going back and forth this entire match Rook D1 Knight B4 ding is gonna plant the horse here and start a family with the two pawns the horsey is gonna raise horse babies all right what what are horse babies what what is the word for baby horse hold on what is the word for baby horse oh I don't okay my favorite thing is just a murder of crows that's crows yep anyway Bishop C5 check Bishop C6 and Jan trades the Rooks and now Jan is better all right Bishop D5 and you know things gotta things ding is uh chilling ding chilling if you will you know uh in the center of the board here but unfortunately Knight C3 Knight D3 uh hits the bishop with the Rook is counter-attacked black starts bringing his King and Jan actually could have played Knight E2 and had a pretty substantial Edge Bishop D5 would have been necessary and Yan could have played this end game and I got news for you if Magnus Carlson was sitting in this position in a world championship match right here he would not play what just happened what happens in this game is rookie 2 and the players make a draw they make a draw they repeat moves game 13 is a draw it's six and a half six and a half the difference is that Magnus Carlson in this position would have found 92 Knight F4 Bishop D5 has to defend and only white is playing for a win here because a rook is just better than a bishop it just is and the last piece is on the board the better for the Rook but game 13 ends in a draw Yan doesn't play 92 Knight F4 it almost feels like he can breathe a sigh of relief but ladies and gentlemen this comes down to the final game or the tie break but the next person to win wins it all like how in basketball when you're down and you say next Point wins that is exactly what it will come down to this is the first world championship to go the distance in 20 years the First World Chess Championship to go the full length of the allotted games in 20 years since leko kramnik 2004. I will see you all for game number 14 in two days April 28th is a rest day April 29th we might Crown a new classical World chess champion get out of here
