while back I asked you for code roast submissions so today it's time for another code roast co wait a minute when I was looking through your submissions I noticed something the code you've been sending in lately has been of much higher quality than before what is going on let me show you what I mean I'm in my Discord server now by the way if you haven't joined my Discord yet it's totally free it's a really great Community you can join VD invite below now here is the section where people post code roast requests and there's like a bunch of them but let's take a look at a few of them for example this one this is a payroll management system but if I look at the code so we have a test folder so you actually wrote test that actually makes sense you're using py test it's very clean you're using fixtures which is awesome or if you look at the source code so then let's say I'm going here to services so everything is neatly organizing files there is constants uppercase constants at the top of the file which is great you use a couple of data classes keep things pretty simple pretty small focused classes I mean some of these methods are maybe a bit long but I mean this is not really an issue right it's this is perfectly fine code or here an example of another file where you use a property where it makes sense you use type annotations this is great code there's nothing else to say about it or here I have another one of your submissions which is about the Railway system which we all love if you're Dutch you know what I mean but then if you look at the code it actually also looks really good you're using a pip project file to manage your project which is great you generate documentation you also have unit test that also look really good I mean you're even using more advanced testing tools like hypothesis what's not to like about that but also if you look at the code well here's a file that defines a simple API server using fast API so you have grouped the settings for creating the actual app into an get app function that gets a limiter and settings it's great using dependency injection and then you're using the limiter here as decorator and then you have your endpoints which is lovely you put things into Trix sub block so that you can handle specific errors that's awesome or if you take a look at this file you're using an abstraction with a protocol class to Define what a printer should be and then you supply specific implementations of that printer that's awesome that's really what code should look like so the question is how am I supposed to bash your code if you're writing code that's this great it's my work is done there's nothing left for me to do so to me that's pretty clear like if I compare these type of submissions with the code you submitted like a year ago even the quality has gone up so much so this got me wondering is this just a fluke and then in a few months you're going to send in that nice tasty crappy code again for me to bash or are we really having an impact and are people actually getting better and this is what I wanted to find out so I posted a survey a couple of weeks ago trying to figure out what your thoughts were about this and I want to show you some of the results because it's quite interesting so 230 of you filled in the survey thank you so much for helping me with this and here are the results so the first question that I ask is on what level you agreed with some statements that help me understand how you improved your skills and this ranged from strongly disagree to strongly agree and though most of these things are pretty much in blue which is really good you can see that according to you the channel help you improve your Python Programming skills and your software design skills that's a pretty clear indication of that and that also makes sense because most of my content has been about these two topics right then we have better understand software testing and software architecture so those are a bit lower and that also makes sense because I don't post lots and lots of content about software testing on the channel and also not about software architecture even even though I did some videos about that so it's pretty normal that these are a bit lower and then overall become a better software developer in general I wanted to add this statement to kind of get an overall feeling of what you thought of how your skill improved so that's all pretty positive and to be clear I didn't ask these questions to Pat myself on the back or something I really wanted to know is what we're doing with iron codes having a positive impact that's the most important thing right and then that's also going to help me understand where I should put in more work and what I should improve in order to help you even better but this is already something that I'm really happy with and it does show that I do need to do some work on content related to software testing and software architecture in particular software testing and this is a hard one actually because I notice that whenever I post some content on software testing it gets less views so let's say the YouTube algorithm is less friendly to me when I post software testing content but I still think it's important for you to know about it so I'm going to try to find a way to do more of this this next year the next question I asked is how you interact with us is that via YouTube videos LinkedIn other social media Discord Etc and uh I wanted to get an understanding of where you were and how much overlap there is between the audiences on the different platforms now obviously everybody indicated that you watch the Youtube videos because that's also where I posted the survey so it would be weird if you didn't watch any of the YouTube videos uh but then if you look at the other areas where you interact with me so there is um quite a few of you who are subscribed to the Weekly Newsletter if you're not subscribed yet by the way there's a link in the bottom uh it's totally free there's lots of extra articles and content that I post weekly in my newsletter section and then there's a couple of other plac as well like these two are also quite popular so the uh that's the online courses that some of you bought thank you so much that really helps support the channel uh then we have the free Discord server that you're a member of which is also really great so these are like the top let's say community surrounding the YouTube channel and then we have the social so quite a few of you are on LinkedIn though notably less than the newsletter and the Discord server and even less on other social media like Facebook and Instagram and that also makes sense I'm not really that active on any other social media LinkedIn I'm doing quite a bit because there I find it suits well with the kind of content that I publish on the YouTube channel since LinkedIn is more you know business focused and there's quite a few software Engineers on there uh Facebook Instagram yeah I don't know I'm I'm not really a fan of those platforms either I'm I'm not really actively involved in those platforms um neither am I very much involved on Twitter now X also due to all the recent changes I feel like the platform is not really for me anymore but overall this gives a pretty nice idea of where you are on which platforms you are most active there's also a couple of platforms that I didn't really include it since I'm not that active on that like Reddit for example now before I talk about new types of content that I want to do in 2024 I just want to say I find it really cool that it seems like you think we're having a positive impact and I also see it from the code roast submissions and in general in the discussions on the Discord server that are getting pretty in depth and pretty interesting so I think overall that's really nice to see that we're having such a positive impact and that we're helping so many people let me know in the comments do we share this feeling what is the most important thing that you've learned last year and what are the things that you would like to learn more about in the coming year let me know so next question is for next year 2024 what kind of content are you most interested in and I posted a couple of options here so one is more live streams and Q&A sessions another one is shorter videos and there I don't mean YouTube shorts of less than a minute I mean let's say shorter format videos of about four to 5 minutes talking about one specific concept then we have blog posts basically reading material related to the video topics then we have longer videos at least 1 hour of doing live coding or refactoring then Vlog Style videos kind of more behind the scen stuff of what's happening on the channel and what we're doing with the team and then the final type of content I added here was podcast on software design and development where I could interview senior developers CTO other important people from the software industry and the results I found also quite interesting so you can clearly see that there are some categories that you're just not very interested in uh one of them is live streams and Q&A sessions I actually did a few live streams this year also to experiments a bit with the idea and with the platform I did like them so I might do them in the future but uh it seems that's not what you're the most interesting in also something that you're not that interested in is more Vlog Style videos behind the scenes means kind of things which also makes sense to me in the end I mean we're an educational Channel and me posting Vlog Style videos or whatever is not really going to help you learn more so I totally get that that's not really why you're coming to the channel but the other content types you are all quite interested in the Lesser ones of those were the podcast and the blog post and the two content types that you're the most interested in is the shorter videos and the longer videos I guess you just want more videos so I can confirm that in the coming year I am going to do more videos actually my idea is that we go to a schedule of two videos per week instead of one video per week and we're already started preparing for this and for the time being that second video that we're going to add we're going to publish that probably in the beginning of the week and what we're going to do is a shorter video so my regular videos won't change I'll still have every Friday a longer video though this particular video might not be that long but typically will aim for videos between between 10 and 20 minutes diving a bit deeper into a topic taking a bit more time to explain things just like we're doing now but then we want to add a shorter form format of four to five minutes where we're really focusing on one single thing also with a code example in many cases and just going for that one single thing and explaining that in just a few minutes and I think that's going to be a nice addition to the channel so if you don't feel like you want to watch 20 minutes of me you can also take a 5 minute video and then have something that's a bit more focused and a bit more aimed at some specific thing that you want to learn about so shorter videos would definitely going to do those now the longer videos I've been thinking about how to do that and I'd like to hear your thoughts about this what kind of things would you like me to do here would that be refactoring of some existing Library would that just be watching me live doing some coding would that be a longer code roast what are the kinds of things that you'd like me to do let me know one thing that we're also going to do is blog so also the blog post were quite popular and we've already started publishing the first blog post we're going to do two of these posts per week sometimes they may be related to a video so we'll cover the same topic but in blog style so you can also read about it instead of watching a video might be faster in some cases but we're also going to publish new articles that are not related to a particular video and we might even do the other way around where we first write blog post but then I'll do a longer in-depth video covering the same topic on YouTube so lots of possibilities there but you can already read the blog post by going to RM codes.com SL blog and you'll already find a couple of interesting posts there to get you started the final thing I want to talk about is the podcast this is something we've been thinking about already for a while it's something that I personally am quite interested in doing and I'd love to do interviews and talking with people I think it's could be really like a lot of fun to do this I just want to make sure that we're not overextending ourselves in terms of the work that we do and the energy that we that we spend because we're now a whole team and we have lots and lots of things going on I mean even just doing an extra video per week that's like a huge amount of work that we have to take on and we have to make sure that all goes well and that we have everything under control but the podcast is definitely something that I'm seriously considering just have to think about the right form and the right shape for that so as as soon as I have an update on that I'll let you know now next to the new types of content that we're going to do in the coming year we also have a couple of updates related to the courses coming so there's the software architect mindset that's going to launch in January it's going to be available to everybody and we're also planning some bigger update to some of the existing courses like the software design and mindset I don't plan to launch more new courses this year maybe we'll do a smaller course but I doubt that because we're already focusing so much on making more free content for everybody and that's ultimately what I wanted to to do the most of but if you have ideas for courses that you'd like me to develop let me know in the comments below so there were a few more questions in the survey one was what would you like me to do more of next year so if you look at the responses you see things like code roasts python is quite popular More Design patterns design principles basically more of what we've been doing already and also you see quite a few of you asked for projects code that has that's related to real world applications so that's of course something that I've always try to focus on not doing animal class hierarchies but actually using examples that are close to what production code would actually look like so definitely going to continue that and with the extra videos that we're going to do the extra weekly videos we're going to also make sure that that follows that same idea of the regular videos what would you like me to do less of next year so so videos about AI was quite popular AI hype I think it's pretty clear you want less videos about AI even though I think AI is going to impact us a lot I'm not going to do as many videos about AI as I did last year I think I also got myself kind of from a hype train was really excited about it so I wanted to do a bunch of videos about it doesn't mean that I will never do any AI related content anymore because actually some of you in question for also asked for more AI focused content so there are some let's say conflict there that I'm not able to solve right I can't do more and less at the same time so I will still do some AI content on the channel I'm not going to stop doing that and specifically I think I'm going to focus it on learn tail because that's the platform we're developing for you and that's also a good use case of AI and how to apply it practically so I want to show more things related to learn till in this year but that's not going to be a weekly reoccurring topic on the channel so today was not a roast video slightly different I hope you also still enjoyed this one I really like learning more about the community seeing where we can improve things what we should do and really helps me improve the content that I make so thank you so much for filling in this survey and for sharing your thoughts with us it's really helpful now I am going to do an actual code roast video very soon it was a really fun one I'm sure you're going to like it if you already want to get like in a mood for code roast videos you could and watch this one which is the previous one that I did thank you so much for watching and see you soon
