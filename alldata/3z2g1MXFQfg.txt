all right people special delivery by the way the daily WTF has been my favorite that I hope everybody knows J diesel came from the daily WTF okay this is going to be a good article I just can feel it special delivery Brad's phone rang with The Telltale tone of an inner office call yeah he briskly blurted out as he picked up the phone what you need that was actually his nice way of answering the phone as the senior Trader at ex exore one of the world's Lar energy traded companies Brad didn't need to impress anyone and in his mind displaying anything less than a vicious hubris would be a sign of weakness let's go Brad let's go Brad Brad vicious hubis let's go Tom the genius the receptionist nervously answered there's a a delivery for you sir they Brad scoffed cut her off just go sign for it then is that really that hard to do can you do that can't you well well sir the receptionist winced they're asking for more instructions and we need to pay warfet charges they said youd know I'm at a loss fine Brad scouted I guess I have to do everything around here he slammed down the phone and marched out of his corner office despite excess course location the old docs District their office was one of the most Posh in the city on the end of expensive former Warehouse sat the executive suites which had a tremendous view of the city skyline the other end where Brad was headed towards was the reception which overlooked its own private bay on the river that's pretty Posh okay I'm here he said angrily announced once he stepped foot into the lobby so let's do this what do I need to do Brad stopped mid-sentence his eyes were immediately drawn through the floor to ceiling windows and onto the River Bay that exor's building overlooked there was an absolutely gigantic barge nay an armada of tightly connected barges overfilled with enormous piles of coal that was attempted to dock in front of the building what the f F you must be Brad a cheer voice a cheerful voice jumped in Brad's eyes shifted toward the scruffy fellow wearing some sort of workman's uniform who was sitting in one of the reception chairs now first and foremost how in the Sam Hill are we supposed to Moore this boat I count two cleats but we were sure as heck we can't hitch these and shoot do you even have a bulk birth for once Brad was speechless he had absolutely no idea who that man was and he could hardly understand a word he said plus there was a gargantuan vessel that was slowly moving towards the building uh he stuttered wait Are you delivering coal to us well yeah 28,000 tons of good old black gold the Workman sarcastically furrowed his brow adding I mean we did get the right address har har this is exe and this is Pier 53 and are you Brad the fellow who ordered it right it was that moment that Brad's Palm almost immediately made contact with his forehead he realized that something must have gone aai instead of virtually trading 28 tons of coal Brad had somehow ended up with 28 tons of real coal Brad flew too close to the sun too close to the sun he flew too close to the Black Gold how much is 28 tons of coal I don't know I have never bought coal to tell you the honest truth I don't even know how to buy one ton of coal let alone 28 of them okay 28,000 tons two 28 million lbs of coal if you've ever watched Trading Places the 1983 classic starring Edie Murphy and Dan akroy by the way Trading Places is one of my favorite videos of all time it's it Eddie Murphy does such a good job and so does Dan akroy uh then you're probably at least familiar with commodities Market at a basic level Commodities such as gold wool and soybeans are sold by producers and eventually delivered to buyers but Billy Ray Valentine didn't strike it rich and bankrupt the Duke Brothers by hauling around Frozen concentrated orange juice he actually did an Insider deal trading and Bamboozled the Duke Brothers instead they worked the commodities Market by buying and selling fcj future contracts actually that's really the only way to trade in Commodities okay that means you're trading the Futures effectively what is the future price of these things will we be able to produce a lot of it or a little of it if you produce a little of it and there's high demand then the value of it goes way up so if you bought future contracts then you're going to do really well if you bought not the right kind you're going to do really bad uh 28 tons cost 4 million dang okay that's a lot a Futures Contract is pretty straightforward you agree to buy X units of commodity at n per unit at some fixed future date while it might seem a bit strange for an individual to agree to buy 20 tons of pork bellies in April for 3$ 34,42 even if he really loves bacon the idea is to sell the 2 be delivered pork bellies long before April and sell them for more than 34,000 just about every conceivable commodity is bought and sold in this manner long before the commodity is even produced the whole point of all this trading is to shift the risk and rewards of fluctuating commodity prices from producers farmers and miners to the Traders I don't know how that shifts the risks and rewards it doesn't make any sense to me but this does happen this is real okay we legitimately trade the future price of frozen orange juice concentrate it's basically just gambling is it I don't even know yall pay attention to this this uh Commerce happens on the CBOE the Chicago Board of exchange and it's much larger than the stock market I've heard about this that it's I've never done anything with it but I hear people make a lot of money in here and it sounds crazy I don't I don't even have any reason to understand how this stuff works of course because commodity Traders don't actually want to be stuck with tons and tons of pork bellies the whole series of middlemen from the Brokers to the exchanges to the Clearing Houses work hard to ensure that when you say I will buy 300 tons of pork bellies for four or 518,000 in May you don't actually buy 300 tons of pork bellies for 518,000 in May Brokers for example will set up round turn trades so that for each future contract purchase and offsetting contract can be sold to whoever actually wants to buy the goods The Exchange is automated trading systems have all sorts of rule engines to make sure that obvious errors like delivering truckloads of Commodities to a commercial Office Park don't slip through and finally processors at the Clearing House will double check transactions to make sure they weren't sent over in air all that said it's almost impossible for Traders to actually buy Commodities that they're buying well almost impossible and that my friends is where this Story begins The Perfect Storm at exe trading coal on only one exchange the WTF Stock Exchange the WTF stock exchange I like this Stock Exchange and they didn't trade coal very often as such when the WTF Stock Exchange upgraded its public facing web service-based API exor's internal trading system could no longer communicate with it with a couple pending coold trades this presented a bit of a problem oh my goodness this is so good fortunately exe had staff of crack programmers that were able to hack together a solution that worked with the WTF se's new API essentially the coder added a bit of XML to their trading request including the following snippet additional properties physical address value false notice anything off about that XML if you said value should be zero instead of false then you give yourself a pat on the back as it turns out wtfs only recognized ones and zeros to represent true and false and if the value was neither one nor zero it would simply default to one oops what I mean whoops now this normally wouldn't have been that big of a deal to ensure accurate transactions the WTF SE and just about all other exchanges send back a trade confirmation with all the original information encoded their XML that way both parties have to understand each other's data on exor's end everything looked hunky dory especially as a result of the following line bull physical delivery get node value physical delivery to lower equals true kudos to the developer for verifying the correct case yes that's true the two lower well done because some people capital T that true look at you python okay you keep struggling with for loops and capital T and F node values what the hell why why would you do that why is true capital T I hate you why is it a string true because we're talking about XML dog but a string can be infinitely more strings than simply true or false such as one or zero whoops o the problem is becoming so apparent this is why something like Proto Buffs or some required typed format just feels so good when you're playing with third party Services you're getting fand dangled by ones and TRS oof oof you know what I mean even a mistakenly confirmed incorrect trade shouldn't have been that big of a deal since the Clearing House would notice some pretty big problems with the trade you can't just call up FedEx and request a delivery of thousands upon thousands of tons of raw material to some office complex downtown Commodities can only be delivered to a fixed number of delivery points such as warehouses adjacent to train yards or ports oh no it's because it's a posh building in what used to be a delivery area of course since exe's offices were located on Pier 53 a recently redeveloped Warehouse District off the river it would have seemed like a logical place to accept a delivery of a whole ass bunch of coal especially to rules engines oops yes fortunately the commodity Futures Trading Market doesn't rely entirely on software there are back office Personnel on both sides of the transaction and veral places in the middle to make sure that Trader doesn't do something silly like accidentally click the physical delivery check box enter into round turn trades that create an instant net loss and so on so with everyone looking over transactions you think someone along the way would have noticed that trading giant exor asked for a physical delivery of million half dollars worth of coal actually someone probably did but because the trade came from Brad there was just no way it could have been made an error is physical delivery really just a checkbox it must be it's a true or false that sounds like a checkbox to me this is so good the best part about this is the fact that Brad was such an [ __ ] that people didn't want to correct Brad because he is so correct oh man this is so good as the senior Traer at exeo Brad made it very clear that no one not even his Holiness the pope shall question his trades after all Brad makes complex trading decisions that no one else could possibly comprehend sometimes he buys high and sells low sometimes he holds in a decline sometimes he refuses uses to sell at any price Brad works in mysterious ways and if he said do it then it better get done let's go let's go let's go man just imagine big Brad that you do all of these things just to feel like you're a champion and then what happens you get wrecked Brad's greater than Rick Brad is single-handedly greater than Rick early Christmas present now don't go telling me that this coal ain't yours the Workman said defensively sensing something was ay I mean if you don't want it that's your business but this here is your coal Mr Brad as much as Brad wanted to deny it he knew it was his and not only that but he had hotly confirmed reconfirmed and reconfirmed with exor's own back office processing team he had just assumed like he always did that the mouth breathing paper pushers couldn't read English mouth breathers as he played back the last thing he told one of the pre-processors about the coal order what part of my execute my [ __ ] trade don't you understand he wondered what he could possibly do with 56 million pounds of real coal I've never been put in that situation try to imagine for a moment how you would unload a mountain of coal worth a million and half dollar Craigslist has its limits after all as it turned out it was more difficult than Brad could ever imagined to sell real coal the Commodities Market really only deals in Futures and everyone who actually needs 28 tons of coal has bought it long in advance and besides who wants to buy coal from some guy named Brad there's Brad again selling coal who wants to buy coal from Brad eventually after paying exorbitant Waring shipping environmental docking unloading loading in multiple fee fees Brad was finally able to unload it for 20 cents on the dollar ever since the big purchase Brad has never been able to live down his mountain of coal every time he passed others in the hallway he knew that they knew about the coal and they knew that he knew that they knew no one really poked fun or laughed at him but it didn't matter Brad was no longer thought of as the senior Trader at exore instead he was the guy who accidentally bought all the coal one time I accidentally broke a production feature on a very specific very exciting release of some content on Netflix sure it only broke for like four people but I still broke it for those four people there was a while there I was known as the guy who broke it for the people waiting for the feature and the people that were waiting for the feature was like my boss and a couple other people it was only people who were waiting for it to happen live it broke it was a countdown billboard it was a the countdown billboard on Netflix okay the countdown it counted down to zero and then I accidentally created an infinite Loop they say four Loops are easy you know that's what they say 3 2 1 infinity okay sometimes you actually put an Infinity out there you know sometimes when you walk in you go to the penthouse and sometimes when you walk in you go to the ouse just happened to me my day for an ous filled with skill issues and regret and an email that I would eventually say send that would say I am sorry I screwed that one up sometimes you forget not to use sign integers sometimes you forget zero and division causes things that are very large numbers the spec wasn't clear enough it just clearly wasn't clear enough sometimes he index you with a float yeah it's true that's the worst he did oh no I did worse I've done a lot of stupid things at Netflix but that's just the one that reminds me of just the most flak I've received I one time had my boss tell me that I had to step away from the keyboard when I'm feeling upset that was like seven years ago 8 years ago I learned a good lesson that day don't send emails when you're upset okay don't send emails when you're upset you're going to say things that you're not happy about why did you make the autoplay feature okay I'm going to go over this one last time I made the autoplay feature for Netflix when you go to netflix.com you get hit with a trailer and it plays with the volume on now during the process there were nine cells okay nine AB cells nine AB cells nine separate experiences number eight I fought for okay I fought for number eight you know what number eight did number eight muted the trailer and did localized subtitles for you to be able to read the trailer it muted it for you because I like you said hm I don't think people would want volume on well guess what Jackass y'all loved the volume on you guys couldn't stop playing the show when volume was on and guess what it's not my fault that you did that I opened the door I made the door I drew the door and said here you go walk through the door and you guys said nah I'm going to take that other door the one with the volume on because you know what when you actually play the when you play the trailer and then there's actually that funny part I actually kind of like it yeah I'm going to go with that one that's the one I want to go with because really deep down inside of me I actually am the loser that likes the volume on but I'm going to complain about it and then I'm going to see a show that I like and then I'm actually going to watch it and it's going to be great but I'm going to complain about it on Twitter because I am a ke board Warrior get the hell out of the way the name is this video is going to be very difficult to edit there was a lot of stuff that happened during this aent
