ladies and gentlemen the Chess World has a new villain alternatively the Chess World has a new Hero whatever you want to call him his name is nbec Abdus sator and he is from usbekistan nbec has been at the top of the world rankings top 10 top 15 top 20 for several years now he's one of the upand cominging promising Junior players in fact nck is the second youngest person on planet Earth to win a World Chess Championship he did it several years ago in the world rapid which he won at the age of 17 youngest person to ever win any world championship is hoan who won the Women's World Championship at the age of 16 nck is a beast he is the USC tiger and over the last couple of weeks he won a tournament and became the fourth highest rated player in the world higher rated than dingly Ren the current world chess champion in this video I'm going to show you multiple ridiculous games that noer Beck has played multiple Queen sacrifices gangster moves left and right this dude is a problem and he is such a problem he is the first Junior to become High rated than Ali Resa fua Ali Resa fua you might remember if you were a chess fan was the youngest person to cross 2800 since then he has fallen down and nck from the modern generation of Junior players is the first one to overtake Ali Reza so nck was playing in the Prague Masters which is a tournament for masters that was held in Prague just watch these games all right Norbeck won a a a multitude of games in a variety of different different methods this is really just just badass stuff so he opened a game with E4 this is the second round of the event uh and his opponent is David Navaro one of the strongest players in the Czech Republic in fact I think the highest rated player in the Czech Republic uh it started out with an Italian Bishop C5 C3 Knight F6 D3 this is a very very very popular setup for white it is the main line defending the center maybe preparing a Queens side expansion slowly preparing D4 black plays d D6 Nock right away attacks the queen side threatening to trap Black's Bishop now that is not where the game ends David Navara plays A5 B5 the Knight is pushed back and now nobec plays Knight bd2 and both sides castle and The Meta of the position will be determined by the center pawns if either side can expand if black can create counterplay with the c Pawn we're about to find out the Knight rotates to the center and now immediately Nock opens fire on the center of the board take take and here comes Navara right back with Pawn to D5 take take so white is left with an isolated Center Pawn a solo standing Pawn uh there is a smudge on my monitor on the C3 Square you can't see me cleaning it but I am cleaning it right now uh and basically white is going to put his pieces around that Center pawn and try to pressure the black position with the following moves Queen B3 and Rook E1 you see Navara defending himself I did say that that move was going to happen I really like this move from David Navaro just planting the Knight on the B4 Square however White now plays Knight E4 and the pawn cannot be captured because after Knight takes D4 Queen takes D4 white would play Bishop B2 with a monstrous attack on the black king for example if Queen here you would play Queen C3 and there is actually no way to stop Checkmate because F6 you would hang your king Knight E5 delays Checkmate indefinitely but definitely it will happen so yeah you can't do that so we have Pawn takes B5 a takes B5 and here we go noer Beck is beginning the active operations onto the F7 bond nordbeck is a menace of an attacker he is so good at coordinating his pieces look at this every single piece he has is involved in the attack every single one they're all doing something the Bishops are pressuring on the diagonals the knights are standing over here you may ask yourself why is black not playing H6 because white is just going to go here like white is just standing around waiting to make this move and then once black were to capture The Rook would no longer protect that Rook so you would go here and and every single piece is involved in the game literally every piece nck has has a role in the attack so Bishop A3 Rook d8 David Navara down 25 minutes as he's trying to defend himself NOC captures the Knight and puts this Knight on the C5 Square now things heat up all right of course when you analyze grandmas games with the computer the computer says well obviously just Queen takes D4 and then after Knight takes F7 you play Rook C8 and then have Bishop D3 you have Rook takes F7 like the computer kind of finds a way to kill the Allure but if I turn off the evaluation bar and you just have to defend this position with black as your opponent swarms you from both sides of the board Snipes you down the middle and on the side ready to get in with the Rooks it's a problem it's a very problematic position which is why David Navara isn't able to defended perfectly Rook C1 counterplay is created and now the position explodes noyb plays Bishop takes F7 check now that Bishop is not touchable because if you take it you walk into a pin and you can't have that because white has the backwards knight jump Knight to D3 with an attack on the queen pressure on the rook and then you're just going to take the Knight because the queen is what we call overloaded the queen cannot protect both pieces at the same time so the King goes to h8 and if we just take a moment we pause here we count the pieces two Bishops and a knight two knights and a bishop no JRE is only up a pawn what's the big deal well now he rotates his Queen over the big deal is he's got eyes over here he's going to try to get onto the king side as well black plays H6 and now this is just a gross move I mean what noyre plays here just Knight takes B7 taking away another Pawn from his opponent and attacking his Queen now here Knight E2 check is a crazy move if you take with the Rook you lose defensive this rook and you get mated if you take with the queen you lose defense of the Knight and that's exactly what happens but now nordbeck plays Rook C6 this is crazy the Knight is hanging but you can't take the Knight if you take the Knight it's check it's here and I play Bishop G6 and you just lose you just get mated you can't take the Knight so watch this bishop takes D4 nobe gets the king out of the diagonal and now we have Rook takes F7 and in this position noer shows the entire idea that he had up his sleeve right now he's down a piece noer is down a full Knight right he lost one of his Knights and if he takes this after this black has two Bishops for a rook and a pass Pawn this is just a winning position for black so what did not have up his sleeve in this position well in this position in all this chaos Nock finds Rook to D6 hanging The Rook the idea of Rook D6 is nasty it is simply if you take the Rook your back rank is cleared and it's mate because my knight which is hanging but you haven't taken yet protects and doesn't let your king get out the reason why that couldn't just work right away is because if you played Queen H check which looks like mate I come back with my rook and my Rooks protect each other I don't take your Rook if I take your Rook then it's Checkmate then it's Rook takes and Rook takes so Rook D6 disconnects the position this is still a problem Queen E8 is a problem David nvar thinks for a bit plays Rook C8 now we take because now we get the bishop and the dust settles and in this insane tactical Skirmish it is nck emerging the pawn gets to B2 the pawn gets to B7 but unfortunately White's Pawn is much stronger and uh David defends himself The Rook comes back to D1 that Pawn's not going anywhere and that's it you win the pawn you're promoting your own what a win all because of this move Rook to D6 an absurd move Rook D6 cut the circulation cut the communication of the black position setting up threats of Queen E8 mate if you played Bishop B6 I would have played takes takes I would have mated you and if you played after Rook D6 H takes G5 I would have played rook d8 and when the king came up I would have made it you like this which is absolutely brutal Nock finds Rook D6 disgusting absolutely disgusting but at this level you also have to be able to win with the black pieces and let me just show you I mean the show that nck put on in Prague was ridiculous he went for Sicilian he tried to win every game the dragon The Accelerated dragon is absolutely not something that we see anymore at the top level of Chess it's just not it's because there's a lot of other things that you can play with black where you get an okay position but nobe is a 100 points higher rated than his opponents he wants to win every game he thinks he's the best player Knight A5 right this is a peaceful Dragon the the most aggressive way to play the dragon is to Castle Queen side and to go for an attack but white plays what we call a positional dragon with short Castle Nob says positional smal all right here's my Rook here's my queenside counterplay I'm going to put my knight on C4 I'm going to take the bishop here we go Bishop G5 Rook E8 solid position Matos Bartel from Poland mobilizes and goes all all in in the center take take now we don't take the bishop we put the Knight on C4 cuz we're being annoying we're trying to attack this Pawn we're trying to get our opponent to take us so now for me this is the obvious move to pressure this to pressure this no ner Beck transforms the pawn structure this now attacks the queen and it restricts the pawn move movement and when the B Pawn becomes a c Pawn the B file becomes open we don't care that this Pawn is a weakness Queen E3 because now we are going to spend the game haunting our opponent's Queen side and and completely not worrying about this queen E4 Queen A2 no says listen bro if you don't want your Queens side pawns I am absolutely going to go take them now Bartell says I want to attack you Queen H4 it's like poker ner Beck takes another Pawn he's just like he I'm just going to take all your pawns on the queen side Queen A2 Queen B2 it's really funny because white is saying you're stupid if you take those pawns cuz I'm going to Checkmate you and no is saying you're stupid if you let me take these pawns because you're not going to Checkmate me right it's the beautiful thing about Chess it's just a Silent Communication of who's the bigger that's really what it is right so Bishop takes E7 now Nock says I'm not locked in here with you you're locked in here with me now you can't get out good luck putting a bishop on F6 because then I'm going to trade the Rooks destabilize your Center and then I'm going to disconnect your queen from the defense of this and this right your queen can't guard everything so H6 Bartel plays Queen F4 Nock if I told you from this position nobec wins this game in five moves five moves from this position okay I understand you see the evalar you think black is better but it's just like Bartell was completely fine from the opening I mean the position is just balanced but people get so uncomfortable playing nck that they try to make something happen right they just kind of want it out like in a fight fighters always say like people want out of a fight and and when Norbeck puts this pressure on you you kind of just want to make something happen just to clash and see what occurs right Bishop takes E7 Queen F4 nobec goes here and just says give me the last Pawn Bartell jumps into C6 and nck says you know what take take and take everything in White's position is gone all the pawns are gone black is going to win the pawn on C2 black also just has a pass Pawn he just has a pawn like nobody stopping that pawn clearing all the way down to A1 Bishop D6 he trades he wins the he won the whole Queens side noyc literally walked in and ate all the queen side pawns because white just decided it was better not to defend them and to go for counterplay he makes one aggressive move on the king side n's defend defends his backr Queen F3 Queen B3 all the pawns are protected and they are just going to start marching and Bartell resigns how do you make it look this easy this guy is 2660 Fay this guy's the third highest rated player fourth highest rated player in all of Poland there's vasik and there's Duda and I'm pretty sure it's Bartell and he made it look effortless he made it look so simple Bartell's a great player this is the kind like ner backck plays so uncompromising he's just trying he's playing a dragon the dragon Sicilian is not seen at top level it's a great opening but it's not seen at top level because it's a little bit too risky it's a little bit too provocative nope not for Nob now he had another game with black this game was ridiculous this okay Bartell 2660 in his 30s I think you could say oh he's the old generation you know all these young guys now they're a big challenge for each other yo here's a game between nck and Vincent k these dudes are six rating points apart on the official list Vincent kimer is the same age as nck these guys are pe's in the same pod they are the same generation nbe shows up and plays the Queen's Gambit accepted another opening first of all no one at top level is playing D4 D5 They're all playing Knight F6 E6 looking for a NSO Indian ready to defend against the Catalan Nob says you're not getting any of that I'm taking the Gambit you are playing on my terms now the most peaceful way to play this opening with white is Knight F3 and then E3 and then these guys play this endgame line and it's very solid yeah but Vincent kimer is trying to win right he plays E4 but you know who else is trying to win basically at all costs this man no your be he plays Knight C6 the main line here the main line is E5 which is just symmetrical Pawn play in the center of the board very solid n plays Knight C6 and immediately gets into a wrestling match like look at these pieces Tangled in the center of the board you can't take because of the pin I'm defending my Pawn I'm G to strike at the center like this right Bishop E3 H3 we take we damage the structure we we allow white to have this big structure and get his Pawn back but we play E5 and the point is if you take on pant I play Queen D1 Rook D1 F6 I'm threatening this Pawn right you can defend it then I'm going to play Bishop to B4 you can take the pawn here but then I'm going to take take then I'm going to to take and like nck has insane analysis in this line that runs really deep so E5 Vincent comes back to E2 after spending some time Vincent spent 15 minutes the best line was to grab the bull by the horns instead we have the following position big structure for white but damaged black doesn't have a lot of central space okay so he takes queenside space like NRE has one of the most uncompromising Styles in chess right now you just you don't you don't want to get into a big battle with him you don't want to create this level of imbalance because he will outplay you Vincent plays A4 no back what he took you I mean you give me this position 10 times out of 10 I'm playing B4 why would I ever open up the bishop open up the B file Open up The Rook I'm shoving this Knight back and then I'm going to Castle but ner backck he didn't like that he didn't like shoving the Knight back because if the Knight comes back it's going to dance to C4 and he EV evaluates the opening of the position as beneficial for him I would never I would never play this move why would I allow my opponent to get activity well because the Knight drops back then I'm going to Castle and actually it is black who is getting activity as well I'm telling you Nock is like a like a give and take kind of guy Rook G1 to attack on that side of the board he castles right into it The Rook is staring at his King he castles right into it and says come and get me you want to play Bishop H6 my Bishop will defend my King you got nothing so Vincent goes back to C2 and now nck says A5 I'm getting out of the way of getting captured A5 you I'm allowing the knight in I don't care Queen E7 now Vincent finds a nice idea Knight A7 to try to get to C6 I mean that looks nasty the Knight Will exert pressure on the entire black position and right at this moment nordbeck lashes out on his own he is now trying to create an attack what's crazy is this is just a free Pawn but you triple your opponent's pawns who now has tripled isolated F pawns isolated H Pawn isolated D Pawn every Pawn structure in White in in White's Camp is isolated nobody has a neighbor they are all separated so F5 is a ridiculously deep idea but here's the thing if you don't do anything about that pawn that pawn is either going to shove your Bishop back or open up the position anyway I'm telling you uncompromising Knight C6 the queen goes to F7 Vincent tries to advance a little bit with the H Pawn El gets the king to h8 so now the king is out of the line here out of the line of anything over here and out of the line of the Knight Rook G5 Queen E8 slides back opens up the rook and defends the pawn now Vincent's like you know what I'm uncomfortable with where my king is I'm going to run my king out of the middle of the board H6 pushes The Rook back now again I'm I'm telling you I don't the moves no makes are so alien to me that after he makes them I have to appreciate them the best move in this position for black is to play A4 which gets the pawn out of the line of the Knight but it it it it allows it to be taken but it can't be taken because the queen needs to protect the bishop so after take take you would play take the queen can't take because you have Knight F6 and the pressure on the center is too strong and if this the King has to walk into the middle and then you Queen H5 check so A4 is designed to not be taken and if the thing is if you don't take it I'm going to keep going I'm going to keep marching into the position which is why Vincent decides to capture he's down to seven minutes he's down to seven minutes the entire position is about to fall apart here comes noer back he gets in with his Queen and he's a pawn down he's a pawn down where is his counterplay his counter plays right here he's threatening Knight C5 check King gets out of danger the Knight goes to F6 who's going to guard the pawn in the center I got news for you nobody Vincent down to 1 minute the Knight comes back to F6 this Pawn is under attack who's going to defend it The Rook which means the other side of the board is going to have no defense and he gets the pawn on F2 Bishop F2 Queen F2 Rook E2 we don't trade Queens Queen E4 Rook F4 Rook C4 check and Rook takes H4 and in this position from up a pawn to down two a three Pawn swing in like seven moves Vincent kimer resigned noer showed up played at Queen's Gambit immediately got into a jiujitsu match limbs are Tangled in the center of the board we go all the way down and I mean this is just the ability for nck to make Controlled Chaos of his games and beat a top 15 player as strong as him as young as him as hungry as him as skilled as him it's just it's just something to be in awe of and to get it done against the guy like Vincent kimer like this to just make him this uncomfortable make him down 30 20 30 minutes on the clock ridiculous and if you thought that was impressive this next game's going to blow your mind if you had the patience to sit through 20 minutes of content now you're going to get rewarded because I was floored at this game I mean I was floored at like the Nara game like again Controlled Chaos is is so rare at the 2750 chest level they're all they're all trying to move the wooden figures like one square for 7 hours and make draws but oh my goodness watch Paran makulu also like 20 22 years of age unless parham's like older now like sometimes you know years go by you look at an athlete you're like they're 28 I thought they were like 20 you know this was a Sicilian Defense so param showed up to fight number one ranked player in Iran nidorf Sicilian it doesn't get more uncompromising than this H3 the Adams attack to try to go for G4 E5 you don't have to remember these names it's not going to be on a test Bishop E3 Queen F3 G4 as you can see there we go right away with the uncompromising style long Castle but the thing is it's actually param who who who said right off the bat like I want to fight like in hockey when they say I want to fight you know it's amazing it's the only sport where you could fight for five minutes nobody touches you I love it I still sometimes watch highlights of the Flyers Penguin series from like God I don't even know 20076 eight when they just fought every game that was the series where the Penguins would win a game by one and uh the the Flyers would win a game by like seven goals ridiculous shout out to Claud jeru they I CL CLA Claud jeru I jiru is that his name I don't know anyway have some hockey knowledge not as much as other sports Knight G6 anyway uncompromising style sides are preparing for an attack castles here we go all right Bishop F1 Paran plays Knight H4 Nock sneaks in this bishop capture Pawn takes solid ID not allowing white any progress Queen slides out of danger the Knight goes back to play to F4 so far Nock has not gotten a chance in this game baramas controlled him very well but nbe is resilient he's going to keep poking but no param is now is now making strides toward his position it's a very very very tense game let's see if if nock's nervous system holds up Nock here plays A4 which is ridiculous you are not supposed to move pawns on the side of your own King like this right Parham Knight F4 Rook E3 it's black now who has a slight Advantage according to the computer G6 trying to make progress on that side of the board Knight comes back Nock making everything solid but if anything it's param who's going to start coming down the H file this is kind of bad so sensing this sensing that the position might start tilting soon to Black's favor nobec fires back with his own weakness he uses his broken arm to hit his opponent in the head how is that even possible well the the point is after this is black would be left with just floppy pawns and then you would go here and black would have to play like G5 and then white would just immediately get in so instead of that param takes the Knight puts the Rook back and is ready to capture back but this gives white time now that param is going to do that this gives white time he gets the bishop to A6 now he trades The Rook because he's going to infiltrate on the C file take take param takes on G5 Queen I told you infiltration on the C file Here Comes Pam's Knight look at it dancing into the white position this game was ridiculous Pam's infiltrating on the H file someone's going to lose it's basically just a Race Against Time Rook E3 Rook H2 oh my goodness the Knight goes to F1 attacking the rook and the Knight is still hanging the Knight dances out hitting the Rook defended by The Rook which can be taken by the White Knight but if the white knight takes the Rook it stops defending its own Rook which is why we have Rook C3 Knight goes to B4 so the queen is now hanging The Rook is also hanging if you move the queen black comes here and this is really unpleasant but NOC planned all of this out and after night B4 he sacrifices his Queen oh my goodness he gives up the queen to get the pawn two squares closer to the promotion but the pawn is under wrap like it can't go anywhere but nck sensed he sensed that this was the plan he now brings the bishop back and his game plan he gets extra 30 minutes because they cross the 40 moves it's a very common thing in chess you're going to get rid of this Knight you're going to push this pawn and basically the idea is that this position is always winning for white it's winning for white cuz the queen can't move the queen can't move the king can't move white will now spend the rest of the game just mobilizing and taking stuff it's very easy so sensing that sensing that that's going to happen param blockades the pawn with the Knight that's going to be really difficult to get rid of nerc understood that and so he he he got the fact that in a distant distant world all he has to do is get rid of this blockade and he has a chance to win he is now ready and prepared to take as much risk as possible watch what Nock does standing completely unafraid of the black queen he plays Rook C2 Bishop C4 allows param to come to him to get rid of that blockade look at that he's going to get rid of that Knight the Knight goes to E6 now we have B3 if the queen goes to A7 the pawn will get to C7 but but he's ready for that all right in this position Queen A7 might have given black an advantage according to stockfish is always always kind of ruining the parade it would have been better here apparently for him to move the king first or even play G5 limiting the black King's activity plays B3 pan plays Knight D4 NOC gets the pawn to C7 that was the entire idea all along now the queen is ready to come in this is very scary param is going to come in with the queen get to the king threatening The Rook this is very very dangerous but I told you nck is prepared to take as much risk as possible Rook D2 check hide the king queen here what do you move if you make a queen right now I take check here here here and it's made and if you ran forward just m one so this is a crazy move n goes Rook H2 how on Earth is white going to make progress here look at black you can't take because your Bishop hangs what do you do you still can't make a queen no finds G5 and now after Knight takes F3 Rook F2 Pawn takes this man sacrifices The Rook with a check to get this position Bishop Knight pawn pawn The Black Queen now has to go back and nordbeck uses his pieces as a shield you cannot give me a check because if you run out of checks I'm going to go Bishop D7 and queen this is so ridiculous he finds a defensive setup where black has to find the only moves whereas White's idea is to go here and get the bishop there and make a queen how on Earth do you you stop this if you are playing with black queen B7 Bishop this is insane the only defensive setup here for param makulu the only one is to play King f8 because if he plays this which is what he played in the game the Knight now hits F6 and that matters because if the bishop goes to D7 you cannot take now I know I know what you're saying this is check actually I apologize I apologize that was a terrible demonstration let's go to C4 instead Bishop D7 you can't take with check this is why I commentate the games and why they play them the point is if the king is on f8 then there is no Bishop D7 because you cannot take because Knight F6 check is no longer a check so the black king has to Dance 2 f8 and 2 G7 it's still not over because I'm gonna go here and then after king queen C8 you gota you know you still have to find All the Right Moves because I'm gonna I'm going to try to walk in a different way and then Queen like essentially the the the defensive idea is to not allow me to get the king to be6 I get the king to B6 I win because I I I get the queen out anyway that's the point nck creates such ridiculous practical problems for his opponent his opponent blunders now we have Bishop D7 it's check it's King B3 it's Queen B7 it's King C2 there are no more checks you make a queen and if you thought that was brutal he ends this game in an even more brutal fashion he sacrifices his Queen he did not want to deal with the queen on the board plays Queen G8 check black has to take then he will be forked I'm going to win the the queen back I'm going to take all the Pawns in this position baram makuda resign and no back ABD won the Prague Masters 2024 but ironically lost only one game and that one game was against the pride of India Prague himself Prague Nando rames Babu prag had a good event he had an up and down event uh but he he won more more games than he lost I believe he was the only one to beat noyre but right now all eyes are on noyre he gained 12 if not more points in this tournament and he is now the fourth highest rated player in the world Magnus Carlson fa Carana hikara Nakamura no abdor you talk about good company that's crazy in the fifth highest rated player in the world is now dingly Ren NRE is now the only Junior to surpass the rating of Ali Russa fuia he's the second youngest person to ever become a world champion and he might be the new villain of Chess or hero usbekistan you got a real one uh that's all I have for you today get out
