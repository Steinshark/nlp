for all your scientific paper writing needs   there's a saying in the flat earther community 
that goes a little something like this if the   Earth was a globe then the drop to the Horizon 
would be eight inches per mile squared now there's   a lot to unpack in that sentence so for a start 
what is the drop to the Horizon more importantly   eight inches per mile squared that's a distance in 
one unit system as a ratio of an area Miles Square   that seems to be implying that if you take the 
distance to the Horizon in miles and square it   and multiply it by eight that's the drop in inches 
it's very confusing and when I was recently at the   mass Jam a big annual Gathering someone called 
Dave heartburn did a talk about this where they   tried to reverse engineer what the flat earthers 
were trying to say and what they came up with was   well first now if you do assume the Earth is 
flat and you stand in your look your line of   sight stays parallel with the ground like forever 
but if the Earth was a globe it would drop off so   you stick with the looking straight out you assume 
that's kind of tangent to the globe that you're   standing on and then you've got your distance 
around the globe and you want to convert that   distance around the globe to the height difference 
the amount that your line of sight is above the   drop down to the Horizon and they're saying if 
you take that distance in miles and square it   you get the drop H in inches but does that work 
I mean the correct equation if you do assume you   are on the globe which I do I am a spherical 
no I'm a I'm a ball earther a baller for short that's how I'm commonly described then you do 
all the trigonometry and the actual equation is   one minus COS of the distance to the Horizon 
that D divided by the radius of the Earth   all multiplied by the radius of the Earth 
and that is a very different equation we   can compare them to see just how different 
you know we're checking it in a spreadsheet so I got one column which is the distance to 
the Horizon in miles and then this column here   is a times whatever that is squared So in 
theory that's the drop in inches but over   here we're going to do it for real and that 
equals well it's uh one minus the co sine of   oh wait I need to do the drop in 
miles but I've got to divide that by   the radius of the Earth but we're 
doing things in miles one second Earth in miles uh just shy of 4 000. here we 
go in Miles I'm gonna pop that up there and   it means in here now I can have that distance 
to the Horizon divider by the radius of the   Earth in miles I'm just going to lock 
that in there and then it's all of that   times the radius of the Earth in miles all 
right there we are there's the actual drop   but it's in miles we want it in inches ah how 
many inches in a mile how many inches in um 63 360. okay so it's each of these then 
times the number of inches in them oh what pretty much exactly the same oh no Okay 
so Flat Earth as say if you take a one   mile distance and square Multiply eight 
it's eight inches down and we got eight   point zero zero two all the way down here 
eight times six squared 288 correct answer 288.087 that's so close what if 
we extend this down a bit come on down 153 miles away oh my that's still it's not 
exact but it's close for completeness I have a   jojoba file here of the Flat Earth approximation 
function in blue my friend Ben Sparks made this   for me and the units we picked on the horizontal 
and indeed vertical axes is ratio of the Earth's   radius so we're looking a distance to the Horizon 
between zero and point six times the Earth's   radius we can now turn on the actual drop to the 
Horizon function in red and look how close that   is what a match that like so incredibly close and 
down here like if we Zoom right in to like quite   close distances perfect match so only when you 
zoom out you start to see some Divergence between   the two and then eventually you see they are 
completely different functions of course one's a   trigonomic function so the cosine is going up and 
down up and down up and down that corresponds to   technically if your distance keeps going out you 
just start lapping the Earth and as you're lapping   the Earth the drop is just yo-yoing up and down 
whereas the approximation one over here in blue   well that's well it's a parabola because it's a 
it's a quadratic because they're just squaring   the distance so it's a nice neat polynomial of 
order two so you get this Parabola here nice and   neat very different function if you zoom right out 
to a trigonomic function but if you zoom right in   look at that match it's like on this kind of scale 
it's an incredibly close approximation I mean well   done flat earthers uh from from a baller that's 
impressive it's such a good approximation I'm   prepared to overlook some of the other problems 
with this situation like when you're looking at   the Horizon you don't look tangent to where you're 
standing that's just like looking up into the to   the sky you look tangent to the Horizon because 
that's where your line of sight hits the edge   of the ball and there's refraction in the air and 
all these things but we're overlooking those this   is not a video to dunk on flat earthers that 
would be a very different video that we might   do in the future foreshadowing but that's for 
later that's still over the horizon if you will   or indeed uh won't here I'm rolling back my sass 
to say Well done flat earthers it's it's a really   good approximation and if that is something you 
want to work out that drop following the curvature   you don't want to do trig on the Fly I mean I'm 
a big fan of trig functions but they can be a   nightmare to work out whereas squaring something 
piece of cake multiplying by eight no worries nice   simple mathematics they took a complicated formula 
they turned into a nice neat tidy polynomial and   that that's amazing I mean if only we could do 
that to every annoying function swap it out for   a nice well-behaved polynomial well we can here 
I have four dots and if I push this magic button   the durable file put a polynomial through all of 
them and because I started with four dots I get a   cubic because if you've got n dots you'll always 
get a polynomial of order n minus one so that's   the highest power in the polynomial that goes 
through all of them and doesn't matter where I   put them that will always be the case these four 
dots arrange them anywhere I'm always going to   get a cubic that goes through all them oh apart 
from a few weird edge cases like if I line that   one up perfectly there it'll well wait where 
is that going to break they're broken there   right there it doesn't work but apart from those 
weird cases you always get a polynomial and the   great thing about a polynomial it's so well 
behaved all you're doing is multiplying by a   coefficient and then raising your variables to a 
power straightforward it's easy to work out it's   easy to differentiate it's easy to find zeros it's 
just it's easy to do everything so you take your   complicated formula you put a few dots on it and 
then you know you've definitely got a polynomial   that will go through those dots and you can use 
that instead genius and this jojoba file was   actually made by another friend of mine Matthews 
groggs who you may remember from the Menace video   I made many years ago about the matchboxes that 
play naughts and crosses and they were also doing   a talk at the same mass Jam conference and they 
showed this and they mentioned that sometimes if   you're trying to approximate a function with a 
polynomial can go with just a little bit just a   tiny a tiny bit wrong this was scroggs's first 
example a plot of y equals 5 to the power of x   a nice simple looking equation but algebraically 
it's not that nice what's that X doing up there   we have to get a log or something to reach that 
how annoying let's turn it into a polynomial put   a few points on it fit a polynomial lovely and 
as we add more and more points that polynomial   gets closer and closer to the original function 
amazing so add as many points as you need to get   within the tolerances you're in business how can 
that possibly go wrong you know what we'll just   look at one more example of how great it is before 
we wrap this video up second example y equals one   over one plus 25x squared it's the inverse of 
a polynomial so lovely got that adorable little   bump in the middle we can add a few points and 
we start to get an adequate approximation of   it with a polynomial but as we add more and 
more points we get further and further away   what are all these things and what are all these 
we don't want this we want but that's nice the   approximation down there is working but what is 
this nightmare this is something called runge's   phenomenon where you're trying to approximate 
that bit over there and the M bits just go wild   Run games phenomenon where you try and fit a 
polynomial but you get these crazy wild spikes   often happens when there's kind of a change in the 
level so we have a nice flat range of Dots here if   we raise one of them up while fitting a polynomial 
you can see not only is it a bit of a mess where   the Spike's going in but what's happening over 
there like trying to move a DOT over here is   ruining our fit over there if only there was a way 
to fix this yep another cut another Joshua file uh   this is another one that scrogs made showing that 
function from before and these points are equally   spaced and you get runge's phenomenon when there 
are equally spaced points So in theory we could   move these around to try and get rid of those 
annoying spikes at the edges and put that that's   not bad over there so I've kind of fixed the left 
we can try and smooth out the right that's better   because if I bring like I'm not gonna move the 
middle one right because if we go off center   it's it no longer meets the Peaks let's put that 
at the top there and I think that's not bad by   moving them out because if I bring these points 
into the middle that's where oh what a mess but   I put them over here it's a lot better so it turns 
out instead of having the points equally spaced if   we push them out to the sides we get a much better 
approximation but is there one Arrangement which   is particularly good yes there is that's why 
I'm asking it's great instead of arranging our   polynomial points so they're equally spaced on the 
horizontal axis if you project them down instead   you can start with a circle equally space the 
points on the circle then project those down onto   the horizontal axis and then they're the points 
you use for your polynomial fit these are called   Chevy Chev nodes or shabby Chev spacing and it is 
way better if you use this distribution or you've   got more on the edges and fewer in the middle 
in this very specific pattern you get a much   much better approximation and here it is isn't 
that much nicer with the Chevy Chef spacing we   get a much better approximation as a reminder 
this is what it looked like before nightmare   but now lovely and we can have that one raised 
spot from before this is it moving backwards and   forwards with the equally spaced points and look 
what happens if we switch to Chevy Chef spacing   way way better and we now have what we originally 
intuitively incorrectly expected before we thought   surely more points equals better approximation and 
now with Chevy Chef spacing that is true if you   keep adding more points you're guaranteed 
to get a better and better approximation   I know what you're thinking at this point you're 
thinking what about my function probably in that   exact tone of voice honestly but I assume a lot of 
you will have some function you're thinking well   how does that function compare if you've got the 
Runge susceptible equally spaced points compared   to the Chebyshev's distribution of points well 
Matthew Scroggs has you covered they've written   RungeBot which works on both Twitter and Mastodon 
so on Twitter here I'm going to @ RungBot and then   I'm going to give them a function so I want the 
function of x equals let's try the square root of   x oh you know what specifically X and I'm going to 
use Python notation so star star is power but you   could use an up Arrow I just know that RungeBot 
definitely does all of python syntax and it does   do some of other equation uh notations that people 
use but I'm going to send it X the power of a half   and send there we go right so wrong gearbox now 
got that it will take a while it'll process it   and send it back and like I said it does work on 
Mastodon to be more accurate MATHStodon that's   the maths Mastodon server guess where you'll find 
me if you go looking and one of the great things   about that server is if you're on it if you use 
latex for equations it will render that perfectly   uh not if you're on a different server but you 
can still see the tweets you just see the latex   but it makes it nice and crisp which brings us to 
this video sponsor overleaf now I don't actually   use overleaf but someone else in my household does 
it's a dog Sky uses no it's not it's my wife Lucie   okay who's a real scientist and actually does use 
overleaf uh that's why the dog is here with us   um you know I know you would if you had 
to collaborate on a scientific document   um so anyway when I mentioned overleaf 
we're going to support one of my videos   Lucie got very excited because she 
used it I use it all the time and it's it is it means I can collaborate really 
easily um so I don't have to email around   documents everyone just sees the sees 
the same file everyone can comment on it   it's so easy there you go now how did you find 
out about overly well um I saw my PhD students   using it and I thought oh that's a pretty nifty 
what were you doing at the time oh I was still I   still had the files myself and I was compiling 
the latex files and converting to PDF to email   around and you saw them using over belief you're 
like what is this magic I felt like a dinosaur I   mean what can I say and you started on the free 
account yep started on the free account and   that was really good and but then my institution 
bought a license so now we get all the features   that's bad if you want those features you can 
get premium as well huge thanks to overleaf for   sponsoring this video do check out overleaf.com 
now it's time to see what Scroggs's RungeBot has   given back to me for my square root of x plot 
so I'm going to go into notifications here and something went wrong Matt Scroggs can you please fix me so there 
you are wrong incredible incredible it's broken   we will fix it in fact now we'll cut in this is 
what it should look like isn't that amazing well   done by the time the video goes out we'll have 
RungeBot I'll take some of that Overleaf money   and we'll spend it on RungeBot servers to get it 
it's probably literally running on a Raspberry Pi   in Matt's cupboard so we'll improve that and 
if you want to check out Mastodon if you've   heard about this uh alternative to Twitter I am 
on the mathstodon.xyz server but whatever server   you're on you can all interact across that's 
my dog eating some of the lighting film we're   gonna go stop that we're gonna stop the video 
thank you for watching bye what have you got
