I like to work as little as possible and because of that I like to automate as much as possible and that's what we're doing today we are going to be building with python a python expense tracker and this is a great way if you are someone who wants to keep track of your expenses you know remain diligent make that profit I don't I don't know save your money and why are we doing this with python well for one it gives you complete control over how you want to track your expenses we will go through building application with python to track them but then from there you can take this project and really customize it further to further to further automate your life automating by automating you get the point not to mention python is one of the most widely used programming languages I mean from data science machine learning web development the list goes on so this is something that even if you are not a developer understanding Python and how it works even at a very basic level will really help you stand out in your career I know so many people who are both on the technical side but now even on the the non-technical side or traditionally on the non-technical side who are learning python for that exact reason all right let's get building well actually wait we're not filming here we're not building here we're going to go build in the dining room because it's a higher level table for us all right now let's go we're back all right and you can see I'm in my dining room with Jack Nicholson hell so on screen here you can see we have VSS code open and what we're going to do is walk through each section of the code explain exactly what it is doing so when you are building this you know exactly why you're doing it but then also too how you can further CU magical music automate your life all right so you can see here we created a class called expense this can be called whatever you want in this case because we are doing the expense tracker it makes sense then we have this knit method here which will create an object every time we fill out these information so we have date description and amount but you can also add more to this these are just the three things that I really want to focus in on all right next up we created one more class this one is called expense tracker now there will be two classes start this project one being expense one expense tracker expense tracker as I'm sure you can guess by seeing this empty array here is going to collect the list of expenses whereas expense will be the individual expense all right so you can see I added some extra things in here as well we now have ADD expense remove expense and VI expenses and these are the three options we are going to prompt ourselves in the terminal uh when we are going through adding in our expenses so first with ADD expense it's pretty self-explanatory we will pass in expense and then for remove expense this is more interesting so we will check to see if the expense exists based on the index and if it does exist and we want to delete it we can use Dell for delete and this is a built-in statement that we can use with python it's very self-explanatory I feel like with everything in python or for the most part anyways a lot of it is so self-explanatory or it feels like you're dealing with natural language meaning it's English language or it's just really easy to read and to build things with which is why we love p python so if it is if the index does exist we can print remove expense or expense removed successfully otherwise we will put print invalid expense index can't speak today okay next up here you can see we have view expenses and this will display a list of the expenses when we choose this option which is my favorite because it's a really good way to calculate what I spent in a day which by the way it adds up faster than you realize which is terrifying all right for view expenses you can see here we are checking to ensure that first expense does exist based on the index so if it is equal to zero there will be no expenses found but we got expenses we are expenses expensive we are expensive all right so then we go down here expense list where we are doing a for Loop basically and we are going to print the date of the expense the description we're passing in and then also to the amount now once again back at the top here when we scroll up you can add as much as you want I just did three date description amount but we can really get creative if you want start with this and then keep on adding all right let's scroll back down so then after view expenses we have the option for total expenses so when we have when we print out the options in the terminal there will be the option to view expenses remove all of these options remove View and total expenses so total expenses will just give the total uh number amount for the expenses so you can see we're doing that here doing another for Loop going for expense in self. expenses which was right at the beginning also if I sound a little funny it's because I feel like I I we went to we went on a trip last week and I feel like I spoke to more friends in 2 days as an introvert than I did in 2 years because everyone came down to celebrate us it was anyways lots of fun but my voice it's not great all right back to the code all right so now we add it in main which is the entry point for the program and you can see here it is going to be calling expense tracker now this is really cool this example is of course for expenses but you can really take this logic and apply to so many different things within python it's a really great way to understand the fundamentals the basics I don't know why I always do this in fundamentals but you get the point so here well true we are going to do the option for add expense remove View and total now as you remember scrolling up a little bit this is where we added in this class expense tracker the options to do this so this is now just printing the options for the user which is you or me so you can see here entering your choice 1 to five this is just any text you want then we go into ifs and else ifs so if the choice is number one which is ADD expense you can see here enter in the date I wanted something to add in the date because I feel like often times I wanted to do view expenses by date seeing what days I spent how much money the total amount of money then if it's number two you can also I remove the expense view number three is View and then four is total expense which we will be using quite a bit as well this is so fun it's honestly this is done in 67 lines of code which is pretty incredible I'll link down below the files for this I'll upload them to GitHub so you can also start building with it but once again as I mentioned this code you can take and really personalize and make your own as well but it's a great way to automate your life in the sense of being able to track those expenses let's go ahead and run this so now all you need to do to run it if you are new to python or if you're not then just refresher is go rightclick run python run python file in terminal okay here we can see we have this so expense track menu let's add expense the date is um April 18th of for you're actually seeing this the next day I'm filming this today posting it tomorrow that is called efficiency or last minute I don't know what you want to call it okay description what did we spend today mugs oh he's napping now he doesn't care did we get dog treats we actually did get dog treats yesterday but we'll pretend it was today just for this example the amount he is an expensive dog I think we spent like $80 on dog treats cuz it was for him and Harry okay so you can see here expense has been added successfully so let's go ahead and view expenses nice okay so I also put in earlier while I was testing this for groceries which was $10 and then also two dog treats so it's kind of cool you can see you can imagine like the dates as you keep on going it will the list will keep on growing it's so handy honestly now let's go into view total expenses number four $90 isn't that so cool now let's try remove expense enter the expense index to remove this I think we could improve so the index for this one would be let's remove number two two okay now go view expenses again and now it's just groceries it's pretty cool I know it's a simple project but it's a great way a something very useful that you can use to automate and B it's also very useful to learn the basics of python as I mentioned even if you're not someone who is a developer I mean if you are it's great too I mean even if you are a developer it's great to continue to build upon that logic I've been a developer for seven plus years and I still feel like I'm constantly learning especially if you're not using a programming language often then you come back to it it's fun just to Tinker and build these prod projects that have real world impact that you can actually use and build upon but also too they're fun like they make it enjoyable as I mentioned I linked the code down below the GitHub repository for It Go build let me know what you want to automate next this was this was automating but I feel like we could take it to the next level Maybe by prompting by to enter on automation an automated notification okay now my brain's getting going leave in the comments what we should build next if you like these kind of videos and make sure they hit that subscribe button all right see you all soon [Music]
