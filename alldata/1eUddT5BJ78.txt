NASA's Curiosity rover has already long outlived its minimum projected 2 year lifespan clocking more than 2400 Martian days as of June 2019 with hundreds of experiments carried out and almost half a million images sent back to earth curiosity has been pushed well past its design limits of all the systems on board that have furthered our understanding of the Martian landscape none have been as critical and is overworked as curiosity's onboard computer system curiosity's entire mission relies primarily on two identical onboard Rover computers called Rover computer elements or RCS these single board computers were designed to be hardened from the extreme radiation of space safeguarding it against power off cycles each computer has 256 kilobytes of EEPROM 256 megabytes of DRAM and 2 gigabytes of flash memory they both run a safety-critical real-time operating system known as vxworks VxWorks is used heavily in the aerospace and defense industries and can be found in the avionics systems of a variety of aircraft at the heart of the rover computer elements is one of the most expensive CPU systems available the bae systems rad 750 costing over a quarter million dollars per system board the rad 750 cpu is a ten point four million transistor radiation hardened processor that has been proven in dozens of space-based deployments since 2005 the single core CPU is based on a PowerPC 750 architecture and can be clocked anywhere from 110 to 200 megahertz offering over 266 million instructions per second of processing power and operating on only 5 watts it's manufactured on a die almost twice the size of its commercial counterparts employing either a 250 or a 150 nanometer photolithography process comparable to commercial semiconductor manufacturing of the late 1990s this process contributes to the CPUs immunity to radiation and tolerance for the extremely high temperature swings of space the rad7 50 can handle between negative 55 degrees Celsius all the way up to 125 degrees Celsius the posed by radiation on silicon-based micro electronics can be both disruptive and destructive high-energy particles can cause a single event upset in which radiation causes unwanted state changes in memory or register disrupting logic circuitry destructive strikes known as single event latch a single event gate rupture or single event burnout are permanent effects of radiation that can pin logic circuitry into a stuck state rendering them useless the rad7 50 is capable of withstanding up to 1 million rads of radiation exposure this level of hardness is 6 orders of magnitude more resistant than standard consumer CPUs by comparison a dose of 100 to 200 rads delivered to the entire human body in less than a day may cause potentially fatal acute radiation syndrome while the rad 750 cpu was extremely robust for space use the motherboard as a whole was less hardened it could only tolerate temperature ranges between negative 55 degrees Celsius and 70 degrees Celsius and radiation exposures of about 100,000 rads the weaker motherboard components would eventually prove to be a source of trouble for curiosity when curiosity landed on Mars in 2012 it operated on one of its RCEs known as the side a computer immediately after landing a major software update was sent to the rover flushing out the no longer needed entry descent and landing application and replacing them with software optimized for surface operations this was due to both the memory restrictions of the computers and the need for post launch software development the ground optimized update included programming to operate the rover sample acquisition instruments its robot arm and its six wheel drive system however by the 200th day of the mission the sighted computer started to show signs of failure due to corrupted memory the rover got stuck in a boot loop which prevented it from processing commands and drained the batteries NASA executed a swap to the side B computer so that engineers could perform remote diagnostics on side 80 in the following months it was confirmed that part of Saia days memory was damaged the unusable regions of memory were quarantined well NASA decided to keep side B as the primary computer due to the larger amount of usable memory the side B computer would operate for most of curiosity's mission but in October of 2018 computer issues would surface again when it began experiencing problems that prevented the rover from storing key science and engineering data left with no other options the curiosity team spent a week evaluating the site a computer and prepared it for swapping back in as the primary computer with side a once again active the curiosity team was able to investigate the issues of the side B computer in greater detail determining that it also suffered from faulty regions of memory similar to how side a's faults were handled the bad regions of side b's memory would also be flagged in quarantined from use as of June 2019 curiosity's still operating on its side a computer on the lower memory capacity caused by its initial failure however on March 12 2019 the side a computer experienced a computer reset that triggered the rover safe mode this was a cause for concern as it was the second computer reset within three weeks both resets were caused by a corruption in the computer's memory suggesting further damage within the memory of the site a computer despite the glitches the Curiosity rover still remains functional on its side a computer with the team contemplating and eventual switch over to the side B system but with the slow decline of both computer's memory systems it's possible that the deathblow to curiosity's extraordinary mission performance may come from within the handful of chips that form the memory of its computers to learn more about how computer faults plagued the previous generation of Rovers check out the video on the opportunity mission over on Elder Fox documentaries
