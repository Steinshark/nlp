the writing team is moving to the lab which means I've got to set up my new office and while I've never been one for trophy hunting and decorating I have hunted down such a rare species that I simply couldn't resist the sign of my now defunct former employer NCIX now Die Hard viewers of the channel will know I'm something of an NCIX collector I bid on their YouTube play button I've been trying to get their old domain and YouTube channel and I even dug around in the trash to fish out their old video host so what better way to demonstrate my love of NCIX memorabilia than to make the inside of my new office look like the outside of a crappy Shopping Plaza I can think of one and this is Linus Tech tips and this is an NCIX sign my PC and but it's not going to be easy I have to get all of these components in here with adequate cooling the sign obviously still has to light up it's going to have to mount on the wall because it's a sign and it's only this thick like this thick Segway to our sponsor Zoho one with Zoho one there's no worrying about using multiple platforms and pieces of software to manage your business Zoho 1 provides you with a single unified platform that's both comprehensive and easy to use start your 30-day free trial using the link down below so uh here's the plan no there is no plan throw away the prompter we're off the rails from here on out let's go now as far as I can tell the N is the only letter that's really big enough to fit even an ITX motherboard so a rough plan is to go wait no that's not right oh motherboard's got to go in the X for extreme that's not actually what it stood for it just didn't stand for anything netlink computer incorporated I think our best bet is going to be to just find the biggest components and start with that where could these things possibly fit the eyes got to be the radiator but motherboard we could maybe go X yeah we could go X as long as we go top or bottom mounted i o already the lack of planning is showing I'm sitting here going yeah the x is probably best because that would be the one that's closest to where my desk is where is my desk going I don't remember even the shape of the office first I need to figure out where I'm putting my GPU in this one it's gonna be a bit of a challenge now I know what you're thinking lioness you don't need such a gigantic powerful GPU in an office PC and you're right but come on what better choice for the defunct business sign PC than a card from the defunct GPU division of EVGA might have some new ideas I think you're gonna move uh oh that could work that's fine you can just go over there right I think the power supply is going to be a real problem here uh yep that's not gonna fit at all let's explore some other options oh right we're also moving Logistics over to the lab there are no power supplies here let's go on a little Adventure okay and we're here 100 watt 500 watt oh I see a Silverstone beefy one right there do we have Silverstone compatible long occurs to me I should come up here too and figure out where the devil on the wall is gonna go it doesn't have walls you only have this ball yeah I don't even think this is like a real wall though this is like just uh modular like panel thing shoot Tanner yes how did we not think of this there's no walls because then we wouldn't be able to think of it now yeah we're gonna make this one work we're gonna just cable manage Network and power along here up this wall and to the PC the desk will go here these will be perpetually down so I won't have to worry about Reflections and I'm just gonna have to have a small desk this even gonna fit we better get this cracked open did you know this is it too thick for sfx well the idea was that we're going to put a back on it just to keep all of the letters together anyway so if we raised it in a little bit to actually allow us to put some cables behind there and not have them sticking out of every letter we might as well have a little bit of extra room for the power supply as well it's just like cheating though doesn't it I think it's got to fit in the sign well the other option is the 12 volt power supplies like what's currently in your desk oh and I won't need my desk PC anymore good job on the LED lighting uh whoever made this got some VHB tape oh it stinks yep that's the smell of the rest of them oh it's disgusting yeah it's almost like it's been sitting outside for long periods of time possibly mounted to a building all these LEDs are going to have to go oh no crusty VHB tape twist is definitely the Strat there we go we'll be putting our own lighting strips in here black clean English does it fit and the power supply doesn't fit that means we're basically going to have to go DC to DC power supply these looked a lot bigger from the outside than they are on the inside I was thinking radiator and fans no problem radiator barely I know the plan was pumping the sea but what did you have in mind for a reservoir oh that is a good question fortunately we have a plan to figure all of this out see this big piece of cardboard we're going to take all these letters and we're going to put them on here and place all the parts motherboard GPU somewhat aligned with the pcie slot so the idea is we're going to have a riser that wraps around here and plugs into the GPU oh boy is that ever going to be tight oh yeah at work Tanner I don't know Linus how is how gonna work when you pitched it and said we need to have something in every letter I I did say that we go to RADS we have one as an intake and one as an exhaust in the end so there's a little bit of room for air to float wait no oh crap yeah we can't get fans in it okay we need skinnier Reds maybe slim fans even okay wait where's it even gonna take in air from are we gonna have like like posts or something like that that hold the backing off the wall and maybe we could count on the back for some airflow yeah I was really hoping that we'd be able to uh with the backing have enough room to I don't know amount of a couple small fans up top below I don't you're making this up as you go that's this entire project yes the good news is I think I found us a reservoir okay this classic from Swift Tech could be just perfect this is a bad situation we did find a power supply this is an 850 watt 1u power supply from fsp that I was going to use for a rack mount gaming PC at my house but now is going to live in here but the problem is that it's not really designed to run an RTX 3090 and it doesn't have enough PCI Express power connectors and I can't find any Splitters or adapters that are going to get us there wait this has a pcie pin out but doesn't appear to actually plug into a pcie connector what is up with this power supply here's your 8-pin EPS connector okay here's your six plus two pcie here's another six plus two pcie except it's split into four and four even though you can see the color coding is correct on the wires but it doesn't plug into this I think this is just a dumbass manufacturing defect okay I looked at the manual the data sheet for this it's supposed to be two six plus twos yeah let's see if they're all defective we have five of these oh come on they're all defective oh oh no this one okay oh yeah these are dual 140. yeah yeah that's not what we want yeah now what we've got right now is one of these I think we can there might be another one of those around if I were to really really dig but I could not find a second one I think today is a proof of concept today oh absolutely so let's go with this just one is fine you can put two RADS in the finished build we are about to have a classic do as I say not as I do moment here we've got a daisy chained dual eight pin connector coming off of our power supply I'm taking that first one splitting it into two eight pin connectors and then the second one and using that for my third eight pin connector on this 3090 this is a very temporary installation okay geez this is gonna be freaking tight in here gonna have to mash this down or something this is pretty low profile actually this is going to help save us some space we're just gonna do a slot in here and then we'll run this right through the back of the eye into the box at the back oh yeah perfect it's notable that even if these are Gen 4 risers which I don't know maybe they are maybe they aren't we wouldn't be daisy chaining them and getting Gen 4 speeds so we're gonna have to turn our motherboard down to gen 3 speeds which is fine for 30.90 anyway obviously this Riser is going to have to come up inside the X so it's going to have to sit kind of right there and like come up here and kind of Bend real tight here wow that's going to be really challenging counter yeah yeah it can't be that bad right just kind of go like that oh yeah oh yeah you're good you're good most of our cable extensions are missing in the move right now but we did find a couple of short 24 pin extensions um but nope aha but I have a second I don't think I'm gonna get oh oh nice no it's gonna reach yes uh almost yes good it doesn't look like it but we are actually getting dangerously close to test time I've just got to put this sabrin two terabyte drive in here at least that's what I thought I was gonna do I took off the heat spreader on this motherboard and there was already an SSD in it some of the custom ddr9 9000 cl69 memory that Micron did up for me next up we've got the CPU water block I mean come on did you think I was going to go air cooling this is using ek's exact Mount and oh crap Tanner I think we have another problem what's our problem we're gonna have tubes coming out of here I think it's going to be too tall as well do we not have the ability for right angle fittings there's a lot of things interfering with this right now maybe a measuring tape would be in order before we started we only have six centimeters to work with which would put us like basically right here pretty clear that this is not going to work Tanner did you factor in the height of the GPU block let's get the GPU block out I don't know if any of this is going to work man I don't think the GPU is going to fit in the eye my thought with doing this was that we could take off this front area here that's fine but the issue is that we've got the pcie connector over here that's hanging off the edge of the eye and we already don't have enough margin here to slide the eye on top I have grossly miscalculated if we don't use the foam as a stabilizer for the backing it might just fit I think we're still on business we still need to figure out this we're not licked yet they have one new water blocks and we're going to run the tubes like over here between the pcie Riser and the ram so all we got to figure out now is a pump and this is not going to be it this is a DDC x-top from UK we actually need a bone stock DDC which has the inlet and the outlet on the side and is much lower profile because this is clearly not going to fit oh man you know what even if we can't get our hands on like a 1u block or something that'll fit we could just adapt one of these old GPU blocks boom low profile done this will be a good enough placeholder for today the point is to just figure out if this is going to work and we can create custom mounting brackets and adapters and all that kind of stuff over the next few weeks and you can tell we're in the middle of a move right now not because I showed you we're in the middle of the move but because clearly this um video is a little bit here's how we're going to do the red the red and something newer and skinny that would definitely be good here we go I just need this right angle crap even this one really we're gonna have to find a lower profile fitting what about the fans at least these slim 120s should be enough to handle this as long as we've got two of these radiators in here so we're just gonna go ahead and do a little something like that well here's some additional fans to be placeholders for where that other radiator is going to go oh Tanner yes the radiators will just have holes and they'll punch through into the box that the sign is going to be mounted on so they'll just go straight into the back yes easy don't even need right angle fittings okay this is what I was worried about with the clearance for a pcie extension okay that puts us about here and then the clearance we need for the top of the block with the fittings there is no way we're going to fit this EVGA 3090. the most frustrating thing is there's so much empty space on this PCB did it really need to be this big EVGA you've literally got holes in it fortunately this pre-water cooled card from Asus has no such problem if we run the fittings into the box that's going to be at the back I don't think there are any clearance issues here at all this is awesome and we're down to just two eight pin power connectors meaning that we don't have to have that really sketchy adapter I think we are getting dangerously close to test time oh you might have noticed we swapped out the reservoir the other one leaked not where I showed you the cracks but in one of the other fittings for lighting these strips from Elgato not perfect but they're easy to control and they're definitely good enough for our test here and plug one two not bad I really don't know how well the RGB effect is Gonna Shine through a blue you know thing but I guess we can find out ah hmm we are definitely gonna have to do something to get more even lighting above where components are like this big dark spot where the motherboard is some of the other letters might not be as challenging though like I think the eye is going to be okay you can't even really see it ah you can see it a bit uh this might be about the best we can do for the sea for now wait yeah oh yeah no one mocks up quite like LTT powered on X for Extreme Performance the whole reason I took the x office foreign there we go great I know it doesn't look like much right now but this was an important exercise to figure out all the little things that might have blindsided us later when we do the final build and I think we've solved all of them did this just reboot not a great sign get it hey there we go I think to make our lives easier for lighting we should use white components wherever possible yeah no that sounds like a good plan if we can find white fans for these radiators for example I think that'll really help with light kind of bouncing around to make it easier to light them up evenly okay apparently we're going to run 4K nightmare if I'm being honest ergonomics not great performance on the other hand outstanding gpus at 52 degrees CPUs at 73 degrees I think with the box in the back and enough airflow to the radiators this is going to be freaking awesome but when I died I died before I got a chance to tell you about our sponsor thanks to grammarly for sponsoring this video whether
