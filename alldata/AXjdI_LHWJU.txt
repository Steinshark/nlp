what's up guys yesterday I realized I'm 18 years old which means I can buy scratch off tickets now uh some of these have like the possibility of winning millions of dollars I'm not an idiot I know I'm not going to win The Million dooll jackpot or you know even get thousands of dollars I'm more just doing this for fun just to experience it I've never done a scratch off before there is a chance I can win Millions there's multiple chances I can win tens of thousands uh more than likely I probably won't even make my money back who knows let's just scratch them off and uh hopefully I don't don't get addicted sorry Mom all right guys before we get started I must rub the bottle of bleach for luck please bless these scratch offs and uh we have Steve here no one loves you Steve all right so step one if we match any two identical symbols we win $50 instantly so I'm just going to go ahead and scratch that off and uh see if we win anything on this one and no so these two don't match these two symbols which means I win that now same thing here but this time it's $100 uh let's see I'd be crazy if I won I'd instantly win back all the money I spent uh no okay so right off the bat we didn't win those two now I still scratch off the rest of these but I'm going to go ahead and do that on all the cards real quick and see if I won on any of them so hey what a shock none of the symbols on any of the cards matched honestly I'm not that surprised all right so step two is uh I scratch off these These are the winning numbers and I try to match these numbers up here with any of the numbers down here and if they match then I get the prize so basically I just got to scratch all this off oh okay so right off the bat we matched a 30 with a 30 okay yeah so that means wow I was actually not expecting to win anything it's probably nothing I won but so that's the 30 up here so I'm pretty sure that means whatever the prize below this I won I won $5 guys $5 I paid 20 bucks for this ticket and I won a whole $5 guys I feel so special right now this is insane uh I'm going to become a scratch off oh wow that's crazy wait so 14 is one of the numbers up here this is a 14 so that also means I get this prize oh that means we're up to 15 out of 20 so so far I've only lost $5 I'm not going to lie I wasn't expecting to actually win anything oh okay so as you'll see down here at the bottom it says if you have a seven you instantly win the prize shown for that symbol so uh yeah I have a seven so let's see what prize that is wow so the seven gave me $10 okay so basically on the first card I matched to 30 and got $5 I matched a 14 which puts my total up to $15 and then I hit a s which is an instant uh prize so basically on the first card I actually made $5 okay so what a shock on card number two paid $20 for the card didn't win anything not surprised though let's move on to card number three oh okay so right off the bat 39's up here we got a 39 right here so let's just go ahead and see what I won oh $10 woohoo half the money I spent on the card okay oh wait wow that's a 29 that's a 29 wow so I actually won this one as well hey so if they stack which I'm not 100% sure yet I'm sure someone will correct me then that's 10 that's 10 so I already made my money back off this card even though I didn't make any anything off the last card but we'll keep going can you guys see that the first three were all winners that's I don't know I've never done this before I feel like that's uncommon let's see what it is hey so I've made $5 off this card woohoo wasn't a complete waste d hey okay so we have a 14 up there and a 14 down here the prize is whoa okay so this card won $25 already and I'm not even done with it as 14 up there and that's 14 awesome all right so this card won me 25 bucks that's a it's pretty nice I can live with the free five bucks all right time for round two this time we're doing Carolina black same thing match these numbers with those reveal certain symbols I'll let you know if I get them yada yada instantly win all right so my numbers this time are 39 25 eight and nine all right no no no no no no no no no no no all right so this first card won me nothing yay all right our numbers this time around are 23 35 24 and 17 let's go oh okay so let me pick this up real quick so we scratched off a dollar bill and now it says reveal a dollar bill symbol when double the prize shown so whatever this prize is hopefully it says $10,000 we get double this is oh five bucks yay hey well seeing how this ticket cost $5 I just doubled my money that's pretty nice let's go I'm I'm feeling it I'm feeling lucky on this card this is the good card we won nothing sad face all right this is my last card let's go boys come on I I need a new pair of shoes isn't that the saying I don't even know why that's the saying cuz I like my shoes we got 4 6 18 and eight feeling it ah okay well this is the last scratch come on please please no oh man all right guys so four tickets these four didn't win me anything four tickets won me money through all this I lost $20 had some fun hopefully you guys enjoyed watching that should teach you not to gamble on scratch offs because I ended up losing 20 bucks and yeah this $20 I'll never get back for nothing so you definitely should not buy these see you later [Music] m m be [Music]
