let me quickly say that I've been a fan of the Jerry podcast since first started 10 years ago Joe's open-mindedness and just genuine curiosity it was a breath of fresh air especially to me as a scientist but in general as a thinking person he inspired me to be a better and especially kinder human being so it was surreal for me to be on there a couple of times last year and I'll be on there again a third time on February 3rd it feels like I'm Forrest Gump somehow finding myself shaking hands with John F Kennedy anyway I also enjoy playing guitar and I thought I play the intro steam plus a bit more to say thank you for the ten years of Jerry as a wise man once said train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you
