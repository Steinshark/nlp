so good old typing practice I'm not sure if any of you did it but when I was in school we always had to practice typing major practice with ideal sweaty try hard mode you know each hand gets one half of the keyboard thumbs on the space bar blah blah blah I personally learned the form more or less the only thing I could never do is type with my pinky because that's just weird if you can type with your pinky you're probably missing a few brain cells anyways I can type pretty fast I mean I hope so since I'm chronically online I have just a bit of brain ROM and I'm always on my computer because you know programmer if you didn't know check out how fast I can type all right I'm using my phone to record my hands um to see how good this is how do they do the ASMR they're like watch [Applause] this yes let's [ __ ] go let's go yeah so I'm better than you at typing now when it comes to typing games I usually go on typ racer or Nitro Type there's also the human benchmark test but that doesn't have multiplayer here's the problem I can type fast but not world record fast apparently the world record for typing is 212 words per minute but I've come across these videos by this YouTuber mythical rocket he does typing content and he's constantly destroying the official world record he's the actual final boss when it comes to typing I've been in the typing scene for quite a while now and I am excited to announce that I finally hit 300 words per minute on 15 seconds Oh shoot what the [ __ ] what the so uh there's no way I'm beating is what someone who can't program would say well since I can't be the fastest typist normally since I have a life you know I have some Tik toks to go through I'll just make a program that'll make me the fastest I bet these people can't program since they're just practicing their stupid typing form and what better way to prove that I'm the fastest typist in the world than destroying some kids on some typing games so I'll be creating a typing bot for typ racer nitro type and the human benchmark test because why not the bot should be pretty straightforward to make and it shouldn't take too much time it's probably going to be a simple python script with something like selenium or beautiful soup to web scrape the words and side note I haven't been posting too much I've been working on some other fun stuff so uh sorry about that I'm trying to be more consistent so uh bear with me anyways let's start with typ racer if you don't know what typ racer is you're either really young and you're still in diapers or you're really old and you're in diapers so looking at how typew racer handles words it seems they put them into these span elements and the class names for these look very similar now it seems they split it into two parts the current word you have to type and what's left to type but they split the word that you have to type even further to it looks like three parts what you've typed the next letter you have to type and what's left of the word so I think this bot might actually be very simple to make all we have to do is combine both parts into one part in order to get the entire paragraph once we get that paragraph we can split it into the individual words and from there all the bot has to do is type it this sounds really easy when I put it into words but um let's see if it's that easy to program okay so typew race seems to only use spans for the words we have to type and we can be even more specific because those span elements also have this unique attribute called unselectable so if we make the program only select the words that have this unselectable attribute it should give us what we need and oh would you look at that I already finished making the program the program's pretty straightforward I press these buttons and it's going to start the bot which is basically I just grab all the text once I grab the text it's just going to type it out for me nothing groundbreaking here all right let's see if this works let's test this out all right let's press the button yes what what the okay so I added these options so the browser doesn't close right away so it should work this time let's see if this works all right let's do this again all right let's press the buttons oh what the fck okay so it looks like the bot is typing too fast and typ Razer can't handle that so I added a little interval which makes it type a little bit slower all right let's do this again all right let's press the buttons oh my God yes it works oh my God wait what does that say you have been disqualified from the current race Under Suspicion of cheating how am I cheating I wonder how they thought of that I can definitely type this fast okay so I increased the interval a little bit so that the bot types A little bit slower so typ racer doesn't recognize that we're cheating and now it's time to become the fastest typist in all of typ racer let's do this shrimp alfredo wait what wait what is this typing challenge oh no I have to pass a capture test oh no okay so this just got a lot more complicated for no reason we have to pass a capture test a test that's specifically made to stop Bots okay all we have to do to pass this test is type that paragraph at a similar typing speed with passing accuracy what makes this difficult for Bots is number one it's an image so I can't extract it like we did with the typing paragraph and two the words are twisted to prevent OCR models from extracting the text and on top of that there's black lines covering some words to make it even harder so we're going to have to add on to the program to pass this capture test I'm still going to try using OCR just like in my cahoot video if you don't remember OCR stands for optical character recognition and in the most basic sense for your small brains to understand it lets computers read text from an image now this might not work because of the black lines and the Twisted words because these models are usually trained with ideal conditions like clean handwriting and not for Doctor handwriting but there's still a chance OCR can still pass this test and all we have to do is get a good enough accuracy and not 100% so here's the code I'm going to be using to extract the image and I also added a pre-processing step so that I remove the black lines from the text to hopefully make it easier to read but it isn't perfect since some of the words are still messed up so let's test this out and see if this works just finished doing a typing race let's test this out let's press the buttons and oh no it's not the worst accuracy but this is not good enough to pass the test H all right second approach surprisingly chat GPT is really good at extracting the words and way more accurate than the OCR model and funny enough open AI is really trying to prevent chat GPT from reading these images because you know it's passing the bot test which is kind of defeating the whole point of the bot test but I think I can use the Chad gbt 4 Vision model instead of the LCR model to pass the test here's the code for the gp4 version and now let's see if I can finally become the fastest typist in the world okay let's do another the race I also made the bot type a little bit faster yeah this is so stupid all right it's time to test out gp4 and hopefully we can pass this is it working come on come on come on yes it's looking pretty good actually wait I think it's perfect let's go captas ain't stopping me you can't stop my bot I am the best all right let's press submit are you kidding and there we go we passed the capture test and now we're ready to start racing made my account now we're ready to take over the world the goal is to be number one on the leaderboard and I lower the interval to type even faster time to pass this capture and finally get my name on the leaderboard I can't believe this works it's actually insane oh my God it actually worked we passed it I type 242 words per minute at 100% accuracy the proof is right there I'm certified my score has been saved it's been done I'm the best wait a minute I'm second place still God damn all right we're doing another race I lower the interval even more to make sure I get number one fools I'm at the peak of my typing abilities you all stand no [Music] chance easy peasy let's go oh I don't have to do the capture nice there we go number one in typ racer I'm the fastest typist in the world when it comes the typ braer number one number one number so I went to bed and when I woke up to work on this again um I came back to this um yeah so I got suspended well [ __ ] but don't worry I have a secret program that will get me out of this this program is going to generate an image and this image is going to get my account back so let's run the program and here's the image and let's see what it gives us got you yeah my account's just suspended so um some of you are wondering well what's this image then well I'm glad you asked

to destroying typing games and move on to the next victim nitrotype Nitro Type might be the typing game I used the most when I was learning how to type and now it's time to finally be the best player so it looks like nitro type uses a similar system as typ racer where the words are in bans so this should be a pretty easy modification to the program yep very easy Let's test this out all right let's see this press the buttons and yeah it works here too let's go all right I made an account and now it's time to get on the leaderboards here 2 1 [Applause] go 493 words per minute I am the Great greatest of all time no I got bad from Nitro Type 2 man let's move on to our next victim the human benchmark [Music] test yeah this also uses the same span system as the other typing games which means very easy to modify let's destroy this game and I put no interval on this since it doesn't seem to have any anti-cheat System since you know no multiplayer all right press the buttons and hold 6,685 words per minute what the [ __ ] now even though I said I was only going to make the bot work for these three games after seeing how easy it was to modify the program I also made it work for monkey type so let's destroy mythical Rockets typing score and show him who's the best typ in the world so monkey type system was a little bit different from the other ones but it wasn't too difficult to make the modifications it's time once I start this I've conquered all the relevant typing games and I have become the best let's finish the job I am excited to announce that I finally hit 300 words per minute on 15 seconds I've been trying for this for ages um and I'm just I finally hit it dude like this came out of nowhere um I hope you enjoy it nobody is a faster typist than me I am the peak I am the best
