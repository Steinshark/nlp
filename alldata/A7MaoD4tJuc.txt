the famous live streamer ice poseidon just scammed his followers for up to half a million dollars and i'm gonna prove it he personally profited three hundred thousand dollars by stealing money out of a crypto scheme that he set up and when i confronted ice poseidon who's better known by his real name paul de nino about this scam he was shockingly honest you want to keep the money that's not yours that you took from the project even though you'd failed to deliver i mean i'm not really sure what you want me to say but yeah i'm trying to like get you to return the money because it's 100 still available and you could do that yeah i could give the money back it is within my power um but i'm gonna look out for myself and not do that i i you know i don't like know what else to say that's just the most honest answer now these influencer scams are becoming more and more common in part because of how easy they are to pull off ice poseidon's scheme apparently took him only two weeks of work to set up before he apparently got bored with the project and decided to stop working on it and just took the money like seriously how long did you work i'm just curious well like you said it was a fork so a couple weeks couple weeks three hundred thousand dollars that's it's a nice chunk of change now i pleaded with paul or ice poseidon to return the money that he stole in part appealing to the guilt that he was taking money from his fans who were all much worse off than him ice poseidon's response was that he didn't like how that made him sound i don't know if you're aware of the fact that your average fan has way less money than you so you're just taking from poor people like you understand that right that is definitely not that that is not a good way to put it that's a pretty funny way to put it my dude it's uh it's a pretty pretty thing to do from the very beginning this story shocked me but especially the twist at the end that i can't tell you about yet but what i can tell you is that this is my most in-depth investigation yet into influencer greed cryptocurrencies gone wrong and the blockchain now i know it's been a while so let me remind you this is the 10 million dollar studio i'm your host coffeezilla the internet detective and well it's good to be back [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in order to understand what happened with ice beside we have to rewind the clocks back the story started when ice poseidon first got into crypto i invest in a lot of the like coin like a lot of the you you put money in and then you sell in like 20 minutes when it pumps ice poseidon first got into crypto just buying a lot of meme coins but like many influencers he quickly realized gambling on another person's coin is a suckers game the fast easy money is actually in getting other people to gamble on your point now this moment is important it's the moment ice poseidon realized what a gold mine it could be to start his own scam you're telling me i could create a cx coin and then people could buy it because i could say that the community is super strong and then i could sell it in 10 seconds and make 10 million dollars what the am i doing ice poseidon would later say that the clip you just watched was a joke and that the idea of him scamming his fans was just a bit he played up for the audience but that core idea that he was missing out on a huge opportunity to make a ton of money was real and it nagged at him and pretty soon he decided to start his own cxcoin is the one to choose i'm the founder of cxcoin my name is paul dino and i decided to make a community driven token that i'm personally going to be a part of now almost immediately does got a lot of attention obviously given his past comments about sort of scamming people people were understandably skeptical of this and it came out right after save the kids and you would have thought that myself and other people like mudahar would have talked about this whole thing but heist poseidon was working incredibly hard behind the scenes which is something i need you guys to understand he was contacting people like myself and pleading with us that he was just joking back then and he was serious about this coin he wasn't about to pull off a scam like save the kids he was different he even mentioned in live streams that save the kids was gonna make what he was about to do much harder i know about the facecoin steezy that's why i'm trying my best to be as transparent as possible i've been working on this for like a month now and i wasn't gonna let that drama stop me but it definitely makes it a little bit uh more difficult ice poseidon repeatedly told skeptics that he couldn't rug this coin if you wanted to he had locked all his money up in a smart contract he told me that in dms he said don't worry no rug here all the money is locked lol and look i have to admit i was busy at the time with some other investigations and i gave him the benefit of the doubt something that i obviously regret now but periodically i would hear you know complaints from his community that they thought something was off but every time i'd go to ice would immediately respond immediately and he always gave me something that sort of sounded reasonable and i later learned he was doing the same thing with everyone who said something negative about cx coin in fact he got a dextero article killed about cx coin being a scam i mean i even asked him about this at the time and he said this the stero article went up and then down did you see that yeah i emailed dex proof i wasn't scamming so leaving that up quoting a twitter with two likes is a bit unfair to me the point i'm trying to make is he was playing the pr game hard telling everybody he was different he even gave me his wallet addresses and told me to hold him accountable he wasn't gonna do anything shady and everyone sort of felt like okay maybe maybe he's doing something different you know maybe everything he's been saying was you know just a joke dude if i see it if i see a million dollars i'm selling i don't give a i'm not gonna be like i'll hold for you guys bro i see a million dollars in my portfolio i'm out not gonna lie that looks bad but i'm gonna be really generous here and give ice the benefit of the doubt that clip probably was a joke and it was probably made before he was actually thinking about making cx coin into a real thing now as time moved on i and many other people sort of forgot about cx coin until january when i decided to take a break for a little while and while i was off i couldn't help but feel that there was something else going on i just had a hunch i had to look back so with my free time i joined the cx coin telegram and started tracing back the wallets that ice poseidon had given me so transparently and pretty soon i found out that well he gave me the wrong crypto wallets whoops he gave me the dx sale wallet instead of his personal wallet which didn't tell me anything for example one of those things he didn't tell me was the fact that he took out two hundred thousand dollars from the liquidity pool at the very beginning which is directly at odds with what ice poseidon told me himself when i asked he said don't worry all the money is locked up except for two hundred thousand dollars i guess but it also hit another story which was the misappropriation of the so-called marketing wall now according to cx coin's own white paper the marketing wallet was to be used exclusively to quote fund marketing campaigns in the cryptocurrency market but in the telegram there was another story going on ice poseidon was complaining that he had spent money on an ad campaign and it just hadn't helped but we spent 53k on a b talk and it hasn't really helped the wallet is limited he berated people who complained you want me to spend 30k on stuff that doesn't help or you want me to think about the best ways to use marketing money exactly you can't use the marketing money on well you know marketing instead the money seemed to go somewhere else shortly after this coin launched ice poseidon bought himself a brand new tesla this video was published july 24th and as he says he bought it a week ago putting it right around the time that he launched the coin and realized he had suddenly gotten a lot of money to his name but i'm sure all that money is locked up right apparently not and here's the interesting thing the longer things went on ice poseidon just sort of gotten more and more brazen with the way he used the money right at first it was just sort of sitting around then he started sending it to cash out wallets and eventually i calculated that there's roughly a quarter of a million dollars missing from that marketing wallet but that's not all ice poseidon had tricked his followers at this point by getting them to buy into a vision of a long-term project the whole idea was that this was going to be a donation platform for streamers and that it would take a while to build he kept reiterating this again and again i mean this is a long-term project i'm trying to you know we're making a donation platform so i'm gonna put that on my stream and this coin will just be around for the entirety of my streams he said this a lot in the telegram too you know this is long term right thanks guys i assume everyone is in it for the long haul anyone who invests in something should know this was a long-term project so one week is not going to see results now later i would find out this was a lie ice poseidon did not see this as a long-term project he actually gave up after two weeks but i think i'm getting a little ahead of myself the point is ice was getting brazen he was increasingly intolerant of people who called him a scammer saying they just hadn't done their research he even brought my name into it saying he had talked to coffeezilla maybe implying that i had cleared him and i've talked to these people coffeezilla i've talked to these guys i showed him i showed him the coin i showed him everything and you know they're giving me the benefit of the doubt so obviously they would call me out if it was a scam i'm gonna be honest this really pissed me off ice poseidon was using my name to try to imply that he was legit when in actuality he had just fed me false information about his coin and begged me not to talk about it but amazingly the final piece of this puzzle wouldn't fall into place until a few days ago as i said ice had been getting more and more bold thinking i guess that he had gotten away with this and on january 22nd 2022 using his wallet that he didn't tell me about he drained the liquidity pool essentially killing his own coin and taking the money from his investors to be specific he drained about ninety percent of the funds which is about three hundred thousand dollars now for important context liquidity pools are how you get money out of crypto right you can't just cash out a coin like cxcoin right you can't buy groceries with it someone has to be willing to trade you that coin for something that you know sort of has value so coins like this rely on something called liquidity pools a big sort of pot of money and what ice poseidon did using the fact that he created this coin he rug pulled 90 of that from his community which meant that that's three hundred thousand dollars that his investors would not be able to get back out and at this point i simply had had enough this was a scam he had lied to me from the beginning and he had lied to others about it and i wanted to confront him but i couldn't let him know that i knew anything otherwise he wouldn't pick up the call so i simply told him i wanted to and to my surprise he agreed and so on the 26th of january we had the call you're about to see and mind you i'm expecting him sort of to deny everything like who would take credit for this well ice would i guess it looks like the coin got rugged you know anything about that i mean yeah i mean not rugged but uh i mean well someone pulled all the liquidity out that's a that's a rug right that would be a rug yes uh but there is still liquidity in there 40k got left and 300k got ripped out or something like that yeah i mean that is exactly what happened right are you laughing i mean is that funny [Music] i mean no you're hearing this right he's admitting he took out 90 of the money but that's not a rug pull apparently he had to do it after all the crypto markets were crashing and if he didn't take out the money who would the crypto market is crashing and 300 000 isn't there there's two options right leave the money in there and then if bnb goes down it's like a hundred dollars the money goes to anyways or i could take it and the money is not just going to dust the money would have never gone to dust i mean it just would go back to the investors when they sold out when you told them hey guys i'm no longer interested in this project i wipe my hands of it you know you got your 50k in you got your 50k out you're good right you didn't deliver this is not your money i can't believe you keep thinking of it as like as your money that's going away that's your investor's money and it should be their decision what they do with it okay i mean that's fair point that's a fair point yet despite all these fair points i kept making every time ice got cornered about the fact that he was basically stealing from his investors he slowly pivoted his language from oh this isn't a rug pool to more like well the investors deserved it he said they believed too much in his project and his word like part of the responsibility is on them as well for being you know like putting too much emotion into it now look i want to be clear i agree that investing in any influence or coin is idiotic but the logic here seems to be insane they believed me so it's okay i scammed them i asked dice about this i don't know if you're trying to say they deserve it you're saying they don't owe some responsibility i agree with some responsibility but do they deserve to get ripped off no i mean nobody deserves that it's just gonna happen though like i said sometimes you have to look out for yourself uh i don't really know how else you want me to put it i mean if you i mean you could say it in all these different ways to make it sound as horrible as possible and you know what i can agree with you on some of those things i just don't like to put it in those specific ways because it makes it sound like that was the intention from the start which it wasn't and there it is the final refuge of every scammer i started with good intentions i meant to do the right thing but i kept reminding ice poseidon or paul or whatever like these excuses made no sense because it wasn't as if the money was gone it wasn't as if it had vanished he still had it and could return it at any point he doesn't have to go down as the scammer so i don't know why you're acting like it has to end with like you being the bad guy here that's not what i'm trying to do at all i'm trying to like get you to return the money because it's 100 still available and you could do that so that's what i'm not understanding is i want to get to that point i don't think we're going to get there if you want the answer uh yeah i could give the money back it is within my power um but i'm going to look out for myself and not do that i i you know i don't like know what else to say that's just the most honest answer now i do believe he's being honest here i believe this is the most mask off anybody's ever been on my channel most of the time when you get these guys on the phone they just try to deflect and dodge i don't think that's happening here isis being a hundred percent transparent and i realized it was a unique opportunity to get the full story of how these scams work ice poseidon proceeded to walk me through the details on exactly how long it takes to whip up an influence or scam like this and the profits you can expect from it can you tell me how much money you made off this i'll just call it a scam i know you don't want to call it a scam but it is a scam so what did you make of this well i got 55 and then 45 went to uh my developers so i don't know probably like 300 000 nice what it what a good what a good profit from doing um i mean how long did you work on this project like seriously how long did you work i'm just curious well like you said it was a fork so a couple weeks what do you plan to do with the money uh invest into crypto ethereum mainly well there you have it for two weeks of work forking someone else's program you can get 300 000 which annualized is a pay rate of 7.8 million dollars per year if he would just scam every two weeks it's not hard to see the appeal obviously but what blew my mind is that he hadn't gotten away with this like he got caught red-handed and somehow i guess i was just expecting him to go oh well okay i guess i'll return the money now but no he just kept doubling down you are deciding to do the thing you know that and you're still doubling down i am doubling down do you not agree though some of the responsibility is on people who if you're still holding something that's inactive for months like sure okay maybe they you know have faith in me whatever but that's not a good that's your fans dude that's your fans these are people who followed you since they were kids they admire you they look up to you that's the people you're saying well that's their fault i honestly couldn't believe what he was saying here not not that he didn't care you know i am kind of used to that but he clearly expects zero consequences for his actions right and this made me think that at least part of the reason for this might be because stories like save the kids which got huge press ultimately nothing happened don't get me wrong it's important to get these stories out there anyway but you have to understand the inner workings of the greedy influencer when you don't have law enforcement consequences for what is essentially theft and fraud you end up with people like ice poseidon realizing they can do the same without consequence and i'm not merely speculating here this clip you're about to watch is of ice poseidon discussing with his partner moises what happened to sam pepper one of the leaders of save the kid they don't talk as if he's a cautionary tale but instead as if sam pepper had won as if sam pepper had beat the system he stole money and he got away with it i mean i did watch that coffee still video i think sam's like a millionaire now so i think he's i think he still succeeded me although although he he got it in a very poor way he made up like abandoned bro sam's probably nowhere like probably has like three million crypto if the dude broke his lease if you got a bra yeah tesla to do paid like what was it 10 stacks to break his lease i don't know yeah if you're breaking your lease and leaving the country i mean you definitely if he really felt the need to do all that then he probably made plenty of money sam pepper scammed people but because he did it without going to jail he's successful he got away with it that's how these people think so is it any wonder when ice poseidon is caught also stealing money his response is oh well i'm just gonna look out for number one it's their fault for getting scammed they shouldn't have believed me he's just so obviously not afraid of getting caught and why would he in fact i asked him about this fact whether these things should be prosecuted and he seemed to think that this was a wild idea do you think the uh fbi should get involved with cases like this or like the sec or do you think like people like you should be prosecuted um no i can't say this enough these guys aren't scared they think they can do whatever they want they'll just fork a coin take 300 000 another 200 000 another 250k and walk away and screw you what are you gonna do about it oh and by the way in case you thought that this was just a matter of ice beside messing up once i actually found old clips of him admitting to um what seems to be some kind of credit card fishing scam i fished credit cards back when i was younger dude i didn't do anything um with the credit cards because i didn't i was like afraid of going to jail but that time he didn't go through with it because he was afraid of the consequences well that was then and this was now and now he's not scared anymore ultimately this whole conversation between me and ice ended with us just sort of going in circles me pointing out that what he was doing was ethically wrong him telling me that he agreed but he essentially doesn't care and i felt sort of like a failure afterwards to be honest um i didn't achieve my goal of having ice poseidon return the money to his victims however a few hours afterwards ice poseidon deemed me one last time he told me he wasn't going to give all the money back but he was planning to give a little bit of it back 155 000. now i want to be clear about this giving back 155 000 is better than nothing it's good for the investors who hopefully will withdraw their money as soon as watching this video but it's so obviously a last-minute hail mary for whatever is left of his reputation it's kind of pathetic i mean to be clear he's still keeping the bulk of the money he knows that and he knows that we know that remember this still leaves him with taking 200 000 from the project at the start another quarter of a million dollars from the marketing wallet which went basically nowhere and then three hundred thousand dollars from the liquidity pool of which he's saying okay i'll return 155 000 i don't know what this is supposed to demonstrate are people supposed to all of a sudden applaud as he gives a small fraction of what he took except wait a minute i just checked ice poseidon doesn't even seem like he can do that much after dming me i went to the telegram and his admin updated everyone and said we just finished a buyback of over 120 b b rocket emoji which is not 155 000 it's only 40 000 now whether ice poseidon has actual plans to put the rest in or oh my gosh return the full amount i really doubt it it's just amazing to see that ice seems to be doing this only because he got caught sort of got interrogated for 30 minutes and faces reputational damage yet he still can't muster the moral courage or at least fear to return the small fraction of money he promised and so to close this look i'll be honest in my opinion ice poseidon is not a good person i don't think he regrets anything or feels bad about any of this and i think the unfortunate conclusion many other influencers will come to when looking at this is that ice like sam pepper has finally made it he's succeeded in the influencer game he's gotten away with it or has he there may still be ways to prevent stuff like this from happening there are two things you can really do number one you can share this video so more people become aware of what ice did and get more eyeballs on it but two if anyone was scammed by cx coin and lost money they can report their losses to ic3.gov linked below this is the fbi submission portal if you've been defrauded or wrong and if enough people report things like this there's a chance people will be brought to justice i just hope it happens sooner than later that way i'll stop hearing about how influencers like sam pepper made it until then all i can do is report dig and investigate that's all for now i'm coffeezilla thanks for watching
