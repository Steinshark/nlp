welcome back to christmas in the 10 million dollar studio have you ever seen a take so bad it actually ruins your day like you're just on twitter reading the news and you see an opinion so backwards so terrible it physically disturbs you well not the brag but i have and i feel compelled to share with you i'm gonna set the stage for you guys but first pump the stock please it's christmas in the 10 million dollar studio we're trying to get to 1 million subscribers this month and if we do we're going to be able to give a bunch of money to charity but without further ado onto the video so here's how it happened i just watched mr beast's squid game in real life if you haven't seen it it's incredible basically won the internet for the day and i had commented square game in real life is the youtube video of the year amazing attention to detail and hard to believe how fast they did this mr beast is changing the game now this is not a controversial statement right it's like saying the sky is blue every person i knew was basically saying the same thing that day i mean they just nailed everything from wardrobe to vfx even the small safety stuff were just in place it was perfect and they made youtube look good they gave away money and they entertained a lot of people what could be wrong with that wtf your bio says i want to make the world a better place before i die talking about mr beast but you're wasting money and resources on building some random squid game you could give millions of dollars to everyone so no one is poor but instead you waste it on this stupid game now before we get into how bad this take is look i get it it's just one voice right that wouldn't bother me except that apparently so many people felt this way that it made the actual news youtube star mr beast criticized for 3.5 million dollar real life squid game the social media star stirred up controversy after sharing the 25 minute long video of squid game in which 456 contestants battled it out to win 456 000 and this just set me off because the whole thing here right um fundamentally is basically that mr beast hasn't donated enough or should have just taken the money he was going to spend on this and just donated it to charity now of course if these people had done an ounce of research they'd know that's what mr beast is known for doing his entire brand is donating to charity exactly one day before he launched this squid game video that so many people are mad at him for he fed ten thousand people with turkey dinners through his charity uh beast philanthropy and by the way the only reason that works is because of his high media profile which is created through videos like squid game so the irony is he wouldn't be able to donate so much money if he didn't do the videos that he did but on top of that people are criticizing this guy for not donating enough right as he's in the middle of raising 30 million dollars for ocean cleanup as well through team seas i mean that's the guy you're trying to attack that's the guy you're leveling the claim of you're not donating enough for people by the way who are just keyboard warriors i mean what have they done like accusing mr beast of not donating enough is like accusing the pope of not being catholic enough it doesn't even make sense logically mathematically the proof is not there the guy's entire brand is built around giving money and it's not even just on camera i mean i've personally talked to mr beast i know a ton of people who have met him too and everyone just says the same thing off camera on camera he's just a really genuine guy trying to help and it's even to the point where people criticizing him seems self-aware of the fact that yeah this is super unpopular to say and there's almost nothing controversial here but i'm gonna still find a reason to criticize this guy anyway i mean like look take a look at this raising money to clean the oceans the beaches and the rivers who could argue with that seriously who could argue with that well i'm about to i mean you can't even make this up because who could argue with it well i will um he goes on to say that because mr beast eats meat and isn't vegan um 30 million dollars in fundraising is a bad thing yes you heard it right that's the headline guy does good thing but is not an actual human saint so therefore he's terrible i mean you could literally do this about anything like this guy's thing happens to be veganism but um you could be a vegan and you drive a car to work okay so you're a terrible person now because you drive a car so nothing positive you do with veganism is good because you happen to drive a car or maybe you bike to work but you don't recycle all eight different types of recyclable material i mean we could just go add infinitum it's just oh you exist and you're breathing oxygen what a monster i mean look sometimes just things aren't that deep sometimes there are just good things in the world that we can all celebrate without pulling out our sophomore criticism and instead we could just try to enjoy something but instead everybody who does this is apparently a hypocrite if they are also not vegan and contributing to the climate crisis does mr beast really get about the environment or is he just doing this team c's campaign to raise his profile and all these other influencers making these nice little team seize videos do any of them actually make any differences in their own personal lives are any of them actually practicing what they preach are they just editing and putting out these nice little videos to raise their own profiles and make everyone think there's some kind of saints whilst doing next to nothing to actually help with the issues i mean this guy is really reaching here a lot of assumptions are being made about how much actual personal action people are doing in their lives and while i think it's important to highlight the fact that people need to make personal changes in their lives it's also so incredibly disingenuous to just absolutely dump on anyone doing anything positive in a public way just because oh oh they might not be doing everything right in their private life and by the way he doesn't even know that that's actually what triggers me about this whole thing is like he's just making the assumption that oh these people must be terrible they must be awful like it seems to me like if you're in 2021 and you're not a monk living in the hills on all solar energy if you even try to donate any kind of money to people you're going to be seen as human trash and videos are going to be made about how bad of a person you are i guess i just think there are so many worse things we could be solving or trying to uh or trying to address and instead we're just quibbling about a guy who gives to charity and like talking about how controversial that is i really don't understand it i don't get it it seems to me that a lot of the people who criticize mr beast they say that they want from their influencers people who are using their platform for good donating a lot of their personal money and that's just what mr beast is doing so it's like people ask for something it shows up and then those same people say not good enough i don't know i guess i just don't understand it uh you know it's not to say that mr peace is never going to do anything uh criticizable but it just feels like people want him to actually be a worse person than he is so they can like then go aha we got you it's that's stupid so hey that's it uh i'm gonna just link the charity drive below team c's for those who want to donate i think it's a good cause raising 30 million dollars for ocean cleanup i think it's cool oh and by the way uh just as an addition i'm adding this after the fact i filmed this all before the beginning of the month i know mr beast commented on her channel randomly saying like uh remind me when the to boost the subs or something like that which is dope but i shot this before that i don't want anyone to think like i'm on you know mr b's payroll or anything because you know that is that is absolutely not the case i would never never take money like that so um just so everyone knows it's absolutely no conflict of interest here so that's basically it thanks for watching [Music]
