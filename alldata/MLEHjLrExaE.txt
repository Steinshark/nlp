ladies and gentlemen if you're into chess whatsoever then you might be familiar with the name Hans Neiman Hans is one of two parties the second being Magnus Carlson involved in the biggest scandal in chess history the chess cheating scandal now since that Scandal broke out things have gone pretty quiet because there is a pending lawsuit information has to kind of be kept under lock and key as it goes through the legal process but what I've tried to do on this YouTube channel is update you on the career obviously of Magnus but also of Hans and in today's video we will be taking a look at some recent tournament games that Hans has played and the biggest setback that he has had in obviously recent months but maybe in many many years as well as Hans had quite a shocking result in some of his recent tournaments and he's actually lost some 25 ELO since his peak of being 2710 down to about 26.80 all right I got nothing else to say let's jump into the games so we're currently in Dubai well I'm currently in New York and you are where you are but these two individuals Hans Neiman and his opponent how when Zhu are currently in Dubai and by currently I mean a couple of weeks ago this was the final round game of the Dubai open Hans had been playing a ridiculous tournament schedule Hans in fact is probably the most active tournament player at the top level like he plays chess literally all the time and this was the final round game of a tournament Dubai Hans is boasting a very big midi rating of over 2700 here it's 26.95 and he's playing an Untitled and unknown individual from China who is like 14 15 years old he's so unknown in fact I couldn't find a picture of him I copy pasted the picture that you see on your screen from his YouTube Interview okay like this dude came out of nowhere and Hans is playing this this young guy from China and Hans plays a an E4 opening and his opponent responds with the Knight C6 Sicilian Defense uh looking for potentially a Kalashnikov looking for his fashionikov looking for an accelerated Dragon looking for a classical Sicilian we're about to see what happens now um Hans plays the move Bishop B5 and then he captures on C6 now in his post game interview how one said his preparation ended here what excuse me how is that even possible he said his preparation he just didn't think that Hans was going to take on C6 of course that's like normal but I guess Hans had played a lot of games where he castled and allowed black to play Knight here and then he would play I guess C3 or rookie one or D4 so he was actually already kind of surprised by this move and from from essentially this point forward he supposedly was playing on his own uh which is fascinating stuff now obviously we have the time stamps there uh and uh you know Hans plays the move D3 uh building for the center as follows uh since white already traded off their light squared Bishop you know you'd like to do something like this D4 is not a is not a terrible move but uh black can even play a move like Bishop A6 here and it's actually kind of annoying for white to try to Castle so you play Pawn to D3 clock responds with Knight E7 very flexible move uh black does not rush with committing a pawn to the center of the board black does not rush with playing the move D6 to try to play E5 all of those things are possible but instead black plays Knight E7 leaving it completely flexible where that pawn is going to go uh Han's Place knight bd2 uh Hans can also play castles Hans can also play B3 Bishop B2 to try to play on the diagonal Hans can also play Knight C3 uh Knight C3 is not the most accurate move because uh in many lines black will play D5 D4 and just in terms of the flexibility of the position white prefers to put the Knight on D2 so that in the future if he really needs to he can put the Knight here and then he can Target The Pawn on C5 okay so that's what Hans place his opponent plays D6 and it seems quite clear that his opponent would like to play the move E5 okay you do not have to be a rocket scientist black goes here with the very clear intention of playing the move E5 if Hans were to have castled in this position black would play E5 and have a very strong clasp on the center white might then play Knight C4 pressuring these pawns or white would play A3 looking for Pawn to B4 just trying to break apart this formation to make it not so simple for black to develop otherwise black will develop every piece very easily play F6 Knight G6 Bishop E7 castle and then just keep marching forward um so to prevent uh his opponent from having an easy life Hans plays E5 black snacks move is essentially forced uh unless he wants to suffer with a very bad position if you take on E5 you have doubled isolated C pawns for the whole game that's just not very pleasant it's not losing or even worse according to the computer it's just unpleasant uh the same thing if you play a move like Knight G6 after something like Pawn takes Bishop takes you just have doubled isolated C pawns for the rest of the game I guess it's just very unpleasant I mean I will go here I will go here and then I will put a bishop to Target your pawns and there's just absolutely no reason to do this so how one plays D5 right nice and solid life is good now anticipating the development of his opponent's Knight to this side of the board Hans in this position plays the move H4 another very common move as you can see from White's time usage it's clearly something that he has looked at and the idea is to play Knight G6 and then H5 something like this Knight G6 and H5 then black would be forced back because if black tries to come forward G3 if black comes forward that's nice so the Knight traverses the entire board and perishes in the in the grasp of his opponent let's not do that so Holland plays H5 he also spends seven minutes on this move I I clearly he was a little bit disturbed by committing his Pawn so so far you know maybe he wanted to go Queen C7 or do something on the other side of the board but he does in fact play H5 he sees his control of the G4 square but he does give away the the square on G5 now Hans plays B3 again light squared strategy a lot of things on light squares ideas like Bishop A3 Pawn to C4 Knight F5 Hans develops and now his opponent here plays a move that I I quite like uh which is the move A5 just trying to go for A4 Hans plays A4 Hans hasn't spent any time he spent no time at all clearly this is something that he has looked at he knows what he's doing and his opponent can play rugby Aid Bishop B7 continue on but his opponent here spends a bit of time and plays C4 that's a fascinating move it's just the loss of a pawn how in here just plays this move it's not voted as the bus move by the computer but he gets caught he gets Hans out of a prep out of his prep to the untrained diets just takes takes Knight C4 it's just a free Pawn there's no benefit to the position whatsoever white is a pawn up white is going to continue but the idea of uh C4 by his opponent was to open up two doors it was to open up this door and it was to open up this door and Hans is a difficult decision because if Hans ignores him he's just gonna knock on the door anyway so Hans can take with the d-pawn he chooses not to he takes what the B Pawn instead after thinking for some five minutes and now Holland just plays Rook B8 Rook B8 spends a little time rugby so for the cost of one Pawn he is now taking Hans out of his preparation and he is targeting his Bishop on B2 Hans goes to trade the bishop makes sense now black plays C5 don't want to trade the bishop he wants to control the file Hans takes on D5 black response he takes D5 to open up some squares for his bishop and Hans plays the move Knight B3 targeting both of these Pawns now what's funny is that already black can actually just play C4 again so the fun thing is that black a few moves ago played C4 but because he had doubled C pawns some moves later he can actually play C4 one more time but he chooses to play Queen C7 defending these pawns and uh keeping an eye on this one a very tense position against the player Oh nearly 400 points higher rated than him okay with some gangster stuff yeah I love this stuff castles Bishop E7 and now before his opponent is able to get comfortable Hans plays D4 which is a nice idea he's just basically trying to establish a very strong bind on the position computer would have preferred here if Hansa played Queen D2 targeting the pawn on A5 potentially forcing something like this and then playing Queen C3 but he plays D4 the idea is that if everything opens up white is going to be much better because uh this big trade only benefits white like Queen D4 you play rookie one and white is just in a very comfortable position so Hans plays D4 how one plays C4 so now the Bishops re-star at each other and Visually to me it makes sense to go take take Knight C5 here but you are losing a pawn if you're playing with white the pawn is just hanging it's kind of low-key like this was the position there wouldn't be a hanging Pond White would just be doing very very well because white has a knight versus Bishop a lot of dark swear control also just a clean Pawn up a very strong Center but you would lose the pawn so instead Hans just plays Knight C5 and here how one just plays a ridiculous idea I mean this is just he plays Rook to B6 the idea of this is to go here hello hi I'm attacking you on the king said what the was that even possible the thing about Hans is he plays these eight extremely tense positions place these positions within a margin of error is low high low is the margin of error low or is that is it very tense one mistake could lose the game on the spot so the margin of error hi hello I don't know I just make chess YouTube videos look at this this is absurd this man just traversed the board with his rook and is like indicating the Hans that he wants to he wants to fight E6 reopening the file this is crazy E6 Hans is like I'm gonna get a piece into E5 this is an extremely complicated game his opponent plays F6 covering these squares yes you are blocking your Bishop yes your Rook has nowhere to go back and yes white now has a past Pawn that pawn is now two squares away from queening but the position is mighty tense Hans thinks for a little bit plays Bishop to C1 the idea is to reroute the bishop to the other side of the board obviously and in the future you might be able to play Rook A3 and do your own Rook lift and you can move your knight in some ways and in some moments right just saying a lot of things are enabled Rook G4 how one gets closer Targets this Targets this and Hans just plays C3 Center is solid now black is not going to rush like this this trade is very bad it reactivates the dark squared Bishop so instead of that black just castles how is dudes Rook just on G4 like how is this even happening and the thing is again like if white just tries to do this it's Knight G3 it's Queen G3 it's mate I mean I mean the game is hanging on a knife's edge in many many many many many of these variations so it's really close uh Bishop E3 is chosen uh by Hans and now we have Bishop C5 DC if I remember a moment ago I told you that the bishop would come this way right I told you don't take the Knight on C5 because the bishop is going to act but when the bishop goes this way The Bishop's not activating there anymore and here comes how when d four do you know what the idea of D4 is my friends it's not the fact that you are winning an exchange the Knight and the Rook both see that but the pawn the bishop and the Knight and the queen all CD4 how the how is how windshield playing on a square how is he playing on a square that white controls four times because once again how windshield likes to open doors he is opening the door for his Bishop just like several several moves ago when he played C4 he opened up a door for his Rook he opened up a door for his Bishop some 10 moves later Howlin plays D4 Bishop takes Hans Neiman is up two pawns but Hans Neiman is losing Hans plays Rook B1 and now is the cash out process howanju has broken into the Vault of the casino and now he is going to get the bills Brooke takes G2 a man after my own heart he sacrifices The Rook on the G2 Square King takes G2 Knight takes H4 a check on the king a check on the king and an attack on the night and the bishop is coming in Bishop F3 knocking on the door if this queen gets to H2 the game is over so Hans has to strike back Bishop E5 a clutch defensive move inviting an exchange of Queens black plays Queen to C6 he doesn't want to trade you know what black wants he wants the queen and after that he wants made Hans in this position has to find the Absurd Rook to B6 with the idea Bishop G2 King to G1 Knight to F3 double check and King F1 and apparently you survive it ain't easy though it is absolutely not easy and you it you still look like you're on the verge of mate constantly and your Bishop is still hanging Hans plays E7 and how when all common collected takes the queen gives up a queen with check King takes and in this position all black needs is a queen and a horse between H1 check Queen F3 and he just puts his King on the edge of the board and now he's just winning he can take this the queen and the Knight will join together the only way you can successfully defeat a queen is if you have really good King safety and really good peace coordination and no weaknesses and right now white does not have any King safety and white has very big weaknesses and very limited piece coordination Rook D4 Queen G2 check Knight F3 how one picks up the Rook the queen goes back and I think it's just a matter of time until his pawns start going in there they go there they go I'm not sure you're going to be able to stop them the pawn is going to H4 he's three squares away two squares away Queen A4 check Queen B3 and it takes him 52 moves Queen C5 how was you just defeated Hans Neiman this is Hans Demon's lowest rated loss in like half a decade I don't I don't know Hans has had a ridiculous rise since like 2018 2019. I don't know like Hans loses to 2700s now and how and Zhu might very well be the next bright star from China he is born in 2009 I believe 2008. dude it's like 14 15 years old he's nearly 2400 he had a 2709 performance and he got a grand master Norm crazy I was crazy yeah what did what stunning I mean an absolutely stunning Victory now you would think oh well Hans is uh you know this is a bad streak and he's gonna no my friends if you had a little bit of patience this was Hans Neiman's very next tournament in fact I'm recording this June 2023 he's currently in the middle of this tournament he played this game a couple of days ago Hans with the black pieces playing against Max Lou strong International Master young young guy from America uh and Max lose a profile photo here looks like he's eight years old because there's just no updated photos on the internet uh his opponent played a Catalan Hans played his patented line he likes to play Bishop before and Bishop back to E7 and then Hans likes to set up a closed Catalan he likes to keep the center like this C6 D5 E6 he doesn't take the pawn he advances my friends if you thought Hans Neiman was done and he was in this irreversible slump what Hans does in this game is otter brilliancy this man trades in the center comes back the center gets a tiny bit of stability Max Lou tries to explode the center with the move E4 Hans captures on e4 Glides the queen out to B6 targeting the pawn on B2 looking at Knight C5 looking at Knight B3 type of stuff there it is now watch as Hans conducts the Symphony of his pieces Bishop to G4 attacks the rook and activates the bishop white slides The Rook over Hans brings The Rook to d8 now Knight to D3 is possible so Knight C4 counter attacks the queen trying a little bit of time back black plays Queen to B3 you cannot trade because I'm going to Fork you the tension here is palpable and in this position Hans finds an absolute lightning bolt of a move Rook to D one the position is an illusion of Defense it's an illusion of Defense Rook to D1 and the idea is as follows Queen D1 because if Rook D1 I would take the queen for free windy one Bishop D1 and white could go here but he plays Rook C3 with the intention of keeping of kicking the queen out I mean just for the record you couldn't take because of this I'm just saying that's one of the legal moves Rook C3 Queen B5 this was one possibility Hans looked at this position and said I don't like how active white is so when he attacks my queen I'm gonna go here Bishop C to the idea is that he wants to advance his Pawn to Target this pawn and make a queen something like H3 black would play Knight D3 strip the defense of all of this position and promote a new Queen and then white didn't take white didn't take his Queen White played Rook C1 trying to get the bishop Hans has another chance to run his Queen out of the position he says Nope my queen is there to die for a better purpose I'm sacrificing my queen this move was given a brilliant move because he's got absolutely no reason to sack this he had no reason at all so sacrifices the queen again with the intention of brutalizing the position over here for instance just so you understand Knight B2 Knight B2 Bishop E3 just getting in on this side of the board his opponent plays Rook C2 anyway and Han says all right well you had a chance to take my queen not anymore Rook B1 Queen F5 Knight F3 you can't beat a queen you can't beat a queen when it's mad Rook to D5 Rook H5 mate Hans bounce back from that defeat to a 2300 rated player with a perfect game perfect there was one move in this game that stockfish was like a little bit inaccurate this man played Hans loves this closed Catalan and he made it look effortless against the really really good player Knight C5 all of this stuff leaving the queen there to die like he just didn't even move the queen he just didn't move the queen ridiculous my friends it's um it's gonna be interesting to see I'm still absolutely fascinated by the case of Hans Neiman I I I am blown away at his rise up to 2710 I am fascinated at the unpredictable nature of his chest I have no idea what his playing style is it's just interesting to see what happens when he plays games that's it there was some report that came out that he was like being driven around in a limo and smoking cigars on a balcony this dude for better for worse is the most interesting character in chess second might be Eric Rosen I I am fascinated by the story of Han's demon I have no idea what's going to come out of the lawsuit I've got no idea about any of that stuff but when he plays I'm gonna watch and I'm gonna share it with you and I hope that you appreciate it now get out of here
