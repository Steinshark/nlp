- We are opening the
world's first free store. All this stuff you see here
is a hundred percent off. AKA free. Now you might be wondering,
where did this stuff come from? Well, here. I want that. I want that. I want that. Chandler. Oh, nice. Your turn. Buy whatever you want. - Oh, man. That's a whole TV. - Why'd you start off so expensive? - You said it was free. - So we're gonna keep filling up the cart but this is gonna take a while, so I'm just gonna cut to the full store. So as you guys know, tomorrow
we open up the store. Last time we sold things for a dollar and we didn't make money. I spent the last three months
convincing the investors to give us more funding. - They're dumb. - Which we put towards all this stuff. Look at this chart. I
don't know what it means. But what I do know is
everyone likes free things. - Yeah.
- Yeah. - Which is why everything
in this store is free! - Yeah! - We will make lots of money! - Yeah! - All right. But seriously guys, if
we do not pull a profit the investors will put us in jail. So we're about to open
the store to the public. But before we do that, I
just wanna show you around. We got some headsets, PlayStation
fours, Xboxs, Nintendos. It's a lot of really expensive things. Psych. It's all free. All right, guys. We're
about to let the sign down. - Strike.
- Yes. - A monsoon is about to occur. Chandler, cash register.
- Yeah. - Chris, floor. Garrett, floor. Ty, you just be Ty. We don't care. Just be happy. That's all we want in life. Torique and Hannah, grab the camera. All right. And it's
time to unlock the door. Chandler, are you ready? - I'm ready. - Don't be nervous. - Gay me. Hello. - Welcome to the store. - Thank you. - What would you like? - Everything. - It's a drone. - Or, blackened bananas. - Take the bananas. - Bananas? You guys are gross. Little bananas. - It's a steal. - Take the bananas. - Okay. I'll take the bananas. - Banana sale. - Instead of taking something expensive he just took bananas. - Since you picked out
the bananas, you get $500. - We didn't want these rotten bananas and we didn't wanna throw 'em
away. So here's $500, man. Oh, my gosh. Your bananas
stink. They're delicate. - Make some good banana bread. - Echo dot. Have one item and

thousand grams of sugar. Guys, keep this up and I promise
the investors will be happy and you won't lose your jobs. - Thank you. - Wait. So you're about to graduate? - Yeah. - What's up, man? - How doing, buddy? - Go grab whatever you want. It's free. - I almost missed my graduation. - You missed your

Get outta here. - Stay out. - It's okay. We won't let anyone else
bring money in here. Bring in a huge hoard. Hey, come on in. Go get 'em, Ty. Marcus, go get 'em. There we go. Oh wow. We
let it in a lot of people. - We have egg makers. - I got you. I got you. I'll sell this egg maker. I've been trying to
sell this all day. Okay? - Sell that egg maker. - Hey guys. Anybody who likes eggs? - Oh, my God. - Electric egg cooker. - An electric egg cooker. Instead of you cooking the eggs the electric will cook the egg. This is the most expensive
thing in the store. This is an electric egg cooker. - I'll take it. - You're taking it? Yes, dude. I've been trying to
sell this all day. Thank you. - Come on in, guys. You look like you want a spoon. - Posters on the wall are signed. - What have you done for this store? I've sold the clothes off my back. This is like my fourth shirt. - I funded it. - I thought the investors funded it. Get your story straight. - All right, guys. As you
see, we sold everything. - Yeah! - You're probably curious how we did. So here's a little graph right here. - Yeah. The blue line is where
we were before the store. And now that we sold
everything, it's below zero. - It's like a rollercoaster. - So that means we have
no money in the bank. But, we probably made
a lot of money today, so Francesca, come open the cash register. You guys just stay here. How much money is in here? Okay. 60 to $70,000 later, and
we made 10 clothes-pins and half a piece of gum. - Yeah. - I think your jobs are safe. And, yeah, hopefully we can
do this in a few months. Oh, yeah. Our investors did
want us to plug the merch. - The investors said we wouldn't be able to
do another free store unless we had promoted the merch. - Okay. So is that the new MrBeast
backpack on ShopMrBeast.com? - Yep. It's for school. It's for the pool. It's for being cool. - Oh. my God. - What else do we sell on ShopMrBeast.com? - T-shirts, and hoodies, and
bracelets, and maybe socks. - Whoa. Like that sexy shirt? Oh, do you have a sexy shirt on? Ty, sexy shirt. All this is for available
at ShopMrBeast.com. Look at all these hoodies right here. They all look really good. If you guys don't buy
merch, I can't pay Ty. - Aw. - So it's because of Ty now? - All right, there we go. ♪ MrBeast six thousand ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ ♪ MrBeast six thousand ♪ ♪ Yeah, you know his name ♪ ♪ He changed it once or twice ♪ ♪ But I think it's here to stay ♪
