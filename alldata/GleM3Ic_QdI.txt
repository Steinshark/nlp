ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Chess World Cup 2023. the World Cup of football is by far the greatest Global sporting event I watched the entire thing last year and for chess it's kind of the same thing it's obviously not as big but it's very very fun to watch the best players in the world take on the young rising stars from all over the globe and lose to them and that's exactly what we are going to see in today's video it's the round of 32 in the open it's the round of 16 in the Women's World Cup uh and this is the only tournament that Magnus Carlson has never won and I got news for you it ain't looking too good right now in this round he took on the German youngster he's I keep calling him a youngster but he's probably like 20 years old at this point but he's been young his whole career to me uh and his name is Vincent kaima uh and uh well I that's all and I'm gonna show you a bunch of other games it's gonna be a fun little chess Sports Center if you will by the way real quick much love to those of you who ordered a signed pre-assigned copy and pre-ordered this uh they sold out 4 000 copies sold out uh pre-orders for the new book are past ten thousand ten thousand people have put in a book order uh and uh the book is still coming out in about two and a half months so just thank you thank you thank you thank you I've been told that if we hit 15 000 it it it it drops on the market as a bestseller can you imagine that would be pretty cool um so appreciate you all very much don't get the book If shipping is forty dollars to your country just wait a little bit it'll it'll be out there soon uh Vincent Begins the game against Magnus with D4 we have Knight to F6 uh Vincent doesn't have a clock uh he does he he absolutely does have a clock there we go I know some some yeah he he is playing with a timer fantastic timer Gotham you're so funny C4 E6 and we have Knight C3 and uh Vincent invites a uh uh because uh Magnus just had a game with white where you know he played you know he was white he played into an IM so but Magnus plays D5 now just a quick note here this is inaccurate now I'm not correcting magnus's play but what I am saying is if you're going to play that setup of E6 D5 Knight F6 there is no reason to start with Knight F6 so something happened essentially the move d4 was played Magnus didn't want to go D5 he didn't want to go D5 because he thought against this move order in particular you know he would not like to end up here because this is considered slightly better for white white can take at an exchange Queen's Gambit decline um but Magnus did this and probably I would imagine that he was expecting Knight F3 I don't know he was probably expecting Knight F3 I because after Knight C3 you play the nimso you play this move order to play Bishop B4 but Magnus goes for D5 anyway which is very interesting we saw this approach taken by uh ding Legion in his match against yanyupomichi in the world championship aren't you obviously don't remember that because you're right you don't remember anything let alone what you even had for breakfast uh me neither by the way that's not an insult to you we have take take Bishop G5 and now historically people have played C6 put the bishop on E7 or D6 uh put the bishop on F5 or put the Knight on D7 this is just a pure exchange Queen's Gambit declines one of the most classic historic openings that exists the Magnus plays Bishop to B4 which is a move but it's also not a move does that make sense no okay uh you're not supposed to play so actively because you're like you're supposed to address the pin that's just that's just the meta but Magnus makes the meta like essentially you follow the openings that get played I follow the openings that get played Magnus plays a new opening suddenly everyone's like oh damn I didn't think about that so E3 H6 and this getting the Bishops out no castling Queen B3 looks pretty powerful not the best move because of Knight C6 if this take Rook B8 holds up so uh Bishop D3 uh take take Vincent plays Knight E2 that's interesting why did Vincent play Knight E2 and not Knight F3 great question uh probably wants to support the Knight and go there and there and that's the idea uh once again if you hear any background noise my neighbors downstairs have been doing construction for now two months we were promised one week it's now on week eight no no problems though and uh it every day it just sounds like they're doing some crazy stuff I don't know I don't know what they're doing uh it sounds like they today it sounds like they have a a power washer on the ceiling what it sounds like um I don't know if you can hear it anyway Knight E2 is uh the move that he chose because he probably wants to develop his Knight to one of those squares and Knight F3 looks very natural but he didn't like it for a reason Knight H5 now he says no Magnus you can't have my Bishop if you'd like my Bishop you need to play the move F6 which would be a fatal mistake because I would take your knight then I won't go here so Knight D7 H3 players go back to normal position and here we go Magnus plays rookie a 15 moves have been made completely equal position but Vincent is down 23 minutes on the clock that's how it goes so Rook C1 couple of things about this position Vincent has what's called a minority Pawn structure he has three pawns versus four minority of Pawns and you can minority attack you can play B4 and try to do things over here you could also try to maybe play for E4 Magnus wants to control this he would love to put a knight on D6 in many situations as well but that can sometimes be difficult he would like to fight back uh and uh well let's see there's B4 right now Knight G3 he's trying to put his Knight on F5 and now we have a trade of Bishops he doesn't take the queen because it's check and now there's no Bishops and this is the position so Vincent is now down 45 minutes on the clock it's a very bad situation very bad situation and he just has to retreat out of magnus's position and and essentially the dynamic the dynamic of this game is Magnus is sitting there going come get me Vincent is sitting there going should I go get him I'm down 45 minutes on the clock I am clearly not familiar with the structure very well and now here comes Magnus with A5 I mean Magnus playing A5 is him saying I'm gonna be you like you're it's adorable that you've made it this far in the world cup but you're trash and I'm gonna win now uh but Vincent plays Queen B1 spends another six minutes and plays Queen B1 and is now down 50 minutes on the clock he has 20 minutes to make 17 more moves that is not a lot of time it's really not Magnus though is in an equal position so he has to keep enough tension here that it can kind of last him into the end game Knight B6 gives away this puts his Knight on C4 now this is hanging but this is basically a trapped Queen so Queen B4 is played instead Rook A5 but here Vincent sees Knight takes D5 that is a sick move and I think from far away that was Vincent's entire idea his entire idea was to take put his Queen on B4 obviously hoping for a trade to preserve his extra pawn and when Magnus goes here it looks like the position for white is about to fall apart but Knight takes D5 takes a pawn that's defended by four different pieces because the Knight hits it the queen hits it the pawn hits it The Rook hits it everybody hits it but nobody can take successfully if you take with the Rook I take the Knight if you take with the pawn I take the Knight and I hit the queen and the Rook is guarding the Queen the pawn can take the Rook but the queen would take the queen but if the queen takes the queen then The Rook takes the queen so Knight takes same story I would go here but that's still completely fine but Magnus gets to this position and now Vincent just offers him a trade of queens and I got news for you Vincent's not going anywhere 40 something minutes down doesn't matter he has a cluster of Five Pawns nice and healthy and Rook B1 Rook B7 is just gonna pressure and Magnus can't do a whole lot so Magnus now starts kinda she's kind of just waiting will Vincent may be given to the pressure Vincent plays G4 nice move trades off AG displays Rook A2 we go to a rook and Knight end game and now Magnus just does what any individual would do he starts bringing his King and Vincent pushes Pawn to G5 he pushes Pawn to G5 to restrict this Knight a little bit and take a little bit of space you never know you never know if you're gonna have to take space away from your opponent you'll notice Vincent hasn't rushed with the move Knight D6 because simply Rook B1 right that's self-explanatory but in this position Magnus plays Knight C7 and you may not realize it yet but Knight C7 according to high depth stockfish is plus four for white Magnus played Knight C7 clearly intending some sort of reroute clearly thinking that after Knight D6 he still had Rook to B1 but now Rook F5 is very powerful and he must have been relying on King to E7 but there is Knight F7 and he must have thought about King E6 but just something like this and Vincent's just winning like you could try to play B5 but I'm gonna go G6 you can try to play B4 I'm gonna go Knight G5 check and I got news for you I'm fast enough to go here it looks like you're queening Knight E4 check and my knight comes back and I take this and I'm just in great shape also you're just gonna lose a knight so all of a sudden Knight to D6 and Magnus has to Chuck upon and Vincent happily goes to a rook end game actually a night on game he trades the Rooks now it's night and four versus knight in three but it's not really Knight in three it's night and two and the random cousin that she's doing God knows what would their career that comes back to a family gathering once every you know half a decade King E8 and now Vincent just goes forward and forward and comes back with the King to centralize it but he keeps pushing look at this just a beautiful cluster of fawns now Vincent's heartbeat is going to do oh my God I'm gonna beat Magnus Carlson Vincent Vincent kymer has never beaten Magnus Carlson In classical chess Knight H5 he defends the pawn brings back the Knight centralizes the king where is he going to go forward he goes forward all his pawns are going forward King D4 and E5 on the way he's gonna push the king back and win this Pawn gonna push everybody forward four on two is going to win all he has to do is not lose the two pawns for the night King and Knight vs king is not winnable King D4 Knight E5 magnus's pawns are falling he goes forward he runs forward but the Knight is coming back just in time to threaten B2 Knight C4 check and ladies and gentlemen the streak of Magnus Carlson not winning a World Cup may continue as in this position he resigned to Vincent kaimer and you see Vincent's rating there is listed as 2701 but when this tournament started back in July July 30th to be exact Vincent was not yet 2700. this is magnus's second time losing to a player just below 2700. in the last like seven or eight years like this is not a result that frequently happens and it can only happen in the World Cup because the young players that are 26 80 26 90 27 10 that don't have a chance to usually play top level chess are playing with top level chess players and there here they are the first time that Vincent played Magnus was grenke in 2019 I think 2020. that was crazy that was so many years ago it would be 2021 I don't even remember I think it was 2019. look how far Vincent has come and he is now putting Magnus on the verge but tomorrow Magnus does have the white pieces it is not yet over now Hikaru versus Prague all right we gotta take a look at Hikaru everybody because he and Magnus are the two most famous chess players on the planet we want to follow their games and if you don't want me to look at their games first you're lying to yourself I see these comments sometimes like why do you always feature Magnus and me core first because they're famous because they're really really famous what like what would he yeah sorry get famous I'll cover your games too no problem this is the first time that Hikaru and Prague have played a classical chess game against each other they have played Blitz they have played rapid they've played bullet they've played everything but they've never played classical chess because Hikaru is a professional streamer and Prague is a professional usually classical chess player so we have an English opening from Hikaru uh Prague strikes in the center with Pawn to D5 Hikaru plays Bishop G2 develops and in this position Prague actually lost the pawn uh he allowed Bishop takes Knight followed by Knight takes Pawn but this is kind of insane uh for white to do to lose the English bishop and give black all the light squares so Hikaru just castles and we have a relatively normal position after 10 moves each clearly both players know what they're doing still hikara now plays this move F4 trying to mobilize the structure uh Prague Not Afraid capture is not afraid of bringing out the bishop because now the bishop is getting slapped backwards the bishop finishes his development over there and akikar plays E4 and proc plays B5 so both players have made it out of the opening with with pretty strong knowledge of the position uh and uh Prague I think at this point started thinking on his own played Bishop D7 and played Rook B8 and played B5 Hikaru on a central approach and Prague on a queen side approach and me uh moving my feet around because my microphone wire got tangled uh Hikaru grabs the bishop Prague not afraid that Bishop was garbage anyway it literally had no prospects for the future and Prague plants a knight firmly in the center of the board and says he caught borrow do your worst you have the two Bishops you're supposed to like empty space I have Knights I like outposts I like controlling the position like this what are you going to do all right Hikaru mobilizes the Army prog smacks everything in the center of the board Prague does not have a dark squared Bishop so it helps him a lot that four of his six pawns are on dark squares five of his six pawns are on dark squares do you see light squares dark squares that's the way it works you don't have a dark squared Bishop you want to seal the gaps all right it's like a it's like a concrete in a in a construction project right you want to seal the Gap see a car replace Rook C1 proc plays Rook C8 here plays H3 and you'll notice that hikaru's time management he thinks for 20 minutes and plays the move H3 of course there were many many variations that he was calculating here it's just a very difficult position it's very tough to break proc setup here now proc plays Bishop B5 Hikaru tries to play G4 proc comes back to get the bishop and at this point proc has his biggest advantage of the game just clearly better with the black pieces but that doesn't mean much you could be clearly better Hikaru no longer has a uh Bishop pair and Hikaru has five of his pawns on light squares with a light squared Bishop so clearly some positional problems here now if Hikaru was playing stockfish if stockfish was playing Black it would win it would I mean it would win no matter what but my point is that it would exploit this advantage in a much more sophisticated and fine-tuned way uh but Prague is a human and just like most humans here he's kind of struggling to find his way through and all of a sudden kikaru consolidates prog's time is low and here comes Hikaru uh giving up the pawn on A2 but creating very meaningful pressure against this Pawn on C5 Prague gives the pawn away Hikaru accepts a queen trade we have a rook and Bishop end game here comes hikaru's King Here Comes prague's Pond Here Comes hikaru's Rook Here Comes Brock's Pawn Here Comes hikaru's Bishop Here Comes prog's King Here Comes hikaru's King Rook C7 back and both players make 40 moves it is a very tense position and Hikaru sacrifices The Rook Pawn to C5 if Bishop takes the pawns would go hand in hand and it would be a nightmare to prevent these pawns from going this is actually a very instructive end game lesson this is why you should get my endgame master class because there is a chapter on end game imbalances and how in the end game uh Rooks are not always worth five points and Bishops are not always worth three because in this case oops in the case that uh black would have actually taken this these are not five point Rooks they're just sitting there waiting to get hydraulic pressed so C5 King f8 A3 and a very very tense fight comes to an end on the 46th move as Hikaru plays Rook B6 and offers a draw and Prague accepts because if he gives a check and then drops the bishop back the position is roughly equal very tense Hikaru says I've had enough prog says I've had enough and their very first fight a very tense one comes to a conclusion with the draw now you might sit there and go Levy you usually don't cover draws and I would say get famous and I will cover your draws as well this was a very very fun one tomorrow we might have a winner or a loser or they will play some tie breaks uh there was only one winner today in the women's side it was relatively peaceful but this game was like the cops were waiting for the winner of this game the police because this was uh this was a a Queen's Gambit declined where white gave away the pawn on Seafort and black played this line B5 which is a very interesting move uh intending to deflect the Knight away and then Knight B6 I imagine would stabilize this Pawn then black would play Bishop B7 Bishop B4 and try to fight against White Center it's you could take this but uh I'm not sure you want to give away this I'm not sure you want to get yourself in a position where your structure is kind of ruined and black will castle and you know this is I don't know I I don't exactly know what the preparation was but um humpy conuru Grand Master from India plays A4 and she kind of wasted a little bit of time in the opening she she rerouted her Knight and and wanted to get a perfect moment to take on C4 and she got it but at the cost of the E4 Pawn I mean yes she got that but now here's the problem this is a textbook lesson oh in the next two games I'm going to show you are just also incredible um this is a textbook lesson of how to attack a person whose pieces are not yet developed and whose King is stuck in the center all right here we go Bishop D5 there's something in chess called an initiative an initiative is a set of moves that creates threads and simultaneously improves your position in the long run so the move Bishop D5 attacks the queen forces it to move and opens up the B file which white uses which black uses immediately so now that move creates a threat on the queen that move creates a threat on the queen so the Queen's gotta make a move away from the B file but keep guarding the bishop it goes there now seeing that the B4 square is free Bishop to B4 check so black develops the bishop to the center black develops The Rook to the open file black develops the bishop with check white now has to go King E2 because if y tries to go here and tie their shoes together the queen is what we call overloaded it's defending this as defending this so it'd be 90 92 Bishop D2 Bishop D2 this has to guard this but I also has to guard that so you have to go here now Rook B2 boom and you lose so pumpy Conor now can't Castle the attack continues Knight takes C4 Bishop takes E4 forcing the queen here black castles because white can't Castle let's say white is going to play Rook D1 here in King F1 King here Bishop C2 forces The Rook back so Knight E5 but now we continue the initiative C5 we keep pounding away at White's position because white has three pieces that haven't gotten a chance to participate D takes now Queen C7 hits the Knight immediately hits the bishop and now the Rook is going to come here this is ridiculous Knight G4 she gives up the night she gets this initiative F5 a brilliant move you're giving up a pawn with a check but taking it as poison to White's position so white has to go Queen F4 black says no Queen trade white develops the bishop finally but now take take and now the cool calm collected King to h8 and do you know what the idea of King h8 is you're trying to glitch off the map you're trying to get out of the pin so you could play Pawn to E5 and that's exactly what she does and she goes E4 as well to take away squares from all of White's pieces and then she goes F4 this entire game was played with the foot on the gas Rook D5 F3 check the King is worth more than the queen takes takes Queen F3 very classy move if you take my queen I will take yours but black goes back to E7 opposite color Bishops favor the attacking side white is just moments away from potentially consolidating but it's just not fast enough the queen it's The Rook The Rook gets the chance to move another queen comes in from this angle and the Rooks can't block the Queen's Jack because of the bishop on B4 which was placed there so long ago the King has to walk out and it's a murderous absolutely murderous assault on this King The Rook gets taken white has to give up a lot of material and it's just a matter of time until humpikanuru resigns Pawn to A6 a very sophisticated move Bishop A6 deflects the bishop into a geometric check and black one from the get-go from this position this is a master class in what we call initiative centralize the bishop take the open file give a check glue your pieces together and activate your queen chop down hit the queen castle Knight goes here strike at the center get your queen up trade in hit the queen queen takes Queen takes Pawn hitting the bishop in the pawn it was just it was just non-stop it was absolutely non-stop also uh you might have just heard the windows noise I didn't hear it because my headphones are plugged in but sorry that was not your computer that was that was me you know they always want you to update everything and anyway um I do apologize for uh for for for those of you who I might have disrupted beautiful game I got two more games for you and uh both of these games were uh unbelievable so first of all uh we have uh we have the game Wesley so versus Alexa Serana um this is this is a kraken game Wesley so has had a very difficult World Cup like literally in every round he has had a disaster of a position by the way my friends does this look familiar yeah that's looks familiar because a couple of uh yeah because because there it is it's the exact same position that you just had on Magnus Carlson's board but saranic plays castles instead of Bishop F5 and then he plays like this and um please B6 now Wesley has had a difficult position in multiple openings Bishop to B5 played by Wesley hitting the Knight and for another time in this event he is in a position where he he just does not have any advantage uh I haven't shown a Wesley game yet but he's struggling he's struggling and the commentators have picked up on it he's been able to defend himself but it's been very difficult and Alexi just goes horse to Center horse to Center and uh and takes the bishop horse to the center takes the bishop and now he's going to go Knight E4 probably or D4 to open up the bishop uh this is called the hanging Pawn structure white tries to attack on C5 D5 maybe B4 stuff like this Rook C8 and um there's D4 the door has been opened and Serana looking nasty from the diagonals trades The Rook gets closer with the Knight he's utilizing everybody every one of his pieces is being used right now while this Knight is kind of just eating hay on the edge of the board Queen F5 the Knight comes back and there it is takes out the queen Knight comes back in Wesley takes a pawn and you know what how they say you don't want to trade Queens when you're attacking yeah not if you're Alexi serrana Knight to F4 you know why Knight to F4 because this bishop is a is just a killer Knight E2 is threatened but my friends it's not even 92. it's Pawn to H3 the bishop will open up the king's oxygen tank 92 will be mate Knight C7 hits the rook and the bishop you know what's worth more than both of those pieces the king you could take my Rook Knight E2 and pawn takes G2 is mate H3 Knight G3 Pawn takes G2 Knight to H3 is checkmate so he goes here and Alexi serrana the absolute madman does not take back the Knight just place here and white is helpless the king cannot break out of his prison if he plays F3 to try to go here D2 is too fast and rookie one is even faster King F2 G1 be sh mate and that is why after D3 Wesley so resigned Alexi Serrano just beat a 2770 rated player with the black pieces Vincent kymer just beat Magnus Carlson and I got another one for you vidit Gujarati of India versus Etienne bakra of France this was a crazy game it was a Sicilian Defense taimanov we don't see this a lot at top level Knight B5 that is a rare move Knight B5 is a very rare move why does playing Bishop E3 Bishop E2 all of these different lines Knight B5 attacking the queen and then what we just developed like it's nothing we are trying to get A6 so we could take this and then drop back well back row is like no and now we just develop and we basically just and there it is there's a six finally now this is the position and in this position well same side attacking chess I talked about the endgame's master class you should get the middle games master class as well same side attacking chess Pawn to F4 this is how you start an attack in chess Pawn to B5 striking back a wedge in the center preventing the easy communication of all of these pieces together opening this up opening this up rook F3 Rook Rook H3 this is called a rook lift F5 Knight E4 Bishop E3 everybody's coming to the party have a real good time C5 F5 on the board F5 is giving up the pawn on E5 he's offering Queen E5 to his opponent because after Queen F3 The Rook is hit and if the Rook slides over there's Bishop F4 and if the Rook slides to A7 there is no Bishop F4 but it's still the best move because after Queen D4 Rook D1 you have a massive initiative what did you think I was gonna say Knight takes E5 Pawn to F6 vidit gives up not one but two bonds F6 the point is it looks like Black's position is completely stable but if you do that he would have sacrificed The Rook Pawn takes F6 Bishop takes H7 he would have walked in with a baseball bat and smashed everything made of glass and marble in Etsy and back rose house King takes H7 Queen to H5 and it is Checkmate in 24 moves 94 Knight D7 Bishop to H6 and mate is just coming because Queen G4 Queen G7 black would have to sacrifice his Queen and then you know blah blah blah blah blah blah and then we would get a Checkmate F6 G takes F6 the attack roared forward vidit gave away two pawns but he had all the pieces ready to go and when it was time he sacrificed the bishop the Greek gift giving away the bishop to bait the king out into the open that girl said no running home but here comes the queen he sacrifices Rook for a defensive measure the King has made it to his home square but the bishop came back the bishop came back to attack the rook and allow the queen into the territory Bishop B7 trading the Bishops but the Knight replaces the bishop hitting the dark squares now Knight to G6 Knight to F6 check the king continues to run the king continues to run and the King will run oh the king is gonna run away my friends he really will unfortunately he's gonna leave all the rest of the pieces to absolutely perish and in this position the simple Retreat out of the territory Black's position absolutely decimated vid it up three points of material in the form of one pawn and a rook for a bishop macro could play on because actually vidit only has three minutes to make 10 moves but Petro resigns it resigns because well he's a gentleman he could have played a few more moves um but uh vidid got him and my goodness did he ever vidit played F4 indicating I would like to attack you and uh that is exactly what he did he played E5 he played F5 he played F6 and he said take all of my pawns because me giving away those Pawns opens the doors for the rest of my pieces I hope you enjoyed today's recap uh the World Cup is a tremendous amount of fun half of the top 20 seeds have been eliminated Anish giri has been eliminated of Azerbaijan have been eliminated and the tournament is held in Azerbaijan in Baku they are the Local Heroes they have both been eliminated so many many of the world's top 20 players are no longer in the field the top four still are Magnus Hikaru Fabiano caruana and yaniponushi but Magnus Carlson is on the verge of not returning for the fourth time in four attempts at winning the World Cup it's crazy stuff I'll see you in the next recap uh get out of here and thank you for buying the book
