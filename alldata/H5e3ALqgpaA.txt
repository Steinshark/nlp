my inbox is full of opportunities to review everything from furnace filters to off-brand smart locks to an endless Army of bluetooth speakers and Battery Banks and usually I ignore all of it but for the last month we have indiscriminately said yes to everything for two reasons number one is that we're hoping to find some incredible Diamonds in the Rough number two everything else is going to be really funny hey Optimus be cool he's supposed to reply to you hey Optimus roll out Optimus kicking things off then is the Transformers Optimus Prime Elite core Edition from robosen hey Optimus everything roll out this is the Transformer toy that you dreamed of as a kid I love him whoa there's all kinds of actions oh my God you can even add custom actions you can make your own by doing like a block diagram of each motor and what position you want it to be in let's be cool Optimus you don't have to do anything to be cool hey Optimus Prime roll out build Redux tired of choppy performance and inconsistent frames build Redux will level up your gaming experience with a new pc built to your specs and shipped directly to your doorstep make the Ultimate Gamer move and check them out at the link below the price 700 US Dollars that's a lot of money for a tickle me robo but I mean for a kid even a 45 year old kid this is a pretty out of this world toy I would say the words hey Optimus Prime roll out can you not next up we've got the phone that swallowed your phone holy crap this thing is thick it's got everything type c for charging got your lock and volume control got your sim and micro SD expansion oh still no headphone jack is this just a battery case on top of another phone it looks like it's over molded over a regular Sim slot so many cameras AI music what is AI music this has an iPhone screen protector on it it has a cutout for the Notch and it's like not the right size for it what the hell like this is a weapon of course its claim to fame is not the actually surprisingly decent looking screen or over 10 000 milliamp hour battery but rather the 123 decibel speaker that is sticking out in a giant wart off of its back according to one chart that is just two decibels lower than pain begins well it's definitely painful yeah yeah not because it's particularly loud though I mean credit where credits do it's allowed for a phone but it has AI music on the back twice how could it fail us yeah once you go past about 60 it just completely loses any semblance of balance it's only 150 bucks though but it comes with a mediatek helio a22 dimensity chipset so it's a four core from 2018. four gigs of RAM and Android 12. and I would sincerely doubt that you will ever get any kind of update beyond that took a while to launch the app oh you know hey it's David oh David makes David looks good on any camera not on this one sorry oh that's pretty rough yeah yeah no no it's not Dave it's not the problem it's not going to be any better with me yeah could use more smoothing yoga supposed to use the same soap that you use on your body for your face right just different soaps next up is apparently some RC cars which are ah kobotix you can get red blue silver black or nothing and then you just paint it yourself each car comes with a headset oh no way these are first person view with headset cars 149.99 oh wait it's only you actually nailed it did I really they're 150 each wow cool let's try it here we are a day later and we have finally got a direct Wi-Fi connection between the phone in here and the car right there and that's not bad in terms of latency I mean it's not amazing no it's usable well maybe I guess I should try driving it Oh Trace oh God put it in front of your head and then it'll be your vision I'm gonna oh oh that's actually brilliant it's only a little better oh okay okay if I if I accidentally tilt it it feels like the whole world is falling away from me oh okay don't get sick now we have the rest of the video to make what's the range on this thing like man I'm I'm way I'm on the TechLink set you're on the tech accent and you can see just fine I mean it's a little blocky I I wouldn't describe it as just fine engine is cool down with the and performance oh hi Adam hello there you go oh God that's so nauseating why would you do that to me I'm sorry you cannot navigate this thing at full speed need highlighters I have two different takes on this one as a tech reviewer who knows that this is a lot of technology for 150 bucks I'm like wow that's really impressive but from a this is my real money that I actually paid and this is the experience I get standpoint why don't we talk about the laser yeah about this the comments on Yvonne's AMD ultimate Tech upgrade made it pretty clear that without an extraction hood and a tinted cover basically shouldn't use these because at best you might go blind and at worst you might inhale some bad stuff and I don't know go blind go dead yeah our health and safety committee said no oh we can't even turn it on they said please don't this is a class 4 laser which means that even Reflections can cause permanent eye damage what about these glasses those I believe are not properly rated so he said no they look cool though I mean go ahead just say taste is subjective cool okay and how much is this thing two thousand dollars and are we covering it on short circuit tynan's gonna do a full coverage of it that's a weird way to say that how about something that's a little bit more Down to Earth this is the gravistar Supernova it's a Bluetooth speaker and lamp I mean you know what I kind of like it stoil the plastic molding and the intricate paint is actually really well done it's a really cool knick-knack and the RGB is also relatively tasteful um I mean yeah I think it looks really cool it's got like that vacuum tube or Nixie tube kind of vibe to it yeah and you can change the settings we have three different RGB settings I guess if you include office for bonus features on your phone that's a really cool speaker it sounds okay but because it's a down firing speaker it really depends on the surface you put it on and I found any sort of soft surface completely muffles it and it sounds a lot better holding it it still doesn't sound very good dude are you a base head by any chance no not really but okay because that's the only way that I could save it sounds anything other than like butt I've heard a lot of a lot worse Bluetooth speakers here's something that I didn't understand about this because it was prominently featured in their marketing materials it comes with a hook a hook so you can be that guy I know they're like put it on your backpack in style I mean these legs are not super you know hanging off of a bag friendly yeah I know they'll just get caught on stuff how to be a tool and look like one too just have this hanging off your backpack while you're hiking play music to keep the bears away but is a little bit more bag friendly is there cute little Gan nitride charger what does that have to do with anything he's small and he's a charger yeah I mean okay how much is this thing I'm guessing 250 bucks 180. yeah okay it's a hundred dollar knick-knack with a forty dollar speaker in it and you pay 40 bucks for having both of them in one package there is so much stuff oh yeah I know man this could be three videos or we'll have a bunch of extras on flowplane.com LTT okay this is a laptop stand ing maybe with a laptop on it it's pretty cool will hey that's on there it didn't like what what is this this is the echo itx-05 13 in one full stack docking station full stack that's full stack Man full stack it's got the bottom and the top of it it's a type c dock with a speaker in it and a DAC I was actually really looking forward to this thing because this is like the exact perfect thing that would fit on my desk has amp deck combo in here can power some of the headphones that I listen to whoa okay that's pretty cute dual display quad USB type A you get a couple of usbcs there's a power delivery input so that you can actually charge your laptop while it's connected to it ethernet and then of course if it's a DAC it's going to have a headphone jack and then also a balanced output and Optical no microphone Jack so that's a yikes what is the deal with this port up in the top I think is this is this the intended use case that really doesn't seem right wireless charging it's got this what is this I thought maybe headphones that's the only guess I literally have no idea headphones then it would be female no I mean like uh your airpods charging case or not your airpods but my case is Too Tall oh I can get it oh sorry but also we can listen to some Hi-Fi headphones oh Hi-Fi headphones from what is this brand how blatantly did they rip off the B from banging olives I was saying oh a faux leather carrying cake wow those are loud design wise they're quite loud does it come with any other size of ear it does that's the default ear tips yeah I mean they're very very large for default maybe they're like a Holland focused company do they sell a lot into Holland well they're just in the house no they're just like really tall there I figure if they're tall they might have big ear canals I mean I'm tall and my ear canals are very small my doctor says I'm an Abomination they include so many ear tips what are these made of are these just like a resin mold it's a wood shut up yeah well it's got to be some kind of resin impregation resin cured wood sure okay um so it's resin I mean with wood in it yeah but the actual Interiors would too it's not if you think they have a lot of ear tips just wait till you hear how many drivers they have seven there's nine in each here but that would explain why they're so big it has four balanced armatures four electrostatic tweeters and one 9.2 millimeter Dynamic driver they go in like that it took me a little while to figure it out oh that's unintuitive so David you said you like the look do you still like the look why does it happen if you have them wrong there's no way that's right the cable was on backwards I like how they look I like it I like the Jade kind of aesthetic I can tell you they have excellent noise isolation like I don't need active noise cancellation on something that's that much of an ear plug it has the thing look shut up I use it no I agree a cinch is awesome helps a lot I know it looks ridiculous but it really does help a lot this is one of those products that's either a hundred and twenty dollars from some weird Chinese brand or is like two thousand dollars and I have no idea which one I'm looking at right now plug into our balanced Jack here what kind of DAC doesn't have a volume knob a touch screen deck wait hello they sound great I know right they sound really good they're pretty uncomfortable I'm not gonna lie because they don't really sit inside your ear they're basically just hanging all this weight off of your ear canal 7.99 you're pretty close 8.99 okay okay I'm trying to unplug this and this whole piece of the deck is like coming apart I mean I guess you don't want your balance Jack to be too loose what about the price for this guy 199 476 oops nope see you later I hope you weren't listening to that music too loud because you could lose your hearing uh no I was okay in the event that you do you can try the liner Nova yeah because when you're as old as this guy that's the time to start protecting your hearing I mean Life Starts from hearing why oh they look cool though these definitely look like ripoff airpod that is speaking of hearing damage that is Extremely Loud on each bud there's a tube okay oh okay I'm out ow they're for people that are hard of hearing yeah yeah so at level one you're unpleasant yeah yeah yeah oh and then this is just USBC power aux in so you could hook it up to your TV or whatever exactly and these bridge the gap between wireless earphones and and a hearing aid type product I guess yeah to their credit for an off-brand airpods clone this is actually a pretty compact case have we listened to music on them do they they're not audiophile headphones but like decent and then I'm gonna pop and then how does it can you hear me really well now uh oh oh okay it took a second but yeah it's kicked in I can hear myself I found that if I do like all right oh whoa what was in this ear and then it was so I think what it's trying to do is that if it goes you hear a really loud bang on your left it's not trying to boost it so that you get deaf and your left ear yeah it's can't take it out but it's really sensitive so that if I do this you hear I can hear the echo yeah it's not the snap yeah because of the delay I can tell it's the echo off that wall interesting it's canceling this ear because it's going oh that's a loud noise yeah it's not that this has got to be like 500 bucks 407 I could see people buying this and being extremely happy with it oh it's time for a door lock door lock Cheeto these guys don't exist on Amazon anymore oh so I'm assuming it's just like a quick in and out weird okay but if they were then you would put this cable through this hole and we can get batteries in there right whoa It's on wait oh God why would you want it to be like that is this are you are you intended to put it on the door like this there's a USB micro b in the end of this handle but it uses AAA batteries but you can connect it to an app what does that have to do with the micro b USB port I don't know factory resetting it I'm trying to find that is this a fingerprint sensor though it is I would definitely trust this with my fingerprints oh if the batteries are drained and you don't have your key you can just plug in a battery Bank to power it temporarily not it's it's a solution hey it's a handheld gaming PC A-Okay Zoe hahaha well how the hell am I supposed to pronounce that dicks wow ryzen 6000 play some GTA 5 boys boom that was all it had while these joysticks are nothing special neither is this deep oh that d-pad is truly awful especially awful what is this a keyboard shortcut just do yourself a favor and enable the real keyboard down here and then just touch it down here it's a lot better this is really annoying I can't even select this text field oh the password I can but the account I can oh it has RGB though look at this the handles are glowing the handheld gaming on Windows truly is an unfinished experience that is valve's big Advantage right now uh oh [Music] and it's gone the software is really really bad well it's non-existence is what it is yeah I don't [ __ ] care just launch the game Sorry the new version the new version of this console that they're releasing at the same price has is gonna be the first console to market with the 7840u but that's basically the Z1 Extreme God it got it got it okay it's not light but it's pretty ergonomic for the size like it's not hard to hold on to I actually quite like the shape of it micro SD slot two usbcs which is really nice to see that's something you won't find on either the Rog Ally or the steam deck that's pretty looking display not the brightest I've seen and it's a huge eight inches that's really big it's not even that loud it's not quiet quiet like the Ally but it's reasonable okay I mean software aside I don't mind the hardware for this thing and I like the color scheme it's pretty how hard is it for guys like this to compete now that the Rog Ally exists oh no 859 and over twelve hundred dollars for a terabyte of storage and 32 cubes of ram that's the RG allies software not perfect either but it has some they made a battery brand for you cocktek okay to my knowledge nobody has actually had sex with Yvonne since we got married and I certainly didn't watch so no it's just an energy you give off 40 000 milliamp hours though with this kind of big battery energy I mean I don't think she'd look elsewhere there's something sorry are they being cocked or doing the cocking I'm not sure I don't maybe they're just like a cocking technician they're just there for support during the whole event [Laughter] anyway there's a humor to me that this is called the P plus series [Laughter] all right I think we're done here see you later that's okay I'm no longer interested in the price of the cocktek I found me uh much more satisfying meet the Omni charge you can power it up here it's got a little display three USBC outputs one of them is in slash out oh okay that's the charging one does this do USB PD yes it does it also does AC out you can charge it via DC it comes with a wall wart that's again 65 watt charger and the total capacity on this bad boy six thousand four hundred milliamp hours at it at 22 volts oh so if we're talking what most people measure it it's closer to forty thousand millimeters okay about the same as the cut Tech but look at that temperature monitoring and everything on here it has a 100 watt DC in and out so it can save your power brick it also acts as a hub for file transfers I trust it but how much does it cost it costs four hundred and fifty dollars yeah you're paying a lot for those premium features guvis no no wait no I want to do Goofus see you're doing goof is okay you can't put stuff in front of me you're gonna do the goose goggles wait is Goofus a slang I'm not familiar with it's just the stupidest word do I look like a Goombas absolutely this is just one of those personal home theater things right yep okay that's probably about equivalent to a 120 or so inch screen at you know about eight ten feet uh there's a lot of light bleed around it I'll tell you that much and the the flip up doesn't freaking not work at all it just drags it down there's no middle strap so there's nothing to kind of hold it in place there is a clip for a middle strap I actually did I have no idea where that is now that never made it over here apparently let's use a river then yep 42 pixels per degree wow most other brands only have have less than 20 PPD the equivalent of an 800 inch screen it's like sitting at IMAX with 3147 PPI no don't you just you're getting ahead of it you're getting ahead of yourself oh hell wrong with you look look at these ipd adjustments and you can switch between 3D and 2D brightness adjustments and everything this foam not great I'm glad you're having a lot of fun with your Goofus Linus I'm really happy for you but you got it you gotta slow down I work with a child wait look at that what you know what we got the Goofus and a seat oh and I'm dead magnetically removable thing got the padded bolsters which is kind of nice at least the yeah you don't go straight through to the wooden bottom yeah as long as you don't weigh too much this should be reasonably okay this is gaming chairs go this is actually the XL version so it's four people between the heights of five eleven and six eight any feature you can find in the secret lab you can pretty much find on here cool it's a six hundred dollar chair six hundred dollar chair yeah that doesn't surprise me that much given the features the other thing that we got was the sick bracelet this is part of the say yes to everything yeah moza racing I've never heard of them um neither have I but apparently they're actually quite well liked in the racing Community tyvee has given his badge of approval being kind of our resident racing nerd we don't have a little stiff we don't have any weed Embrace this I'll I'll get I got you fam no just just hold on for a second are you kidding this is how we're doing this this is the whole table's moving my chair's on wheels okay casters have you felt the buttons on these this feels freaking amazing what's janky about this nothing actually Moze is actually killing it I was super impressed with everything that they have these joysticks feel amazing wow that screen actually looks pretty good this is kind of awesome okay well we're gonna have the next feedback is kind of freaking awesome my brakes don't work which is less awesome we're gonna add another level to your simulation the feeling of air blowing past you dude what move your head forward what the hell is happening you're about to get air conditioning from your car ah is this that thing we did the sponsor spot for on techwiki because we took a bunch of flack over it but I tried it and it was actually pretty good like this would be helpful on a hot day oh yeah no it works really well I think their talking points were really stupid there's like something something like AI controlled fan whatever the crap that means like that was dumb yeah the actual cooling cannot be denied there's touch and vibration and you can use them as speakers admittedly I don't have a ton of experience with racing wheels I have tried some pretty nice stuff in the past this feels pretty damn nice do you like Mr Bean um tattoo no I can't really be in my place Teddy his Teddy well remember that episode where he brushes his teeth while driving a car so we got a toothbrush yeah an Oral B io9 toothbrush Oral B reached out to us what for editorial yeah okay here you go we're coming in we haven't talked about pricing at all oh hell is wrong with you on that LT store.com there's some water oh okay well I gotta keep these pearly whites looking great okay so as you can see as you brush your teeth it detects how much pressure I'm putting on your teeth you can give a red or green light based on the amount of pressure [Music] okay well let's talk about the overall price of this racing setup and then you can maybe you can guess the allocations I bet this is at least like thirty five hundred dollars but that goobest thing on your head is is nine hundred dollars this is nine hundred dollars yeah for 300 you know they might have my attention this thing's I think like 350 bucks I think I remember that for this 400 yeah which is a lot the racing setup is fifteen hundred dollars total that's it I mean considering that it's 500 bucks for logitech's Cheapo version yeah this is at least three times better than that and then the Oral B toothbrush is 2.99 okay
