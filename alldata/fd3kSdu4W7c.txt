i've just seen you do fingerprint scanning and all sorts of stuff yeah tell me about that it is so we have seven layers of security from the boundary uh fence line all the way through to the it in the rack and what you've just experienced there is the access from what we call the general area operations on the what we turn the fluffy side of the building to the secure side of the building which is where the data holes and all the it infrastructure resides so going through what we call this tube lock circle lock contraption you have to go into the lock itself and put your finger onto the finger vein reader and the finger vein reader rather than just a traditional fingerprint reader actually searching for signs of life so it has to make sure that you haven't had your finger cut off and someone's brought you through so it's quite extreme it does seem a bit over the top but it does give the customers the assurance that it's very difficult to get into the facility and do anything untoward with their i.t okay okay we are going to go into the disk shared data hall so again we've got further security access into here the lights will come on do you want to follow me through so what you see here are various pods with it racks within them and within the racks is all the it infrastructure for each of the customers so we have a number of the anchor customers from the janet consortium in here such as ucl king's college the francis quick institute we also have imperial college i'll take you through some of the pods now this is what's called high performance computing so each of these racks are full with hpc platforms and on the other side is the storage that supports those platforms so this is all utilized for medical research and it's a consortium of ucl the francis crick and the sanger institute so they've come together as a single entity if you like uh through funding um to provide this service and then take called medical research within the building storage is ten petabytes of data and the um the the it load that that's that is supported by is some 190 kilowatts of power this is the single largest installation of its type outside cern right to give you some sort of context of the scale of it so they're very proud of it so once you've got you've got pogs are they all sort of a similar size um it varies depending upon the requirement but what we do have in this room is predominantly high performance computing doing research so you've got king's college over there doing something similar but that's that's our own we have the singers the sangha institute in the far corner doing something similar as well and then we have smaller customers more traditional education organizations that have um traditional business applications such as the london school of economics who are doing their own you know um teaching uh learning uh applications and then their own ic functions for um hr and finance and that sort of thing so it's all it's across the board really it's traditional um traditional uh i.t capability along with the research side so this is uh the king's college installation similar format to what we've seen but this is slightly less powered and they do a number of they do a number of predominantly medical research on their own systems and they've migrated a lot of their infrastructure from their own campus in central london in the strand and one of the key benefits they've seen is that they're not being challenged by the struggles of having this level of i.t infrastructure in central london whereby um there was now there was a big large power outage recently on kingsway in london which meant that their data center went down but by having their data center housed in a location outside central london allowed them to keep these platforms running and also their icu infrastructure running as well we have sagar institute and imperial college in this pod here um again they're doing medical research this is the made by bed bio project it's on a smaller scale to the sanger and ucl and practice quick installation but again this is very high powered infrastructure so the room itself is 500 square meters and it's supported by 750 kilowatts of it load which is the killer wants to support the room from powering the it and then you see those boxes on the wall there those are the computer room air conditioning units they're attached to a pipe work system with cold water that then creates cold air that pushes the cold air underneath the floor and then through those floor grills and then that cold air is then circulated through the itunes structure and out through the rear and then circulated through the crack units again but you're always maintaining a level of temperature within the pod to ensure that the it operates correctly and 247 365. the electricity that supports the ic you've got in effect this is a large wall socket so um that has a lot of power cables that come out the bottom of it that then feed through underneath the floor and then get attached into these power strips which the ic hardware then plug into and you will notice that this one's blue we call it a pdu power distribution unit and then the one over here the one in the corner over there is red and what that means is that each cabinet each it rack has a power feed from the blue units and the red units to a socket under the floor for each providing what we call an a plus b supply so should there be should there be any outage on that side it means that the red side will support the entire it load for that rack and for that item structure there's a very large primary substation at the rear of the building which we paid for which costs a lot of money and that is supported uh by the the power ring that runs around the whole of the slough trading estate and connects into the slough heat and power power station and also the national grid as well and there are two connections from that um power ring that come into the primary substation at the rear of the building and each of those to support up to 40 megawatts of electricity um the idea being is that should one fail then the other one could pick up the entire i.t and falling load of the facility and then alongside that we have a generation a set of generators uh which is which are called contingency rater generators and they are the the engines that go in ships um and they can run uh the building indefinitely as long as we put fuel in them to again provide all the it power for all the i.t technology as well as pooling all that infrastructure as well so the building can run in isolation indefinitely as long as we top up the um the the engines if you like the fuel diesel yeah lots of lots of red diesel so this room is now um pretty much a capacity and we have been building a an additional piece of capacity on the other side of that wall which provides another 2 500 kilowatts of power this is 750 kilowatts of power and we're already moving new customers into that space so both ucl and brunel are going in there and then queen mary will be going in there in the next month or so um but we're very much at the beginning of this the data center development so the building itself um can support 16 000 kilowatts and we've only built out an operational on 2.25 uh sorry 2 200 kilowatts with a further 2 500 kilowatts that have gone live so we've got the ground floor and then this floor above us so there's lots of capacity a lot of them are doing um standard enterprise applications for their email for their um hr or finance systems and for the learning solutions that they provide to their students but the high-powered solutions the high-performance computing is research and that will be across various different avenues of research predominantly in the emad lab system that we just see here that is medical research and king's college focused heavily on medical research as well um so they've been doing some quite interesting things which we can talk about later on but using these platforms to support it but it's the the higher power computing allows them to do research quicker than a standard server which is as simple as it gets really if they all want to use this powerful grid you've created how do you prioritize how is it decided who gets to use the power and when that is very important more than one network connection and there's infinity bands and a control network it's really very comfortable and then with this unit i can walk around now in this room and i'm suddenly in a virtual environment it's an optical tracking system so they're basically
