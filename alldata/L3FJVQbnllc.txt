hi everyone in this episode we're going to be creating a run cycle for our character and also a super simple idle animation so I've got the walk open from last episode and I'm just going to go into frame 1 since this is a fairly good starting point for the first frame of our run animation as well and I will close the walk action create a new run action and just press the F button once again to save it I have made this reference sheet for the run animation so you can see just like with the walk we've got up to contact poses on either side and then they down pose the passing pose and the up pose in between the main difference of course between the walk and the run is that with the run we've got this one pose where both the characters feet are simultaneously off the ground ok let's come in and create our first contact pose so I'm going to bring this foot a little bit further forward and rotate a little bit more I'll of course have to bring the hips down on these axis so that the heel can make contact with the ground there and we'll bring this other leg out just trailing behind like so I'll reset the rotation on the toes there and probably want to rotate the hips if the character is sort of leaning into the run to make it look a little bit more energetic and from front view I'm also going to make the chest swing a little bit more dramatically from side to side so I'll rotate that weight on the z axis and I'm just rotating that counts to that try and keep the head stable then the arms are going to come further up so they're like that perhaps and I just stick the elbow out a little bit more and just rotate the forearm to cross over the body a little bit more I smile bend the elbow here as well a little bit and maybe bring that further back like so that should be just right okay for the first pose just go to try and get the head facing forward a little bit better and then I'll select all the bones press I can set a keyframe and then I'll copy this pose with ctrl C and there's going to be a 8 frame run animation so come forward 8 frames to frame 9 and shift control V and insert keyframe so we've got our to contact poses let's now come to frame 5 for the passing pose so for this pose I will bring the left leg back a bit getting ready to sort of spring off the ground like so bring the hips down a tiny bit and this leg is just going to be passing this of the middle of the character here and set a frame on that and go to the frame 3 for the down position so here this leg or this foot rather is going to be flat on the ground the hips are to be nice and low and it's going to be trailing back a little bit further all right on such frame and then our up pose isn't actually gonna be on frame 7 but rather on frame 8 just before the last frame and this is going to be the highest point but it's not going to be much higher than the contact frame alright let's insert a keyframe and have a look and this is looking okay I think the clothes can maybe go a little bit lower down on this down pose just to try and emphasize the weight of it more and on frame two we of course want the foot curve already slammed down and we can have the toes flopping behind as we did with the walk I'll do the same thing with the toes of the other foot here just have those bending back like so alright and make sure these toes on thinking below the ground just fine-tune that and going through these last frames here just want to make sure that it never goes below or above the ground until frame H so let me keep that on the ground there maybe bend the toes a little bit more okay getting ready to spring up on frame eight here okay I think to really see how this is going we're going to need to copy over the second step so as you hopefully remember from last episode we need to make sure that all of the keyframes he are selected and all of the bones are selected in the dope sheet summary as well and then we can press control C bring the playhead to the last frame frame line and press shift ctrl V alright this is now 17 frames long so we'll set the end frame pH is 16 and let's not press play our circle of the bones and just hide them so we can get a better view here the character's body here is maybe a little bit rigid sort of perhaps a rotate that a bit throughout the run and the head is looking a little bit rigid as well so we can hopefully address those two things and from front view here this is looking okay but I just like the weight of the characters to sort of shift over the leg that's on the ground so those are the three things that we'll be looking at next let's unhide the bones here and I'm going to delete these copied key frames so you can just focus on the first step so I think on this down pose we can maybe rotate the character just a little bit forward and now we have the head come down a little bit as well insert a keyframe and then over here maybe it's not quite back to how it was yet and such a keyframe and then by frame eight it kind of recovered all right his upper body is looking a little less plank like which is nice let's then go into front view I'd like to have it to that as the characters first comes to sort of plant itself on the ground here the weight of the character should shift over that leg so to do this we're going to want to modify the exposition of the hips but it might be a little bit irritating trying to do that with all of these other keyframes for the hips getting in our way now we don't want to just delete those since we have got important information stored in those keyframes like the up-down movement of the hips and the rotation of the hips as well but what we can do is just fold out the hips here and we can delete just the keyframes for the X location of the hips since that's what we want to modify so I'm going to go into a book select and just delete all of these X occasion keyframes between the first and the last and then I'm going to come over on to frame three which is when the foot first is resting completely on the ground here and at this point the weight will be shifted over like so so I'm set a keyframe for that and then after that I'd say friend five the weight should still be over that leg but after that it should start shifting back to the center alright I might have overdone this a little bit so I'm just going to bring it back slightly on the x-axis and I'll shift this over a little bit on frame five as well hopefully this makes the run animation a little bit more lifelike because though the character actually has mass and I think it's sort of managing to sell that illusion so as the final touch let's just make the hands a little bit floppy like we did in the walk animation so coming on to frame three here I'll just rotate the hands up and I'll rotate this hand back like so in such a key frame and that should be okay so let's now select all of this copy and paste and let's play okay I think this is looking alright for now so I'm going to leave the run animation here and focus now on the idle animation so over h to unhide the bones and I'll close out the run animation create a new action called idle and just press the F button as always and then going to frame one I'll reset the pose with alt Arnold G and let's then just set up a slightly natural-looking pol√≠cia bring hips down a bit bring the arms to the sides loosen up the fingers slightly okay then we rotate that down I'll copy this pose for the arm over on to the other side with control C and shift control V and maybe the character will favor one foot so brings his left foot forward a bit rotate that out and olicity is from top view you can just bring this foot back like so and that looks alright for the first frame so I'll select - press I - and set the keyframe and then I'll just go forward a couple of frames say to frame nine and just sort of try to give sort of indication that the character is breathing instead of just standing Stockstill so I'll just move the hips down a tiny bit on the z-axis maybe the arms come out a tiny bit and the fingers can just make a slight gripping motion something like that alright so I'm so to keyframe for that and then I want to copy over this first frame to frame 17 so I'll just right click on the top most keyframe to select the whole column press shift D to duplicate it and just drag it out here to frame 17 so that this is halfway in between and if I press alt a it can cease breathing in and out it's going very rapidly at the moment so what we can do is just scale out the animation to make it slower so I'll select all the keyframes and then s will scale around the playhead so we want to scale from the beginning so let's just skip to the first frame s and skill is up a bunch of times there until the last frame lands on about frame 100 so that's over so set my end frame 1999 and if I press all day to play we can see that the character no longer looks like he's hyperventilating of course this is far from the most exciting animation in the world but it does give some indication that the characters alive all is just standing around so this is where we're going to leave off for this episode and until next time Cheers
