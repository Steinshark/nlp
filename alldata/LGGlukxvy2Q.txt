ladies and gentlemen chess is a very difficult game but getting better at it is rewarding winning chess games feels absolutely fantastic but one of my playlists here on YouTube is called how to lose at chess and this playlist consists as many of you may know and some of you may not a viewer game submissions you guys send games to me I break them down we laugh we cry our stomachs hurt because of what we're seeing and today's game folks I really don't know how to describe it to you um we're going to witness one of the most catastrophic Jazz games I've ever seen when I was reviewing this game that was sent to me by Faraz I I just honestly it never ended like every single plot twist in this game was a shocker okay this was like every good TV drama times a thousand all right uh and I'm gonna share it with all of you and we have uh clocks here as well this was a 15 minute game which is actually going to make this significantly worse let's jump into the action and shout out to uh for us for being a good sport about this by the way so both players are in their 700s they both have Grand Master titles white Begins the game with E4 and already as early as move 2 we have a curious situation for example a lot of you beginners might learn the golden moves which is when you have to put both Central pawns out then Knights then Bishops and so on is white playing a Gambit though because D4 is the beginning of various gambits like Danish Gambit where you give up a couple pawns Goring Gambit now when you are faced with a center Pawn like this the whole point of putting your Pawn in the center is to be able to stop this otherwise white would have just gotten that so when you see D4 you should take you should not go here Faraz is losing in two moves never play F6 in the opening just don't do it all right in the opening later in the game is fine in the opening it's bad why well because if White had gone here and black had gone here it would have been plus eight because now white has Queen H5 check which ends the game it ends the game because the king can either walk forward and get demolished or you can go here and lose your Rook so F6 like the game is over on move two already which is a record for one of my videos now white here for some reason pushes forward which now allows black to just develop around that and it kind of looks like a London right somebody say oh Bishop is out it's a lot it's not a London a London is a queen's Pawn opening but whatever anyway black plays F5 fascinating move all right I said don't play F6 he plays F6 and F5 trying to break apart the center now make no mistake that is absolutely a free pawn and not only that Queen H5 check G6 now there's Pawn take so I don't know what's happening here white plays Knight F3 all right we gotta counter Gambit on our hands as after F takes E4 white can take the center Pawn now instead of that already the many many many plot twists begin as white plays Bishop to G5 okay now black has a hanging Queen that's called danger levels right the Knight defends the bishop so black should block the attack black goes here now white captures the pawn and Black Blocks the pin okay that sequence of moves Bishop G5 Knight F6 takes and blocking the pin is thus far the only moves that we have seen uh the only sequence of moves that we have seen that makes any sense whatsoever but uh there are 56 more moves to go okay now in this position white of course should continue developing Knight C3 Bishop E2 and castle that's what you should do Bishop C4 whatever I don't care just develop your pieces in Castle what you should not do okay what you should not do is trade a bishop for the Knight for no reason because now black is just better like black is just gonna play Bishop takes F6 pin the Knight hit the pawn there's no reason unless white is very clever and realized that Queen H5 check is on the way and the Knight stops that and Faraz blunder's Checkmate in two Faraz was losing on move two of this game and now he is losing on move seven now on move two he was only losing by numerical value now it's made Queen H5 check there is only one legal move there are absolutely no question marks and then You Follow the yellow brick road and you win white checkmates in nine moves and less than a minute of clock time spent um now which is why he had to block with the bishop so he would at least be able to play G6 but he did this and now white saw that his Knight was hanging and played this white played that move so fast so fast I mean my goodness Knight C4 alright white doesn't seem maintenance too that's how you know it's gonna be a good video now uh for us plays F5 once again completely blundering the move Queen H5 check neither player sees the fact that there is a check that absolutely devastates the safety of the black king uh White will win at minimum two pawns you might not want to lose this you just have to be a little bit careful that is protected um F5 and now white plays the move F3 okay trying to break apart the structure now black plays Bishop F6 yes of course why not play Bishop F6 now when you could have just had the bishop there a couple of moves ago and had not blundered Checkmate in two moves but whatever chess is hard Bishop F6 Bishop E2 now takes takes and black plays D6 finally black is catching up a little bit in development but neither player at all sees this check I mean that is a direct attack on the king the king is gonna have to move which is really bad you do not want to move a king when it's in check you really don't want to do that so Queen D3 uh and it seems quite clear that with the move Queen to D3 uh why does preparing Knight C3 and castles this way now black is better but that's a little bit too complicated so we have to move C5 and immediately white is completely winning again C 5 just doesn't develop any pieces black has sort of completely gotten into his own way and after the move Queen D3 White Castle's short so clearly I have absolutely no idea what black is do uh what white or black are doing uh Queen D3 I thought was preparing long Castle but uh no just this okay black plays Rook G8 and now finally white sees this check and black plays King E7 yes of course because if your options are run to cover on C7 and go to f8 yes of course you bring the king up because you know the king's got to be bold and courageous yes it's all losing every move is losing uh what white should do now is finish developing and play Rook to E1 check slaughtering the king okay instead of white rushes a little bit and this is a very understandable move Queen to E3 but can somebody please explain to me why white has 15 minutes on the clock in a 15 minute game they're playing 1510 so every single time you make a move you gain 10 seconds why do you have the exact starting time in 15 moves I mean really like if you want to play this fast play Blitz I mean white would be a world champion of Blitz the way they're playing this speed you know you guys don't make any sense you're all lying to yourselves you're all doing this you all play 10 minute games 15 minute games and then you play 45 moves in three minutes okay that's ridiculous that's what do you just play a three minute game I'm telling you oh God anyway King D7 and in a shocking turn of events hunting this king with the most powerful piece turns out to not work and white has no Advantage anymore now that might shock you there is a lesson here the lesson is when you attack a king right there is a reason rookie won and rookie 6 is going to be better than playing Queen infiltrating like this might lose some of your advantage but at least it's a rook here why because when you venture into the woods with the Queen the queen needs to deliver the goods or else she'll get trapped she's too valuable you know and if you wander into the deep dark Forest but you can't actually capture anything you're going to lose Queen suddenly cannot capture anything everything is protected and if the queen takes this Pawn which is exactly what happens Black Goes B5 and black just starts counter play alright the queen is just stuck the Queen's not actually attacking anything B5 the Knight moves and now Bishop takes B2 actually just straight up wins White's Rook Black's King in a unbelievable turn of events is actually safe which is how all good 700 ELO games go now you just played the move B5 which removes the defender of the pawn and mind you the bishop has been staring at that pawn for basically half the game it has been unable to capture that pawn because the Knight on B5 has stood there regarding it until now until black successfully kicked out the Knight with the move B5 and follow that up with the very natural Bishop 2a6 which does I have no idea what and now the Knight can continue its journey and attack the queen and be a thorn in the black position so after Knight A5 it was -7 and now after Bishop A6 it is now plus 0.1 terrific wonderful stuff welcome to 700 ELO chess however Queen takes F5 is played instead and now it is -7 once again because there is Bishop takes B2 now here I would love to show you how the 700 ELO mind works black went here because his idea was I'm gonna be so sneaky I'm going to play the move B4 and then my Bishop is going to take this Rook because they won't see it instead of just taking the pawn and trapping The Rook the reason why so many of you struggle is because you try to play chess in a way that's like I'm gonna do something that they will not expect but you realize all the best players in the world expect the same stuff for the most part sometimes they get caught with a sneaky move but that's not how chess actually works at like 1800 level you just both calculate things and miss and you evaluate things differently all right what is with this sneaky nonsense when you could have just won a rook immediately like there was no questions asked why does white have 15 13 on the clock white plays Knight C6 attacking the queen queen f8 and of course black is an absolute genius and ultimately does sneak in here for the capture of The Rook but the game is anything but over oh and by the way why would you not bring the Rook that is the only piece that hasn't moved why are you undeveloping your queen I have no idea okay so black is up material what should black do here absolutely trade the Queens what black would absolutely love is a queen trade because the queen for white can be used as a counter-attacking piece okay it is the most powerful piece on the board for white and black is up material with a slightly weakened King if any of you took my middle games master class link is in the description free sample of the entire fourth chapter uh you would know one of the ways to convert a winning position is to simplify your opponent's most powerful pieces so black goes here trying to trade Knights all right and a few moves later does in fact get rid of that Knight Pawn takes and now you you gotta go here like it you don't even think about it here you play this is what you do you play Queen F1 Rook F1 and Rook f8 you don't even think because let me tell you a rook and a bishop beat a bishop in a night 90 times out of a hundred rook and Bishop beat Bishop at night Rook is too powerful especially when it's got help all right so I mean you just don't even hesitate here now it's 700s right oh so there is a lot of hesitation a lot so now black does this so keep in mind this is Black's 26th move the bishop has seen the B2 Pawn since move nine on move nine was the very first time in this game that the bishop laid eyes on the B2 pawn and only on move 26 did it actually get taken now white is winning why is white winning because in chess the two most important things are material and King safety and if white plays this suddenly the game is all twisted up because if you take my Rook Queen B7 and queen D7 Queen B7 Queen D7 is mate and actually black loses now uh 700s just see The Rook so they play the move Rook A2 now again just trade the queen take the pawn win the game or come back give a check take the queen what does black play no black traps his own Bishop on the side of the board because me see Pawn me take pawn pawn me take two Pawn meetsuk One me take second duh I don't need to play the best move me c Pawn me take Pawn easy peasy terrific stuff alright Queen F7 check now some of you may be asking yourselves uh this is yes yes um the fact that black played this instead is so disgusting like to not sense that the queen is going and let me tell you something right now this queen has had so many chances to perish in this battle that all good games have a plot twist at the end right so let's just stick around and wait now the black king is so weak Bishop back to have oh actually Bishop F3 there is Queen F3 but nobody would have ever seen that uh the attack on the king continues right King C7 and Knight G5 and I mean make no mistake I mean black is winning but it's very tricky because the king is so weak in Bishop F3 and uh the diagonal is open and I mean you just completely trapped your Bishop on the edge of the board for no reason uh and now black plays this and hangs The Rook just hanging The Rook in one move which is promptly captured and now white is back to being winning however there are still some questions about this King this king is kind of left alone you know and one move I really like here by black is Queen E5 now the engine hates it the engine hates this move because black is actually just losing like if you just give checks here you can win by accident for example King C6 uh Bishop F3 uh King B6 Queen B8 and it's Checkmate so literally if you just give checks in this position to the black king you can probably win by mistake just by accident just giving checks and all of a sudden you win the game uh instead of that white sees this and this is why you always have to look for checks capture's attacks they don't look for checks they play a defensive move and okay this is not made anymore because Rook F1 right so that's good Bishop B8 and now it's mate it's made for black checkmate you see this bishop can come back and pin The Rook but if you change your move order if you always look for checks check only move mate boom massive comeback but nobody's looking for checks instead they see that the Rook is hanging so they play Rook to G7 uh and now a very nice idea here sack the queen check pick up but that's maybe a little bit too complicated instead white does this and takes and now blunder's Checkmate again now at this point it is nothing short of insane that black did not play Queenie one check like for us I am upset with you Faraz could have just given a check and as I keep saying could have won this game by accident just discovering the checks as they happen instead Faraz pinned The Rook to the king but now he's winning Queen E1 is now mate in for us please for us you have had three opportunities to mate you have no more pieces you only have for us for the love of God please for us Queenie this wasn't even a difficult move this wasn't even a day it was just straight down the oh my God he's trying to make a queen and now King F1 and now he takes and now it's over black is just black is lost check B3 but suddenly suddenly black is a square away from making a queen now yes it says Maiden four and of course to get made in four you need to give checks and you need to give checks but this is not easy this is not easy and many people would not realize that they definitely have a mate here now you you absolutely have a mate okay I mean Knight C8 King B7 ah Queen C6 uh [Music] Queen maybe I already messed it up by the way let's go back where is the mate the mate is tricky it's this you have to bring the bishop back yeah that's hard that is hard so I kind of get it why in this position you play Bishop G6 but make no mistake you are still very winning it's now made again check King B7 and now white plays one of the most egregious blunders I have ever seen in my life I'm not joking I have seen thousands of chess games of newbies I used to be a school teacher I taught five and six and seven-year-olds white has 10 minutes on the clock here and plays the move Queen to B8 foreign and white played that move in six seconds because white gets 10 second bonus so 1010 was on the clock when this move happened which is 6 seconds Queen B8 loses the queen in one move black doesn't black played that move in four seconds now we have this and that's it you are not going to make another queen take the queen oh my God why is nobody simplifying what he plundered the bishop would check Queen takes oh my God now white sees that I mean black sees that and all of a sudden all of a sudden black is queening what what there's no way how is this possible now the craziest thing about this position is black straight up makes two queens it's over now black is just gonna check white until May age seven right mate but you are stopping it and now just to make super super super sure black puts both Queens on the same diagonal you ain't mating yeah yeah ain't promoting it's just not happening you're just never making the queen and now it's very simple you just give checks Queen C3 is one of the moves you can also get as close as possible I would recommend that when you try to mate with two queens because two queens together are unstoppable so Queen F1 would be the best but okay check and now the game is over uh there are about 45 000 different ways to win this game um no actually you know there are probably about 50 000 different ways to win this game with black okay you can give a check you can give a check you can give a check you can give a check I mean I really everything is you can go all the way no be a little careful I was gonna see it all the way back but I don't know maybe you don't want to separate the queens that much so in this position black finds the following way to end this game black plays Queen to G7 intending a queen trade which would prevent the pawn from going but the pawn goes and now the only move here is to take the queen and white wins the game by checkmate
