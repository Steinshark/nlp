ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the Chess World Cup 2023 it is Championship day the first day of this tournament was July 30th today is August 23rd and today we might Crown a World Cup champion either Magnus Carlson or pragnananda and this is a sensation Prague is the youngest ever finalist by four years he is also the third youngest player to ever qualify to the candidates tournament he has knocked out the number three and number two ranked players now he is playing against Magnus Carlson who is playing in his first World Cup final it is Messi versus zimbape it's the young guy the Superstar versus The Old Guard who just hasn't had an opportunity to win this tournament and it's also Fabiano caruana versus ninjag for the bronze medal Fabi Trails won nothing on the ropes about to get knocked out you know the drill this recap is going to be two games today we have no sponsors I'm a brand risk apparently you know what today is sponsored by my book my book we Are 2 000 pre-orders away from being a New York Times bestseller so if you haven't had an opportunity yet check out the links in the description you can get it in Spanish you can get it in the UK at 25 off and you can still get it at any of your favorite American bookstores Fabiano white pieces I'm going to show you the appetizer game first and then it's time it's time for us to Crown the champion on to E4 on to C5 the Sicilian Defense nijot plays this against Fabi he also played it against Magnus uh nijad has to not lose so he could play this right he could go for e45 but I think he trusts Fabiano a little bit too much Bobby's gonna come up with something and push a little bit so instead nijot sticks to his guns most people were in there they're in a situation with the black pieces they have to not lose they're not going to play a sicilian because you play a sicilian to lose and to win you don't really play it to draw Knight F3 and now E6 the thing about the Sicilian is that black has to show their cards very early like am I playing an accelerated Dragon am I playing a special cough now you may remember nijot abbasov played Knight C6 against Magnus of course you don't remember that because many of you just watch him be entertained and then go to Clash of Clans or you know whatever you do during the day I don't judge um that's what he did against uh Magnus and then Magnus went here am I triggering anything memory rosalimo he played magnus's opening against him but nietobasa is one of the you know he's one of the strongest 100 players in the world so he's flexible he plays D4 excuse me he plays E6 Fabiano plays D4 uh and now we are in a what's called a Timon of Sicilian in fact Fabiano this was like his exclusive opening I mean Fabiano used to play the time out of as well so nijan played magnus's opening against Magnus and he plays fabi's opening against Fabi which is gangster stuff and then here rather than playing Queen C7 which is the Timon of he plays the modern uh version of this which is the Four Knights which is the four Knight Sicilian and this is a very very sharp opening uh nowadays there are lines where where white does something completely ridiculous and like moves the king to E2 so there are lines like Queen C7 F4 uh and then you know the the bishop develops and you play C4 and bring your king out like it's it's really really goofy stuff uh but instead of that Fabi plays a move Bishop F4 I actually played this move uh some of you that have followed my chess career for a long time uh I I didn't play Bishop F4 here I actually played it in this position uh and it was a move played at the candidates tournament last year the tournament that determines who plays for the world championship Fabio plays Bishop F4 in this position this is not a fork because while it looks like a fork the pawn is supported by the Knight so you just take the knight uh and then it's not a fork and then you just win a pawn so it's really really not a fork so Bishop to B4 is played by nijot he pins the Knight to the king Fabi plays Knight to B5 simultaneously defending himself and threatening an infiltration this is not a free Pawn uh well I mean it kind of is the thing is if you play Knight C7 right away and then you take the Rook uh black does not go here black goes here and has a lot of threats so it's not like this is just excuse me it's not like this is just all a free pawn and you know like how did Fabi blunder that no this is kind of like black is now going to waste time black is winning upon but he has an opportunity to get his hand caught in the mountain in the cookie jar or the tail caught in The Mousetrap or the you know whatever uh D5 is played and now Knight C7 check and now a move that's really going to confuse you which is not taking the Rook but rather long Castle now you will notice Fabian played that move instantly literally it took him five seconds to play that move because he got 30 extra seconds so yeah 12 seconds on the clock he spends five seconds on this move which is the amount of time it took him to write down his opponent's move and then move and then make his own once again the reason he's not taking is because he clearly knows something about the position probably E5 Knight D4 or queen I5 something like this and white has won a rook but at the cost of giving black monster development and really this Knight is trapped so it's not really a full Rook it's weird I know to the untrained eye this looks really stupid long castles nichot takes on C3 and Fabiano enjoys a 20 minute time Advantage as well as a very powerful initiative now the computer here gives E5 and then the best move for white is to sack the bishop because you're going to win the night back instead of that new job thinks and plays Queen E7 uh which is a very solid move and he's trying to play Queen A3 check Fabio plays C4 you will notice that Fabiano has still not spent any time C4 simultaneously try to tries to pry open the center while also defending with the queen I want you all to think about something you know I make these Recaps and they're great and you enjoy them because I'm you know funny and handsome and I'm a good role model and I'm family friendly thank you by the way for thinking all of those things about me I'm you know I'm also very funny I'm also very humble um but one thing I want you to all learn from these Recaps uh is like little nuggets of information every time a piece moves in chess you have to think about how it affects the whole board for example this move affects so much more than you would think it directly affects the pawn which affects the Knight but the queen opened to see there the the B four and D4 squares are now weakened the bishop is now blocked right like little things like this I mean it affects the whole board so Queen F6 trying to get in Bobby blocks out the queen Fabi still hasn't spent any time apparently Queen F6 was inaccurate nijot had to play G5 or night before nijok plays G5 now Fabi plays Bishop D6 check finally fabi's on his own he's on his own he plays Bishop D6 check because if you take you no longer defend the queen here Queen trade and finally he gets the rook in the middle of all that Skirmish that Rook has been hanging Knight takes D6 but now the way that Fabi won The Rook the Knight has a way out right the Knight is gonna get out first he takes in the center and now he he waits he doesn't develop with the Knight yet because he doesn't want his opponent to play Knight to E4 so he plays Pawn to F3 and nijok plays Knight to F5 and Fabiano starts escaping with the Knight and look my friends uh black has an extra Pawn black has six pawns uh but he has a uh a knight for a rook so he's down what we call an exchange D4 he's trying to trade off his weakness what do you do when you're up material you try to simplify right try to simplify Knight to E3 move the Rook up and defend the pawn rookie one Rook C8 and now a very nice idea Rook takes Knight point is if you take this Rook D7 you know seven times out of ten eight times out of ten getting two pieces for a rook is a really good deal uh and then after that if you get something like this it's just a completely winning end game a rook and a knight will just beat a rook with many pawns on the board Rook C7 has played instead rookie 4 and now Fabiano a couple of moves later act you know puts pressure with his with his Rooks and this is the end game that he now has to win uh actually this is the end game that he now has to win essentially nijot gave up all his pawns and said we have three versus three on the same side rook and Bishop versus two Rooks here's what ninjata is going to do he's gonna put his Bishop right here gonna put his Pawn right here he's gonna go like this and he's gonna say Fabi come get me Bobby come get me I'm drunk at the club like I you know I I'm just not gonna move so Fabiano offers a rook trade now black does not really want to trade Rooks without his Rook the winning chances for white go up drastically how does white win this game he advances with his pawns he's gonna trade one of the pawns not two and then he's going to find a way to advance the suffocate black push him backwards and either get to the king or get to the pawns right so he's gonna walk him down can Fabi make a comeback on demand winning against Niger base after losing game number one he's improving his position a lot but where is the win I told you nijad's defensive setup there it is I mean how do you break this down how are we going to do this Rook B5 Rook C4 Rook B6 how we gonna do this I mean you can't sacrifice Black's position is a brick wall he's not moving at all at some point five is gonna have to use his pawns there it is Big Moment here if black takes on H4 his pawns get split which allows White's pawns to team up which could be really really really good however if black plays F6 now we get to the King which is really bad now the king is on the back rank mating possibilities that's not made but it's very close uh and black is going to likely lose this game very very soon so G takes H4 Fabi takes with the Rook and now black plays H5 and it looks like black again Black's position Rock Solid how is Fabi gonna break through he starts bringing his Pawn and Nija plays King F6 Rook G5 Rook C6 apparently nijot had to play Rook C1 because White's idea in the game was to bring his King and the idea let's say black plays something like Rook A6 is to play F5 so King H4 now we use our F Pawn we swarm and Rook takes H5 and the game is over in this position the only chance that nijad had uh was to like move his Rook and you ask what's that gonna do well he he's just gonna lose the bishop and he's gonna have to play the same game but it's all losing the point is that after taking he now can't move at all nothing can move Pawn to G4 is on the way you could play King G6 which play Rook G5 check Fabiano caruana wins on demand and uh one to one they will now have to play a tie break which leaves us with a championship game the winner of this game wins the World Cup Magnus Carlson with the white pieces with the black pieces they drew their first game prop put a little bit of pressure on Magnus but nothing substantial here we go Magnus opens with E4 remember I told you if you played a not lose you don't play the Sicilian Prague does not play the Sicilian he plays E5 he goes Magnus we're gonna be symmetrical what are we gonna do Knight to F3 Knight to C6 now we have Italians we have spanishers Magnus does love his Spanish but he also could go for an Italian he's not going to play a ponziani too many equalizing lines at top level could go for a scotch plays Knight C3 that's an interesting one Knight C3 the Four Knights I mean you know in a lot of different spanishes uh let's just you know get to get to just an arbitrary position white play C3 and D3 and Maneuvers same in the attack Knight C3 is a big commitment but okay so Four Knights and now Bishop to B5 this is one of the moves putting pressure now normally black plays Bishop to B4 here just symmetrical uh black can also Play Bishop D6 defending this uh black can also Play Bishop C5 which has gotten popular recently and also Knight D4 basically saying look this is not actually a free pun because I play Queen E7 and I just laser beam you and if you defend yourself I'm gonna take the bishop and then I'm gonna play D6 this has been played before at top level but it's not really a significant try for an advantage uh there's one extremely stupid looking line here that goes like this and then white is threatening rookie one I mean it's like really stupid you have to be really really ridiculous to play like this but the other line of Knight D4 is that after take take there's nothing for white to do here except play E5 so Magnus opts for an opening with no horses but again he's the goat so like whatever he does we follow Queen takes F6 D takes C3 an interesting position obviously it's completely equal uh White you know has the opening the slightly damaged Pawn structure but he has the two open files he's gonna Castle play like an active queen move probably an active bishop move put his Rooks on the center lines uh and his Rooks are going to you know do a great job and better job than you know I can drawing my arrows so Magnus is is looking for an end game fight that's what he's looking for uh and uh Prague is looking for mate in one Queen takes F2 that's just made just you know now another interesting decision here uh castling clearly the best move right and then castling for black is the best move those of you with a Keen Eye will go that's free kind of because if you pin I actually have Queen H5 and that's counter-attacked which is kind of hilarious hilarious but uh black will play Bishop here or Bishop here and bring his Rooks and despite being down upon uh this is White's extra Pawn so the computer doesn't actually give it a huge advantage uh but Magnus doesn't Castle he does not Castle instead going Queenie to check and proc plays Queen E6 so you can take you can't take like that but you can take like that now this this bishop F4 move here in this position white has castled white has taken to create some sort of imbalance why does also I think like uh there's other moves that way let's try it excuse me um I'm allergic to Queen trades but Magnus plays Bishop F4 which has been played a decent amount of times and um it's been played by David Howell so Magnus drawing on the inspiration of a friend and if you don't know that he and David Howell friends I mean they're um my God what is I gotta I'm not this is I gotta I gotta drink a little Seltzer here not not sponsored oh my goodness all right Bishop F4 Magnum is drawing on the inspiration of his friend and he's looking for an endgame fight against Prague doesn't matter about the Queens King can come up in the end game rookie one Rook D1 again we're centralizing that's what we're going for Prague kicks out the bishop takes more Central space opens up his light squared Bishop before castling uh and that is important because heady Castle you know Magnus would bring his King out and then he would have a Target and then he would get to the file faster so we have D5 Magnus fights back with the c Pawn but you may notice something you may notice that the position is literally the same uh they both have their Bishops on the exact same squares they now have the exact same Pawn structure a moment ago you know I was talking about the e-file the D file and what else you might notice is you know progress spent a decent amount of time Magnus has not really spent much time at all except right here when he gambits the C Pawn Bishop C2 and I think the idea is to immediately laser beam and then take on F7 and take on C5 and instead of even getting involved in that prog just says I'm gonna Castle because you have a king in the center of the board Magnus moves the bishop back and then moves the king to F1 out of the danger because he had gone to F3 there was Bishop D5 which was a bit unpleasant she goes here plays B3 slides this Rook over to enable that Rook to come to the center and uh a couple of moves later rookie one Bishop D5 and the Rooks fall off the board and you may be asking yourself where is the plot twist well C4 the bishops get traded if it's a dark squared Bishop end game the pawns belong on the light squares so Magnus plays H3 brings his King up the black king can enter on F5 but after something like Bishop to E3 you know you can trade you have to be a little bit careful here accidentally blundering into a difficult end game but I mean Magnus can also just not do that he can move his Bishop to D2 and play G4 G6 and the game is over in this position Magnus carlsen's cell phone rang and he got forfeited no that's not what happened um they drew and you might feel a certain way you might feel what the hell what was that the championship game with the white pieces this is what he did uh Magnus is uh ill for the past four or five days he's actually been battling food poisoning remember the last time you had food poisoning I have food poisoning some months ago and after I projectile vomited at three in the morning into my toilet I collapsed on the bathroom floor and I remember laying there feeling the cold floor on my face and going will I die tonight like is this it um and you know the worst is when it comes out of both sides you know what I'm saying it's not to get into details here but point is you know he's recovering from food poisoning um I think we can give him a little bit of a pass who knew that this chest recap would turn into me describing you know what substances are departing magnus's orifices um he's gonna rest up and we have two very different tie breaks tomorrow this matchup is for the gold this is either magnus's first ever World Cup win and probably basically retirement from classical chess in these events uh or Prague is going to beat Magnus and tie breaks and take down the one two and three best players in the world which would be absolutely Bonkers I don't know who I'm cheering for let me know if you're cheering for proger Magnus in the comments uh and if um and that's it that's all that's all I've you know got for you today I wish I had a longer one but um I saw your comments about my me wearing it tanked up and that I have no gym gains um that wasn't very nice but I'll forgive you if you pre-ordered the book so tomorrow August 24th we will Crown a winner between Magnus and Prague and we will Crown a winner between Fabiano caruana and yujada basa first second third and fourth place will be determined I got nothing else to say get out of here
