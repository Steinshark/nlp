for all of you that have been following the symbolic World supporting symbolic world you know that we have been through quite a bit of Madness regarding the website you know I wanted to revamp the website revamp the uh The Branding for the symbolic world you know I wanted to bring a forum a community and uh you know emphasize the Articles there's a lot of stuff I wanted to do we did that but then everything started going crazy we never got the form we wanted then when we migrated everything vanished all the content started just disappeared the article didn't work and so all of this craziness led us to find a another person another group to work with and we started working with a wonderful group called residents that have just been amazing and bringing together this new website which I'm very excited to show you now so this is the new website and so on the on the new website as you see it looks very similar to the the one that we had before you know you have the different sections at the outset on the front page there will be some differences of course as you can see even down here we're already hinting at the new course on Beowulf that uh Richard Roland will be putting together with me that we will be making available on the website we want to do a lot more of that going doing deep dive symbolism with different people with myself or different partners uh so so to really kind of Dive In and so when you get to the front page you'll notice that the content we have articles podcasts which are basically the videos or the podcasts but we also added the reading list which people we had taken out of the last version of the website and people really wanted to bring back and so in the reading list you we have an augmented version with uh added books you know separated into categories we also added a friends of the symbolic World different people that I've worked with that I've collaborated with that are Akin or you know running parallel ideas to what we're doing you'll recognize all of these names here and of course some resources like the Orthodox art Journal that I wrote hundreds of articles for a long time ago but that are still there and I'm still somewhat involved with that um and then you know like the Exodus series with Jordan Peterson which is quite popular uh list of universal history with Richard Roland so all of that is there in terms of the content you'll notice that what we've done is we've added the content directly into all the content directly into the podcast section which means that even the the patron only videos will be appearing here and they'll have a little premium sign here and so once you're signed in if you're supporting the symbolic world then it'll be easier to find premium content you'll just go into the content you can just click on it and if you're logged in you have access to it because I know it was complicated to go through emails and go through all the stuff to find the premium content now it will be completely available we will be organizing all this by tags so if you want to know did I ever talk about this you know did Jonathan talk about this it'll be easier to find and with the search engine as well so in terms of the articles with the latest website so many of the Articles vanished everything with chaos and so thank you to Cormac Jones and to JP maxo for working hard with all the people who had written the Articles to start putting them back onto the website and so I think they're all there and if there's a few missing they will be coming back up very soon as some of you might know JP has been working managing the blog for years now doing an amazing job uh he's married now you know a lot of things are going on in his life and so uh so Cormac Jones is taking over and JP will still be around writing articles and doing the French podcast with me and so that's a great thing that's going on now the big thing that's been added to the website is of course the community when you click on community if you are logged in you will come to the the circle app that is integrated into the website circle is a wonderful app and it's kind of like Facebook but uh it'll be our own Community people can come in create profiles you can message privately uh you can write comments on the Articles within Circle we can create groups meeting groups all this stuff is going to be available and this is where I'm going to focus my energy uh you know if we're going to try to create surprise events where people can just sign up and show up to the event so if you're if you're signed up to the symbolic world at any level then you will have access to this all right let's go back all right let me just log out so that you can see what it looks like when you come on the first time so when you come on and you're logged out if you go to community it will ask you to sign up to become a member at different levels same thing if you go to subscribe and so the membership is now there are different levels we have everybody that wants to receive the newsletter to be part of the community Forum uh just has to kind of sign up to the website and so there is a free subscriber which has access to community post post to the community discussions if I do surprise events on the community people can can show up for that uh you also get the newsletter and then we have the different tiers of support the five dollar tier has access to the monthly Patron only video also the Q a which has been made Patron only to be able to manage it properly and you can show up live you can ask your questions uh and I interact with the chat a lot more now that it's private and I answer questions in the chat so for people who support it ten dollars or more people can then submit q a questions in advance and we of course filter them because there's too many but I do end up answering about 50 questions per per uh q a we tried to to find the questions that haven't been asked too many times in the past and that are the most relevant and then I can answer your questions on the Q a now for the 25 a month what I'm going to be doing is having once once a year a meeting with about four people will open slots you can sign up to the different slots it'll give you a chance to ask me questions in person have a discussion all right so we'll have a one hour meeting uh with three other people uh with you to uh to discuss whatever it is you want to discuss uh you can sign up for fifty dollars a month to get two meetings a year and then in the top here is what we have is a a for 150 a month doctor of symbolism you have twice a year a one-on-one a zoom call with me for 30 minutes for at the 300 level then it's once a month where you get a 30 minute phone call people use that to kind of to deal with some of the let's say some of the deeper issues they have with symbolism or sometimes if they want to talk about a project they're doing you know I have people that have signed up for this to uh work on screenplays to work on their novel their ideas and so during the conversation you kind of tell me your idea and uh and then we can we can discuss about it or you know whatever it is you want to talk about that's part of that discussion and the in the two top tiers we also get a monthly 60-minute seminar where really then you know you get me unplugged we talk a lot more about what's going on in the news what's going on in the media you know uh let's say we don't record those discussions and so I'm more unfiltered and uh just it's a more direct conversation about about uh what's going on in the world let's say and so once you you want to you can sign up and you can pick the different tier years if you're already subscribed which I am you will go to this part
