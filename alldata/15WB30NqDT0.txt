one of the most common comments I get in all my videos is what are those type hints or why do I have a string next to this text over here why do I do that and then I also get quite a lot of comments with the people who do use this having a really big misconception on what it actually does so in this video I want to go over one of the biggest misconceptions that people have with typings and in case you don't know what typings are this video will show you very briefly how they actually work so one of the first things I want to mention is that you can either call this a type hint or a type annotation and it's going to mean the same thing in terms of python just in case you hear both of those terms being used around in the community now for every single object in Python you have the option to give it a type annotation and that just tells the code editor that you want to make sure that this is a string so for example if we type in string here it's going to work perfectly fine but if we type in something so such as 100 we're going to get this yellow syntax highlighting warning us that we meant to put a string there so this can be considered a great win in terms of readability when you are programming in Python it really makes it explicit what kind of variable you have and what type it should actually be and this also works with classes so if you have a class called fruit for example and it has an initializer you busted who wants an INT as an initializer so you have an initializer and all it does is print hello you can now use this fruit as a type annotation so for example if you create a new object and you call it let's say banana you can say that this is of type fruit and then you can create that fruit and that just makes it explicit that we have a fruit here now one of the greatest places to use it is in the parameter section when you're creating a function so if you type in let's say some random function and it has a parameter and you want this to be a list of type string for example the benefits of giving it that type hint is that now when we type in parameter we get all of these context options which really helps us out as a developer when we're working in some sort of IDE you'll notice that without the type hint you're going to have to do your best job to type it in manually because most code editors are not going to help you with that if they do not know what the type is so the parameter is going to take this list of type string and it's just going to reverse that list and then we're going to return the parameter so it's just going to reverse whatever list we give it and you can also Define a return type so here you can type in list of type string if you want to be explicit that this should return a string so if we do some Monkey Business inside here and accidentally return an integer we're going to get this yellow syntax highlighting warning us that we're not returning the type that we wanted to return so that was the basic concept behind using type hints in Python now the biggest misconceptions we have about type hints is that it speeds up our program and this is absolutely false it does not speed up our program in any notable way especially since the python interpreter ignores these and that means that no type checking is occurring at runtime here if you decide to add an integer and you say text again of type Boolean and you type in text or we can just change this to Boolean for example there's nothing stopping you from doing this and if you print both of these you print text and you print the Boolean the program is still going to run it's not going to care that you put the wrong data types it's just a mental note in other words that gives you extra context options in certain scenarios but it does not speed up your program in any notable way so it's not a premature optimization that you should be focused on I like to use it as much as possible because it really reminds me what I'm trying to do in my code and if I create a fruit and I create a function that uses that fruit I want to know what I'm getting back from the function as obvious as some code might sound for me adding type hints just feels right I mean there are some scenarios you might want to ignore it especially if the data type isn't really that easy to associate with the variable there are some scenarios where I skip on it but for the majority of cases I will always use typings because I personally love it it doesn't speed up your code in any significant way but it can enhance the readability of your code and prevent you from making some very silly mistakes early on in your program if you're using an IDE that can spot this in a normal text editor you will not get any syntax highlighting so that's absolutely up to you whether you use type hinting or not well that being said I'm very curious to hear your opinion on type hints do leave it in the comment section down below it's very easy for me to miss important points when I'm recording these so I really love to read your comments and I highly appreciate anything that's informative and backed by documentation but anyways with all that being said I hope you enjoyed this video and as always thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video
