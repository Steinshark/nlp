[Music] [Applause] a Super Metroid one of Nintendo's most popular games since it came out back in 1994 it puts the player through an absolute Adventure you get dropped onto the planet zebus and make your way underground exploring a vast world of enemies powerups and other Oddities along the way you fight several bosses which test both the player's skill and guts to push onward finally at the end of it all is motherb brain an extremely difficult fight that lasts for several minutes and then a final Escape back onto the ship many Gamers agree that this game is one of Nintendo's masterpieces its popularity has stood the test of time and it's still commonly played today as a way of honoring its greatness for more than a decade a group of speedr Runners have been battling each other to beat it as fast as they can it's been raced at Games Done Quick events and thousands of hours have been poured into the streaming the game live on Twitch to either get a lower personal best or even lower the world record in fact speedrun.com says that there's only three games in history that have been run more than Super Metroid given the game Legacy the world record for this game has gone through many changes whether it be new strategies or better execution So today we're going to look at how the record for Super Metroid has gotten lower over time one quick thing to note about this game there are two ways of timing it the in-game timer that you were presented with at the end of the game and real time which is a more traditional approach of timing the run from start to finish with a timer speedr Runners are originally used in-game time since it was accurate and didn't require the hassle of setting a timer this would eventually change but I'll explain that later we're going to start by going all the way back to 2004 Super Metroid speedrunner Smokey was able to get the first Super Metroid run with footage that still exists today with an iname time of 38 minutes or 56 minutes and 22 seconds of real time here's how we did it there are four major boss fights in this game before fighting Mother Brain CRA fanton Ridley and Dron you can defeat these bosses in whichever word you want as long as you defeat them all at some point Smokey started off his run by heading into brinstar and fighting CRA he was able to do a quick kill on CRA by shooting him with a super missile when cra's mouth was like this walking it into position and finishing off the fight quickly normally cr's fight could last over a minute as you'd have to rise all the way up like this from the ground with this quick kill it was over in only about 10 seconds next Smokey headed over to the wrecked ship and fought phanton you can only hit phantoon in his eye and you can only hit his eye when it is exposed fanton also likes to move around a lot depending on what patterns he gives this fight can either take a very long time or be over fairly quickly this fight ended up taking Smokey around 90 seconds then Smokey went into Meridia to fight Dron Dron is one of the most difficult sections of the game she can either swoop down or do a mucus cycle the mucus cycle is where she releases mucus and pretty much just waste time and the swoop is where she well swoops down while Smokey didn't have a perfectly clean fight it was certainly good enough given the time finally the last boss that smokey fought was Ridley in lower norfair Ridley can do a lot he can go invisible grab Samus charge at her bu go up and down and of course swoop across the screen with a bit of luck and a lot of skillful execution Smokey is able to defeat Ridley in about 60 seconds the pattern of going through the bosses in the order smokey did C then phantoon then Dron and then Ridley will be used as a template for how to go through the game as fast as possible for years it became known as the KPD route taking the first letter from the name of each of the four bosses in the order that they were fought after going through these four bosses Smokey headed back up to the ship to get his energy back and then headed over the fight Mother Brain this fight has three forms the first form is easy enough you just break open the glass tank with missiles then the second form appears and the player first sees how big motherb brain truly is the best way to deal with this section is to just keep dealing charge shots directly mother brain's face and Dodge her attacks some of which can kill even one hit smokey did a beautiful job of this in his run after this phas is a cut scene and then the third and final form of Mother Brain where he must deal as much damage to her as quickly as you can Smokey's method of doing this was to just stand in the lower right corner of the screen and constantly land face shots it worked well enough and then all Smokey had to do was escape the exploding planet and get onto the ship since he was trying to optimize game time instead of real time he called his run 38-minute run Smokey would eventually lower his time down to 36 minutes but no footage of his later runs exists today a couple of years later in 2006 a runner named garubo was able to beat Smokey's 36-minute run with a 34-minute run and was playing to shock the speedrunning community with it but right as he was about to submit it to the website speed demos archive where most speedrunners showed off their runs he got a major surprise a Japanese Runner had already beaten him by 2 minutes and I gotten a 32 this runner's name Hodo Ruby for anybody who hasn't heard of Hodo Ruby he was one of the most legendary speedrunners of all time he saw the world record in Mario games Mega Man games several other games and franchises and many of his records were unbeatable for years there's not really much that I can say that would be enough to pay tribute to how amazing he really was the way he got the 32 was mainly just by executing everything like a god when the Run came out nearly everybody thought that it was fake the time was just too low for it to be real here's an actual quote from the speed demo archive verification team when the Run was submitted hot Ruby's level of play is so far beyond anything yet seen on the site that his run was stuck in verification for weeks while the verifiers tried to decide whether or not the video was legitimate however no evidence of Foul Play was ever found and so today on behalf of Metroid 2002p speed demo archive I am proud to present Super Metroid in 32 single segment people use things like the fact that hod Ruby did arm pumping on a downward slope before Speed Booster to try and prove that the Run was fake normally arm pumping like that down a slope would interrupt samus's running speed but if these people had actually tested it for themselves they would have realized that this only applies on certain slopes the one before the speed booster was fine to arm pump on probably the best part of this run was at the end hod Ruby knew that he had a 32 on loock but also knew that he wasn't going to be fast enough to get a 31 so just for the hell of it he decided to save the animal for anybody unfamiliar with what this is during the final escape sequence you can take this path into another room and shoot this door behind a room filled with animals to save them all this changes is at the end you see a tiny pixel float off into the distance which is supposed to be the animals that escaped all in all this Waits about 25 seconds and it's supposed to just be a meme done at Games Done Quick events sometimes but no hod Ruby decided that he would create a run so amazing everyone thought that it was fake and and save the animals just to annoy everyone a little more after this run came out a couple of Super Metroid Runners Azor and 072 decided they wanted to try and beat hot's run by getting a 31-minute segmented run as opposed to hot's single segment run which is a traditional run completed from start to finish without stopping the segmented run is a run completed in multiple segments Runners can grind one segment over and over until they get it how they like and then move on to the next one once they get a great run for each segment they can piece them together and becomes known as a segmented run people figured that this would probably be the only way to beat hod Ruby 32 but then hot Ruby just decided to get a 31 single segment run and once again people were completely in awe of his skill one interesting thing that hod Ruby did during this run was decide to focus more on Real Time strategies rather than game time strategies one such Strat was the murder beam this normally creates a vertical beam during mother r three that continuously deals damage but it is much slower for real time about a minute slower so he decided to not do it for this run amazingly even though he decided to use real-time strategies hod Ruby was still able to beat his old run in game time since he was going for real time this run gradually stopped being referred to as a 31 and began to be called its real time equivalent a 4925 for a few years H Ruby was completely Untouchable people began to race Super Metro instead of going for the world record attempts because they knew that nobody could possibly beat Hodo Ruby as a result of those real-time races the category universally began to be ran in real time and the game time was pretty much completely thrown out eventually in early 2012 Runners finally were able to get sort of close to hot Ruby's run seven people Garrison MSDS casassus dbx fiana emodin and hypo were all trying to get their own sub 50-minute run eventually two of these Runners Rose Above the Rest and got a sub 50 fiana and emod Doran I was unable to find footage of these runs but regardless these two Runners were close to doing the unthinkable taking down hod Ruby's nearly perfect world record unfortunately though neither of them were able to pull it off they got close but hot Ruby's run was just too good it seemed like hot Ruby's record would stand for years more but after fiana and emod Doran faded away from the Super Metro Community another one of those seven Runners was able to pull off a sub 50 Garrison Garrison streamed his attempts live on Twitch he was able to share his excitement with his viewers live as he slowly closed in on hot Ruby's record after a steady series of improvements Garrison was just a few seconds away from hot Ruby finally on June 6th 2012 it seemed like he was going to beat it it was going to be close and it was all coming down to the final Escape are you are you kidding me dude tww his timer showed that he had beaten it by 1 second but in reality Garrison tried to go down into the ship too early and stop the timer then too he actually went down about a second later so he was officially tied with hod Ruby but a week later he had another chance [Music] what [Music] bad Escape after having the record for 6 years hoto Ruby had finally been topped it wasn't by much and it was slower in the in-game timer but Garrison had done what so many thought was impossible taking the record from hod Ruby over the next few months Garrison continued to run Super Metroid the combination of better movement better RNG and slightly improved strategies allowed him to keep pushing his record time down lower one such strategy was the full halfy which allows the runner to skip the entire Coliseum for months Garrison and MSDS spent countless hours trying to figure out these new strategies leading to Garrison calling MSDS the unsung hero of Super Metroid eventually Garrison was able to push his time down all the way to 4750 but while Garrison was doing this another Super Metroid player was quickly improving in the background caught power originally a pal Runner or a runner of the European version of the game cop power became a aware of the grind for the ntsc record after it was showcased at Esa 2012 he set out to improve his time in mid 2012 his PB was 54 minutes just a few months later he improved so much that he was able to take the record from Garrison out of nowhere on November 3rd [Music] 2012 for a few months after that Garrison and cop power took turns lowering the record mostly they just kept out executing the other but C power also found a semi-consistent way to do an extremely difficult trick the big Metroid skip which allows you to skip getting grabbed by this Metroid at the end of the game and save a few seconds while Garrison and C power continued to trade the record back and forth a new Runner zost proved his skill and took it from [Music] them hell yeah Dam my heart is beating so hard it was pretty clear to most that zost was a pretty big force to be reckoned with and we'll get to zost again later but anyway these three kept trading the record back and forth and once the time came down to 4536 by C power it seemed as though the Run was getting pretty close to the boundaries of what was humanly possible new strategies were coming out all the time but nobody could have expected what was coming next on July 26th 2013 Super Metroid fans woke up to find that the record had changed once again only this time it wasn't zost Garrison or cop power it was by a speedrunner who didn't even stream on Twitch Behemoth this run was done thanks to a number of new strategies that he had figured out with the help of other runners in secret in a private thread some of these strategies included climbing up the red Tower super quickly similar to how the tool assisted run did it and defeating the plaz priates with a super bomb this method of grinding strategies and getting the record offline became known as Behemoth thing so one could see that zos got Behemoth with this run zos got back to grinding and using these strategies he's able to get the record back from Behemoth a couple of weeks later the chat was pretty excited including this Runner named oats and goats remember that name at this point the new strategies aot for the time to come all the way down to a 44 s was the first one to get it although Runners Ivan and kower also were trying to get the record these three runners and Garrison ended up Racing the game at agdq 2014 and what has gone down is one of the greatest speedrunning races of all time well and I after that agdq it was all Z he wanted to push the game as far as he could the in-game timer was at a 29 sto for all of his runs and he wondered if maybe he could get it down to a 28 he pushed it more and more and to his surprise in August of 2014 he got the 28 oh  holy dude the time of that run in real time was a 440 wait it seemed like that might be a fitting ending to the game speedrun the game had started by being timed by in-game time and while it had switched to real time Z had pushed the game time down as far as it seemed it could go in the process but then Z got Behemoth again for the past 10 years or maybe even longer Runners have been following the same route that smokey did at the beginning of the video CRA first then fanton then Dron and finally Ridley in early 2014 Behemoth began to search maybe there was a faster route through the game he looked with reev forensic and even Smokey who was one of the first Runners to use the KPD route and after a few months of searching and a few more months of practicing a working out quirks Behemoth had himself a new route to use fun first then Ridley then CRA and finally draon this route ended up having a huge potential to save time if executed correctly and given great RNG it could save up to 100 seconds of real time although it would lose 2 minutes of game time but nobody really cared about game time while the minute and 40 seconds of gain seemed fantastic the only problem is that it's harder a lot harder and the luck required with the boss's patterns to get all 100 seconds is pretty unlikely still that didn't stop Behemoth from Behemoth exhaust once again and taking his record but 20 seconds with this new route just 5 days after zos got the 448 the reaction to this new route being discovered was overwhelming positive from almost the entire Super Metroid Community the potential to lower the record was great so Z and Behemoth got to work slowly executing the route better and better and getting better RNG in there hell yeah not bad not bad hell yeah no steam still got it oh God what a nail B man  by mid 2015 it was pretty clear that zost was just a complete God at Super Metroid he pushed it more and more simply by executing the route better getting better RNG and by being zost the month of October 2015 was pretty solid for Super Metroid s got a new record of 4232 on October 10th 8 days later he took 2 seconds off of it the next day he took another 2 seconds off 3 Days Later another 3 seconds came off and finally 4 days later on October 26th he took 13 more seconds [Music] off what we got holyo 4213 wa that's a 28 my friends he improved the Super Metroid record five times in one month and took half a minute off the Record in process s seemed to be the Undisputed champion of Super Metroid speedrunning but do you guys remember that guy oats and goats I was talking [Music] about yes woo yes yes woo yeah dude we got it dude yes yes we got it after having steadily improved his own personal best for months oats and goats was able to take the world record from the legendary zost by a few seconds the time was down to a low 42 so naturally as all speedrunners would do everyone was anticipating the 41 minute time Z and oats both wanted it so they both started grinding it Z wasn't streaming attempts quite as often but oats was streaming 41 attempts nearly every day ultimately though zos was the first one to find success he started by tying oats 4210 then lowered the record by 5 Seconds a few months later finally in September 2016 he did it he got a 4158 offline and then replayed it on his stream but oats wasn't about to give up he knew that he had the skill to get the record back so he kept pushing forward even though it was incredibly frustrating sometimes and then on October 18th 2016 everything was coming together he cleared boss after boss difficult section after difficult section and then it was on to the Escape not looking not looking that's it baby that's it yeah oh yeah that's it and as of February 2017 that's where the world record stands Super Metroid has been on the Forefront of the speedrunning community ever since speed were even a thing it's been one of the most coveted records and every time the record has changed hands it's brought in a wave of attention to the game and to the runners this game requires so much an insane amount of skill a ton of RNG and a seemingly ending amount of patience and persistence while the record keeps getting so optimized who knows what new strategies will be discovered or if Behemoth will do his thing again and completely revolutionize the game although he does stream now it's unlikely that he would to find it in secret this game has a long and treasured past and it's sure to have a thrilling future as well thanks for watching everyone I'll see you next time
