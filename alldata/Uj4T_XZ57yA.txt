ladies and gentlemen do you remember where you were when you crossed 1200 chess ELO no are you still rated half of that do you remember where you were when you got your first brilliant move on chess.com you also don't remember that one well in this video I'm going to be sharing with you a fascinating game played by a Gotham chess subscriber at that ELO and the motto of the game is never resign oh before we jump into the game I'd like to thank the sponsor of today's video Opera my friends say hello to Opera one Opera one is the latest version of the Opera browser with a completely redesigned look and new functionality it has tons of features and a modular design so your browsing experience is completely personalized I mean just look at this beauty Opera one has been

for the future first you have dynamically adjusting elements in the sidebar second as extensions become more and more prevalent with generative AI features Opera one groups them all together in a collapsible module in the address bar and third did somebody say AI yes obviously that was me I just said AI well opera one has one called Arya Arya can be used to explain or summarize something that you read it can be used to write you a haiku it can also be used to generate some creative ideas Arya can't play chess yet but if it can I will embarrass it in a YouTube video and as a bonus Opera one also also tab Islands tab Islands lets you easily organize tabs collapse or expand them based on a certain group just so you can focus on one thing at a time so you can work shop or research without it all blending into chaos to get started with Opera today click the link in the description below and give the Opera One browser a try for free let's get back to the video our two main characters are both Americans they are both granted Grand Master titles and we will be following the action between Pepsi boy and Trey yes those are their legal names on their passports Pepsi boy one word uh for legal reasons this video is not sponsored by Pepsi you can drink Pepsi Coca-Cola any other smaller brands or you don't have to drink soda at all uh Pepsi boy uh and Trey begin this game like any 1200 ELO players in the world is a double London as if as if one London was not good enough they both play a London okay completely fine obviously nothing wrong with this uh experienced London players know that the best way to challenge a person that also plays the London uh is to turn the game back into a Queen's Gambit with the move C4 uh and then Knight C3 and oftentimes you can get a queen here put pressure on this Pawn which no longer has good defense uh or you could just play it like a like a normal London Bishop to D3 also completely fine uh black now probably should not take probably you should keep the tension you should slide back but black takes on D3 because that's life uh and now either taking with the pawn or the queen is good the pawn is good because it completely controls these squares and also the queen can go out this way and white can use the open C file in the future but taking with the queen is good because you don't double your pawns and because the queen can go this way and the queen can attack so everything is fine so far I don't hate what anybody's done black plays Pawn to E6 one thing that black did do is put the knight in front of the C Pawn which you you should not do that unless you really know what you're doing uh for example if you're playing a kind of like a knight C3 Bishop F4 London where you're trying to play a knight to B5 maybe but I don't really think that that's what black is doing but again everybody's developing life is good uh and now Bishop D6 and now Pepsi boy does something really smart doesn't take see a lot of like 900s would go oh well they took my Bishop so you know I'm gonna take their Bishop because for some reason we like to copy people in chess but you don't have to do that uh in the London if you control the two Central squares then you're gonna win the game for example you know if if you can put a knight on E5 successfully and launch some sort of attack at the opponent while they can't put the Knight on your Center you're gonna be very happy uh this is also a very smart move fighting still for the control and taking would not be that great because it would open up White's Rook so one way for black to get into a lot of trouble very fast is opening up whites attacking possibilities on the h-file because now white is just one moment away or some for example G4 try to go G5 if the Knight comes here you have Knight bd2 like what black could get a completely losing position very very fast uh but I have to give credit where it's due because black doesn't do that so black takes helping out white and now black plays the move Queen to E7 uh and queen 2e7 has two different ideas and listen this is why I like covering 1200 games because while we are going to laugh at the like plethora of really idiotic things that are about to happen because that's what you know this how to lose that chess playlist that I have on YouTube is all about it's what it's all about rather um you're still going to learn a lot because 1200s are actually much better than a lot of you watching this video right now I think the average ELO of a Gotham chess viewer not as an insult just purely from the standpoint of Chess enthusiasm is like seven eight hundred so you should not feel embarrassed if you're 500 or 400 or you know not yet 1200 I mean think of it like this I'm nearly 28 and I have played chess for 23 years and I am still not a grand master and I'm almost bald so you know yeah anyway I I don't know what that has to do with anything I kind of just turned that into a therapy session my point is you should not be embarrassed if your ELO is triple digits um so Queen to E7 is trying to prepare long castling because black actually very smart doesn't want to get in trouble over here and that's exactly what black does black plays long castles now what white should do here is okay they committed the King right that's what they did so I'm gonna attack and black might strike the center but now you have a check now you're gonna win this pawn and if black weights with something like King B8 B5 Knight comes here Knight B3 all of a sudden you know now now The Rook is pointing at the king over here as well I mean it's not it's not getting any better so white does try to attack but in a kind of a bad way white plays C4 uh and it gets really bad because C4 opens up the C file but it probably would have been better for white to attack with the queen because white goes here to try to play Rook C1 I guess uh but things spin out of control very quickly in this position black plays Knight D7 which is a crazy move like the fact that this 1200 even knows pieces are allowed to go backwards in the game is impressive because I thought you had to get to like 1500 to unlock that skill you know like in the video games like I thought chess.com wouldn't even let you move pieces backwards until you got to a certain level um now Pepsi boy plays Rook C1 which was the entire idea which is why Pepsi boy played C4 I don't like it because it weakens the before square a lot and that's going to become relevant in a moment because after Rook C1 uh Trey plays E5 and and now now we have a very instructive moment E5 so white can take that three different ways right uh and white can also not take it white can push and white can also do something completely different but the thing is if white plays A3 why it's just gonna lose a piece so you have to think about what is Black's threat here okay however if you take you gotta realize that you're gonna get hit with two attacks right away and if you move the knight's coming in so you got to give a check you have to seize back the tempo of the game does that make sense you have to play the most forcing move on the board to make your opponent react to you because if you don't they're going to just completely take over the game so if the King was on B8 in that position like if the king is on B8 in this position white is completely lost but because white has this check white is doing well so E5 is played D5 would be another interesting move and then after this Fork you would need to save your queen if they take your knight you take their Knight if they go here you're taking with checks so you're winning um very complex position unfortunately white like you should be taking with what's worth the least just in case white doesn't do that so white takes with what's worth the most in that instance because White had no other way to take so white takes with a knight and now it was just lost so white is lost because white cannot take because of this had black taken like this why it would have been fine because white would have still had this check but unfortunately now after take take that's it you are just losing you're losing because you can give this check but I'm gonna block with the Knight and that's it and you can threaten mate but I'm not gonna get mated because I'm gonna play C6 or Knight F6 or whatever so very tragic okay and the way you avoid that is you gotta you gotta think I gotta take with the minimum value or I gotta anticipate the danger in a sophisticated way like maybe Queen E4 would have been better here to pin or something like that but that doesn't happen and that's life and now Queen E4 and uh White is lost white is completely lost white is down a night uh and black plays Queen to B4 check which is the entire reason I did not like the move C4 um I would have liked if White had a Pawn on A3 to prevent any of that from happening anytime you push a pawn you need to think what have I weakened and you need to make a decision like that okay so this is the position Queen B4 King E2 now Queen takes B2 uh White is down three points of material does not have the right to Castle anymore uh and it's only gonna get worse Rook to C2 apparently makes the advantage even more uh in Black's favor the queen comes back to B5 check great move King to E1 and now what I would do here with black is I would just continue obliterating the position if the king tries to defend this pawn it only gets worse because you have a discovered attack and then you win the queen and also Queen B1 check and you win probably even more than the queen like I wouldn't be surprised if mate is coming uh so Queen B5 the king would need to go somewhere else uh like let's say D1 and now you can bring in the other rook and and get in here with the Knight play Queen B1 whatever it's all completely winning so that doesn't happen though um and here's something really weird happens so in this position rather than saving the Knight black plays F6 which doesn't save the knight at all but it actually does in a brilliant way why am I speaking in riddles the night cannot be taken because it is tactically defended why am I continuing to speak in riddles because I'm annoying if you take the Knight I just said every time a pawn moves and frankly anytime any piece moves in chess you need to think about what pieces now see what in this position the pawn took the Knight Now The Rook sees the entire defile that was not the case a move ago so after Pawn takes Knight all of a sudden Queen B1 and the King cannot sidestep anywhere except E2 and now you're gonna lose the Rook that's brutal okay so now you know a moment ago this wouldn't have been the case but it is now King to E1 and could the queen have gone here and try to win like this yes but then maybe there would have been a Checkmate possibility but obviously you would have defended white would have tried to pillage over here yes absolutely but you've got to be very careful okay so in reality this is like a weird genius idea where the Knight is tactically defended because the D file is going to open up and so at the end of the sequence there's going to be a mate threat so that did not exist a moment ago so white is just totally like hopelessly lost because of that uh White doesn't get any counter play at all uh and by the way that happened D5 Queen B1 check and in this position what wait black played F6 tactically defending the black spent one second on that move what you got four minutes and 20 seconds to do that and you go here and I got news for you white doesn't even have to repeat like why could it play Queen C4 and just got into a rook end game but instead of that White's King now makes an escape it just escapes out oh my God what is happening now it gets even worse for black in this position black of course should be taking the pawn and recreating an attack on the king instead of that black plays F5 oh my goodness but I got news for you my friends F5 is once again F5 is not a mouse lip F5 is a is a is a brilliant move in Disguise you know why because the idea is to play check attacking the king but Rook f8 black mist that it was Czech you understand Black's idea was the queen is gonna take and then I'm gonna pin to the king black forgot that when Queen takes Pawn it's check which is which is tough that's tough and by the way mini lesson I just told you every time a piece moves the board changes so if in this position white played Pawn to E6 attacking The Rook the queens now see each other a door opened that's the way the chessboard works so be very careful okay King to B8 is played and now all white has to do is just bring the queen back if black gives a check believe it or not you run the king to G4 you run the king over here and the king is safe behind the wall of Pawns behind the wall of pieces and the attack will rage on the BNC files and white will probably be successful so Queen takes F5 black has thrown it all away and white gets tunnel vision absolutely brutal that's how it goes and the way you avoid mistakes like this is before you make a move you ask yourself does my opponent have a way of creating a threat against me does my opponent have a way of creating a threat against me before you play a move in chess you must ask yourself can they check my king can they attack my queen can they capture anything there are well there's only one check in this position and it's not particularly good but they do have a way to attack your queen and your king you're getting skewered and not the tasty kind Rook f8 is lights out and you lose the queen now a lot of people would resign here don't play on there is an m in the evaluation all black has to do is Corral the king Queen to D7 check Force the king over here get closer with the queen something like Queen F5 white might take on C7 and you play G6 threatening a mate like the king is gonna run out of oxygen at some point and if not you're just gonna win all the pawns you're gonna take all the pawns and just don't get back ranked mated always play Pawn to A6 make sure your king is breathing room Black plays H5 check Queen D7 the king does run to safety but black is completely winning and does a great job an excellent job protecting their King using the H Pawn as a battering ram and look at this move G5 Pawn Haymaker pulling apart the white pawns why doing a nice job too though keeping the cluster together because if white plays this the split pawns are going to be fatal Queen F5 check picking up this and this and uh the game is going to be over very quickly so Pawn to G3 now black does another night's job you gotta simplify with only one Rook on the board The Rook is not gonna stand up to the queen and now the way black wins this is gets in beats up the king eats the pawns wins the game and then at some point wins The Rook for example Queen D1 check by a miracle does not win The Rook quantity G4 King F2 can the queen sneak into F3 absolutely are you completely winning after Queen F3 absolutely you're gonna win everything check you're trying to get this one too you push your Jeep on like you you're just gonna win this game so black plays Queen D5 Pawn to G4 and queen F3 and does exactly everything that I said uh and now now black is easily winning because all black has to do is move the queen and push the pawn and make sure this Pawn doesn't Queen check and there we go easy peasy two squares away from queening King E6 uh oh I think we know where this is headed they think the king is gonna maybe mate over here oh no black was not gonna end up in a Gotham video that easily of course black was winning with G2 as well there was no way to get mated The Rook is not a kangaroo so it can't jump over anything Rook D7 check the king runs out that's it the king is safe yeah there's nothing now for some reason white continues to move the King Pawn to G2 and Rook G7 but this is over because you could take you play Queen F1 Queen D1 check enables the promotion oh my God he found it oh brutal it's over yeah the pawns are just way too far and uh in this position I mean you can you can bring the king back you can take okay Queen B1 is not the best move I don't know why we wouldn't just take this Pawn but all right but now the Pawn's getting a little close but obviously just bring the king back bring the queen back very easy all right do not give unnecessary checks because when you give unnecessary checks you force the king closer to help the pawn promote okay Free Pawn by the way all right I don't know what that does and you allowed white to get two very closely connected pawns it's time to bring the king enough all right very good now give a check and bring the king and you should be fine but you got to be very careful how you bring the king because here's a nice way you can lose and white would promote to a knight here by the way so King to F7 and uh black plays A5 black just decides ah I'm gonna Queen White is now also a square away from queening very very dangerous if you play A4 I'm gonna make a knight again I'm making a knight and then after take take I go here push push I queen with check so E7 black correctly gives a check King slides forward you got a pin but are we gonna make a draw no white has now two pawns on the seventh rank but you can't queen you can't queen you pinned yourself so black plays A4 yeah Black's just winning King E8 Queen G6 nice pinning from the other side now how do you actually win this game probably have to give a check and then in this position you have to pin here why because of King f8 this is mate so you get the opponent to this position where King f8 is possible and queen h8 is threatened because with the queen here you can't go there but that doesn't happen check game G8 and we're shuffling but is it a draw oh my goodness black is probably panicking a little bit and then decides you know what oh my God black lost the game oh because now the pawn can Queen the pawn the pawn oh but it's still equal because now either of the pawns can Queen check again King f8 and now black just decides I'm gonna make a run for it Palm to E8 what is going on well if we do the math probably in the end game black is still going to win because black has more bonds so that's exactly what black goes for here black goes for the winning Queen and pawn end game if you trade the Queens black has three pawns white has two so black is gonna allow a queen make a queen and run over here and try to win the game that's exactly what black does and so in this position black plays Queen to B4 check Queen E7 take take pushes pushes pushes and gets checkmated in one move
