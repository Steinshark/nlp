- The PC market sucks right now, but ask yourself, did you really have the
money for a new rig anyway? No? Well, how about you just get one for free? That's right, Asus ROG Rig Reboot is back, which means three lucky contestants from the US and Canada will be joining me here in the studio building their very own
brand new gaming PC, courtesy of ASUS ROG. You likey? Well then enter by making
a 60-second YouTube video showing how molasses slow and utterly brick-borked
your current rig is. What's it like to use now? How would you like to be
able to use your new rig? Just follow the link below to submit your YouTube
video and you are set. Just make sure your video is
as creative as possible, guys, because competition is stiff. And if you ain't original,
you ain't gonna win. So don't copy last year's submissions. You also won't win if your video features begging, destroying hardware, or a
ton of fast-moving text. And finally, your video must
be under 60 seconds, got it? 61 seconds equals, it's gone. And while last year, some winners were
working with me remotely. This year, the goal is to bring all of you here to the headquarters. So what are you waiting for? The contest closes in one week, so get started, take your
time, and win that PC. But also go fast, 'cause
you've got a week.
