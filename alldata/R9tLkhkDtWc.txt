squeal versus CSS what's the difference which is better if you had a bingo card for 2023 and you said hey Prime what's the most absurd squares you could put on it cocaine in the White House Theo growing a mustache squeal versus CSS which was better I would have never put the last one the last one is insane okay obviously we're about to get in chat GPT but this is just too exciting because someone literally put their name on this someone put their name on this okay two truths and a lie two truths in the Life Theo has a mustache there's Cokey in the White House and CSS versus squeals gonna be a real article written by a real human squeal has been a standard for his database programming for quite some time CSS acts like as the window dressing for some of your favorite websites what what is happening already it's like they know and yet we still are going with it should the next sentence be hey man this article wouldn't make any sense given the previous statement how do you feel about that maybe you should go read something else I love you with this in mind okay put that in your mind I want you to put it right here now that we've put it right here let's consider the next part what is the difference between these two programming languages we all know CSS is not a touring complete language onto itself but it's actually HTML plus CSS okay there's a stallman quote somewhere in there there's literally a stalman quote just about to happen somewhere in there right okay what you're referring to as CSS as a programming language is actually a CSS HTML uh there are certainly some rather Stark differences to call in mind between squeal and CSS really what might be let's see what while one might be used best in one scenario it might be an absolute abysmal fit for another you don't say Ain't No Way ain't no way if you're new to computer science or just curious a little computer science curious about the acronyms band uh Bandy bandied Band-Aid bandied I don't know how to say that word about the web on a day-to-day basis then you are in the right place okay let's look at these two popular programming languages this guide will cover what they're best at where to use them and actually nuts the bolt difference between full name structured query language cascading stylized sheets function communicating and building databases styling web documents depending on other Frameworks no developers can run and develop databases cannot be CR cannot create web pages developers will need to utilize any compatible Frameworks or HTML with CSS object oriented yes no I cannot believe that this literally just said CSS is not object oriented of course it's object oriented what are you talking about we all know this you can develop classes you can inherit you can override you encapsulate what are you talking about I'm so offended at this this level of misinformation okay squeal versus CSS what's the difference this could literally be I wrote this article no you didn't Warren buffering this literally could be one sentence I I am still tickled to just to death right now it might be an abysmal fit uh in the other I I really really want sequel to CSS compiler I really want this I don't know why but I feel like there's something there I really do feel like that select div where parent is sub CSS selector like think about it like they're they're like we could we could do this like this is actually possible it's actually possible it's actually possible to create a squeal to CSS language the other way I'm not too sure about it I'm not too sure about the other way but I'm quite positive we can definitely go squeal to CSS please write in O camel that's the greatest response absolutely write it no camel uh let's see uh when it comes down to it these two languages couldn't be more different they have two different use cases their overall purpose isn't at all a line that said let's look at these languages and what they can do use cases uh I'm just gonna skip the use cases cases and step to learn and career paths okay we don't need that I want to know some must-known facts and then which one's better okay that's what I really want to know by this AI article okay we're skipping that we're skipping that  right out the right out the gates all right squeal versus CSS must know facts facts about squeal used by Massive companies like Google Amazon and meta unarguable just literally unarguable um the standard in database management languages sees usage in every field you can think of I could probably think of a couple that don't use it let's see facts about CSS has native support for hitmal I actually don't understand what that means isn't it the other way around it's the other way around yeah uh makes designing web pages much a much easier task fair fair easy to pick up it's easier to easy to pick up compared to other web oriented programming languages there's that there's that programming language thing again just close uh just close the article no we gotta we gotta know right now which one is better squeal versus CSS which one is better which should you choose oh gosh there's that word again that I I know I'm spelling saying wrong disparate uh languages have very different use cases as such it really depends on where you see yourself moving in terms of learning to code if you see yourself entering a career in databases or you just want more fully complete your abilities to become a full stack web developer then squeal is the right choice there are many other database languages out there but they all owe some of their structure to squeal itself with how prevalent databases are you'll find plenty of work if you choose to learn squeal I kid you not you're not going to get a job because you just learned squeal okay what am I saying here nobody actually knows in an Ideal World if you have the time and drive learning both should set you oh wait hold on I jumped ahead in contrast CSS isn't a complete Language by itself but could be proved to be a vital component when entering a career in front end web development or web design with the world being the way it is classic world the way it is having a relevant web this is like a phrase that does what does this phrase even mean having a relevant web presence is more important than ever therefore CSS provides a solid foundation for making attractive and Visually Rich web designs in an Ideal World if you have time and drive learning both should set you well or up well for a career in web development there are certainly other applications you can use squeal towards but providing a complete start to finish web presence is still much in demand all right so which one's better huh which one is better can squeal be used for web development squeal isn't strictly a web-based language that said there's a need for databases when constructing full stack applications okay is squeal a complete language it cannot be used uh to develop a web page from scratch where does it come in handy is styling a web page you might develop the backbone of your web project and hitmal but then you'll end up using CSS to sell it okay um this article Liam I hate to tell you this but I really hope that you're also I hope this image is a web is is a chat Jeopardy design um because this is like a troll article this is chat Jeopardy ragebeat okay this article literally makes no sense okay so I'm gonna be real I'm gonna be real here for a second this is actually what I think this is what it's done is I actually think this is a new trend we're going to see which is people are going to be just using most search search terms and then of course like meta topics like versus people love verses telling Chad Jeopardy to write an article posting the article right it's like fully automated oh yeah people love CSS people love squeal people love verses squeal versus CSS update span set color equals red font weight equals bold padding equals 25 pixels where class equals yes and parent in select item from yes yes it is so possible this I I told you going from squeal to CSS is completely possible this is beautiful I've I've just never been so happy in my lifetime if this exists can't wait for the private versus JavaScript oh well it's a better article I like it I like it both are declarative languages thank you for that lovely update the name is the squeelogen
